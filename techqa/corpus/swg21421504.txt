 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote discusses WebSphere Portal remote search service SRVE0203E: Servlet [PseServlet]: com.ibm.hrl.portlets.WsPse.PseServlet was found, but is missing another required class. 

SYMPTOM
 

You cannot successfully configure a WebSphere Portal remote search service even though you correctly specified all the required search service configuration parameters.


CAUSE
 

WebSphere Portal remote search service SystemOut.log shows a classpath/classloader problem:

[1/26/10 14:49:23:046 CST] 00000026 WebExtensionP W Servlet PseServlet is currently unavailable: SRVE0203E: Servlet [PseServlet]: com.ibm.hrl.portlets.WsPse.PseServlet was found, but is missing another required class.
SRVE0206E: This error typically implies that the servlet was originally compiled with classes which cannot be located by the server.
SRVE0187E: Check your classpath to ensure that all classes required by the servlet are present.SRVE0210I: This problem can be debugged by recompiling the servlet using only the classes in the application's runtime classpath
SRVE0234I: Application classpath=[...]



ENVIRONMENT
You want to configure a WebSphere Portal remote search service, either EJB or SOAP.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please verify that you followed the classpath/classloader steps in infocenter Preparing for remote search service [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v6101/admin/srtprrmtsrchsrv.html] below:


 * Extract the Portal Search libraries and add them to the classpath on server1 (remote search server). To do this, proceed as follows:

 *  Create a directory with the name extract under the directory installableApps. Locate the file PseLibs.zip in the directory installableApps and extract its content into the directory extract that you created in the previous step. Open the administrative console. Click Environment > Shared Libraries. Create or modify the new shared library names PSE. Add the libraries extract/lib to the classpath by adding a new line to the classpath and giving the full path: <was_profile_root>/installableApps/extract/lib Click Apply > Save to save your changes to the configuration. 

 * Define a new Classloader for server1 (remote search server). To do this, proceed as follows:

 *  Depending on your version of WebSphere Application Server, make the appropriate selection in the administrative console:  * For WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1: Click Servers > Application Servers. 
    * For WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0: Click Servers > Server types > WebSphere application servers.
   
   Click server1. Under Server Infrastructure > Java and Process Management click Classloaders. Click New and then Apply. Under Additional Properties, click Libraries, then click Add. Select the Library Name PSE from the drop-down list and click OK. Save your changes to the configuration. 


Afterwards, retry the remote search service configuration.
