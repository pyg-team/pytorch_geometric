Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Software Delivery and Lifecycle Patterns for the glibc vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Software Delivery and Lifecycle Patterns requires client action for the glibc vulnerabilities.
The GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.
GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Software Delivery and Lifecycle Patterns 1.0 and 1.0.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM strongly recommends you should contact Red Hat to obtain and install fixes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4.
Alternatively, if you have access to a Yum update repository, you may update the glibc library by using the command: yum update glibc

After the update is applied you need to reboot the system or restart all affected services.
