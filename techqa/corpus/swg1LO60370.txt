ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Note - this issue is similar in error to JTHN8E7S8K  but this
   happens in an
   established client and I have reproduced in the 4/3 build of
   8.5.3 CD4.
   
   IBM/Lotus internal AVP application creates Symphony documents
   Documents and
   Spreadsheets. After it runs during a session in Notes and Notes
   is shutdown,
   Notes will not restart again. This application also creates MS
   Docs using the
   MS related objects and the Notes application will start without
   issues.
   
   When the issue occurs, Notes restarts and the Splash screen is
   displayed you
   will be prompted for your password and then the Loading progress
   bar will start
   again when it gets to 100%.
   
   The only way to recover and start Notes is to remove the
   workspace folder from
   data and lose your preferences.

   Theory -  When the Symphony application object is created the
   path information
   is somehow changed or lost and the restart is unable to load the
   Symphony
   information.
   
   
   **** Steps to Reproduce:
   
   Use the test database included
   
   1. Open the db
   2. run the Agent "LargeSymphonyDoc"
   3. No need to save the Symphony Document when you exit, it is
   optional.
   4. Exit Notes normally
   5, Restart Notes. (at this point Notes may restart normally, if
   it does, repeat
   the action. I have only been able to restart twice before
   reproducing)
   
   6. Notes Splash screen appears and you are prompted for you
   password, then the
   Progress bar moves slowly and starts again when at 100 %
   
   Attachment is SymDoc.nsf
