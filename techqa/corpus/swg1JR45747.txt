APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

 *  If a process instance is suspended using the JavaScript API, a
   subsequent attempt to resume the execution of this process
   instance fails (but there is no message issued or exception
   reported).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   
   If a process instance is suspended using the JavaScript API,
   a subsequent attempt to resume the execution of this process
   instance fails, but there is no message issued or exception
   reported.
   
   Problem Summary:
   When the BPD instance is suspended, the output from the service
   integration is only partially processed and leaves the BPD
   instance in an inconsistent state. Resumption is not possible
   afterwards.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Conclusion:
   
   After applying the interim fix, process instances which are
   suspended via the JavaScript API can be resumed again. This
   applies only to process instances which were suspended while
   the fix was already installed. Instances which were
   suspended before applying this interim fix cannot be resumed.
