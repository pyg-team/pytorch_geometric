ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If multiple DASH servers are configured for HA amd the DB2
   database used for HA crashes or it is shuts down then none of
   the users are able to login to DASH.
   
   
   DASH should still work even if the database is down. However
   some of the functionality may not work but users should be able
   to login and view the pages etc.
   
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue:
   
   1. Setup two or more DASH servers for HA. Join the nodes to the
   cluster.
   
   2. If DB2 database is up then you should be able to login to
   DASH and perform all the tasks.
   
   3. To reproduce this issue shutdown the DB2 database using
   below command.
   
   db2stop
   
   4. Try to login into DASH servers. You will not be able
   to login. Even if you are able to login you may not be able to
   do anything.
   
   5. Start up DB2 by running below command
   db2start
   
   6. You should be able to login to DASH servers. But you may need
   to restart DASH.
