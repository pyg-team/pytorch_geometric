APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product: Tivoli Network Manager
   Component: 5724S4500
   
   Environment:?
   ITNM v4.2 FP3
   
   Symptoms:
   When MTOSISOAP collector can not retrieve the complete list of
   devices from the EMS, it is only retriveing up to 4500 devices
   only as defined in the properties file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  increase the value of DataAcquisition.ManagedElementsBatchSize,
   equal to or great than the total number of the devices in the
   EMS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of the MTOSI Soap collector on ITNM 4.2.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The MTOSI Soap collector only retrieves data up to 4500      *
   * devices. This 4500 figure is as defined for the              *
   * DataAcquisition.ManagedElementsBatchSize properties in the   *
   * collector properties file. If there are more than 4500       *
   * devices reported by the EMS, the remaining devices are not   *
   * discovered. The cause is that there is no implementation of  *
   * the iterator functionality in the MTOSI Soap collector. The  *
   * workaround is to set the value for the                       *
   * DataAcquisition.ManagedElementsBatchSize properties to a     *
   * value higher than the maximum number of devices reported by  *
   * the EMS.                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * 4.2.0-ITNMIP-FP0005                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MTOSI Soap collector will discover all devices using the
   iterator. The device data is discovered in batches, and the
   collector will iterate through the records until no more records
   are reported by the EMS.
