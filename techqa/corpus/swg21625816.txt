QUESTION
 Can you define or change the timeout value for OSLC in IBM Rational ClearQuest requests? 

CAUSE
Currently, OSLC requests time out after 15 seconds, but you want to increase the timeout and set it to 30 seconds to avoid errors.

ANSWER
In only one case you could define the OSLC timeout. There is no simple way to change the timeout settings for all OSLC requests.

Only when OSLC calls rely on the server HTTP Session, you can configure the timeout duration. The following technote provides the details about this case.

Other OSLC calls do not rely on stored session data. Therefore, in theory those types of calls are not subject to timeouts.

OSLC calls might cause opening an HTTP basic authentication prompt. Once the browser receives basic authentication credentials, the browser passes those credentials on every call to the server. Therefore, session timeouts unlikely have an impact.
