Title: IBM Enabling weak cipher suites for Rational Publishing Engine is NOT recommended - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 With the recent attention to RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS, this is a reminder to NOT enable weak or export-level cipher suites for IBM Rational Publishing Engine (RPE) and to disable such cipher suites for servers to which RPE connects. 

CONTENT
Servers to which Rational Publishing Engine connect may be susceptible to RC4 "Mar Mitzvah" Attack for SSL/TLS and this can be prevented by disabling weak or export-level cipher suites. For more details about the server-side configuration needed to prevent such attacks, see this document: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology (CVE-2015-2808) [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21715543] [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21715543]
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
