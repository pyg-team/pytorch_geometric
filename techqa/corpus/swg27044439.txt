Q&A summary 
Audio recording (length 54:45 minutes) 

Approximate time stamp Topic 00:00 Presentation of slides 48:06 Question: After a server restart, the applications start but the servlets do not until the first request comes in. This behavior is slowing down the performance for the first user. Is there a way to resolve this behavior?

Answer: No, there does not appear to be a way to pre-load the servlets you are using. There are some settings in the web.xml that are to pre-load the servlets but not applying in this case. Support is researching your question and will share what we find through your PMR. 49:36 To use the doc viewer plugin for Connections, do we need to install all IBM Docs pieces?

No, you do not need all of IBM Docs. There are six Docs components. If you will only use file viewer, all you need is three of those components: file viewer application server, the conversion application server, and file viewer plug-in. 50:26 For surveys and polls, is it a widget or do I run a task for setup?

Surveys is a widget, working with IBM Forms Experience Builder. To use, you first install and set up Forms Experience Builder. To integrate the two, you update the widgetconfig.xml file on the Connections community server and add jar files on the Forms server to allow the two-way communication. When you create a survey widget in a Community, that action creates a form on the Forms server and assigns that community to the form. Refer to the slides in the presentation above for details. 52:55 I do not see an editor, like the EditLive rich text editor, for the community description. Is this function coming in a future release?

The text limit for the description is configurable; see the product documentation. As far as rich text editing, we're not aware of plans at this time but that feature has been requested.

What are CCM and Ephox? CCM = Connections Content Manager. It's our integration of Connections and FileNet with the library widget in Communities. Ephox is Ephox Edit Live. It's a new full feature text editor used in blogs, wiki's, etc. Is IBM Docs (Doc viewer) a separate installation? And this viewer has use only during the document preview in activity stream, right? Docs and Docs File Viewer is a separate install. File viewer is used in document preview, the new thumbnail view in Files and Activity Stream. IBM Docs gives you the ability to create documents, spreadsheets and presentation online as well as edit those in a group setting, all online.

During the presentation, you mention files and CCM go in File system and Databases separately. We have both Files and CCM components. How is that stored? In both cases we store the actual file on the network share drive. In the DB, we store the meta-data, filename and location the file exists on the file store. Has any sizable environment ever done an in-place upgrade? One support panelist has seen a couple but most sizable environments are done side-by-side. Can we migrate from V3 to V5? You run the DB upgrade scripts from 3.0 to 4.0, then the upgrade scripts from 4.0 to 5.0. You would not need to install a 4.0 Connections server, just a 5.0 server that you will migrate the 3.0 - 4.0 - 5.0 data to. How about the compatibility of the Ephox RTE within newer versions of Java? Are those warnings and applet-based packaging being used in this Ephox? EditLive is only supported for Java 1.6 & 1.7 Besides the IBM documentation, anyone have a guide to do a side-by-side upgrade? Is there a zero-to-hero guide for version 5? There is an informative blog written by one of our IBM champions: http://turtleblog.info/2014/09/30/my-connections-migration-checklist/ [http://turtleblog.info/2014/09/30/my-connections-migration-checklist/] No zero-to-hero guide exists for 5.0; prior versions are in the IBM Connections wiki. The panelists noted this request and will look into publishing a similar guide for 5.0. 

We have issues installing Cognos on Linux cluster environment. Have you installed successfully? Yes, I have installed Cognos successfully. It's easier in 5.0 because there is a wizard now. Typically the issues I see are problems getting the metrics running, due to the 32-bit Oracle or DB2 client not being installed. When installing Cognos transformer, we are getting "Segmentation Fault" error running build-all.sh. We have 32 and 64 bit libraries. That sounds like a problem with the db client. You can go to /cognos/servlet/dispatch/ext, and navigate to the DB configurations and make sure we are able to connect to the db via the client and JDBC drivers. It may be best to open a service request to troubleshoot further. Is the Quickr Plug-in still required for Round-Trip Editing? The desktop plugins will allow you to do round trip editing; the documentation will be updated for this soon. Is it required to edit the files_config.xml for round trip editing to work with the Desktop Plugin and not use the quickr plugin? The file to edit is library-config.xml. That feature may not be completely ready yet with CR1, but is expected, along with documentation updates, for CR2. Round trip editing works with CR1 as long as you have updated the library plugin.
