QUESTION
 How can we integrate with Microsoft Exchange Server using Cast Iron? 

ANSWER
We can use the WSDL which is provided Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to integrate with Cast Iron.

Cast Iron cannot connect to the previous exchange server versions as there is no support for web services for those versions. For integrating with previous version, HTTP WebDAV protocol can be used.
