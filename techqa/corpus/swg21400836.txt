 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I facing a "shared libraries: libdl.so.2" error? 

CAUSE
This kind of issue can be raised in some Linux distributions, for example Red Hat 9 or Suse 9.0, when the shared libraries called by the installer are linked to a not compatible OS API version through the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL variable

ANSWER
Error messages like the following:
awk: error while loading shared libraries: libdl.so.2: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
dirname: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: error while loading shared libraries: librt.so.1: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
basename: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
dirname: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
basename: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
hostname: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory
means that the option LD_ASSUME_KERNEL is not supported by the current jdk. 

In order to execute the program you need to comment the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL messages. Make sure that the same number of characters is used. You can do that using the example in following scripts: 

#create a backup file
-bash-3.1$ cp JRules.bin JRules.bin.bak
#comment the option out
-bash-3.1$ cat JRules.bin.bak | sed "s/export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/#xport 
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/" > JRules.bin
