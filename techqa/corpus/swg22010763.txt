Title: IBM How to avoid Sweet32 Vulnerability in SKLM on port 443 - United States

Text:
sweet32 port 443 sklm WAS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Vulnerability scan shows port 443 is vulnerable to sweet32 attack.
CVE CVE-2016-2183 


SYMPTOM
The following vulnerability have been scanned in the SKLM server: 

 [Port 443] SSL 64-bit Block Size Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)

The SKLM server is found to support the following 64-bit block cipher suites:
- Medium Strength Ciphers (> 64-bit and < 112-bit key, or 3DES) DES-CBC3-SHA(FIPS) Kx=RSA Au=RSA Enc=3DES-CBC(168) Mac



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

If port 443 is opened for the web console of SKLM then its SKLM is the one experiencing the sweet32 vulnerability attack. Try below steps for WAS:


WAS side steps:
For the WAS servers, you can remove any 3DES ciphers from the SSL configurations being used by the servers:

1. Go to "Quality of protection (QoP) settings" panel by going ...SSL certificate and key management > SSL configurations > (SSL config
name) > Quality of protection (QoP) settings

2. On the panel, select "Strong" in "Cipher suite settings" and press "Update selected ciphers" so that in "Cipher suites" section, you will
see strong ciphers in "Selected ciphers" (Right hand side) "

3. Examine the list of "Selected ciphers" one by one to make sure none of them contain the following strings

_3DES_

If any do, select them and press "Remove" button to remove it from Selected ciphers.

4. Once we have good ciphers in "Selected ciphers", press "Apply" or "OK" and save the ciphers.

5. Use this SSL configuration for SSL communication.
