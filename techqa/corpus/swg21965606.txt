Title: IBM Why action results reported from client to server might get delayed - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After running an action on a client, the action status will be always reported back after 20 minutes. 


SYMPTOM
1) From the debug client log, there is time gap between "Attempting to post report" and "Report posted successfully".
Fri, 05 Jun 2015 17:13:46 +0900 VerboseMessage Entering Reporting Logic.
Fri, 05 Jun 2015 17:32:35 +0900 DebugMessage ReportManager - Attempting to post report
Fri, 05 Jun 2015 17:32:35 +0900 DebugMessage DoUploadFile: None authentication used.
Fri, 05 Jun 2015 17:32:35 +0900 DebugMessage Report posted successfully

2) From the usage profiler log, the property took long to evaluate on the problematic machine.
1) 1120.305: Software Distribution.11:Evaluate Property 1


CAUSE
Whenever the client generates a report, it has to evaluate all properties with a frequency of "Every Report" or of which the reporting frequency has been reached. So if this process takes long, you can be sure there are some time-consuming properties set to be evaluated in every report. 

The analysis "Software Distribution Deployment Results" (ID:11) includes properties which is set with a frequency of "Every Report".
This analysis displays the deployment results of software deployed. The log is stored at "\BES Client\__BESData\__Global\SWDDeployData\SWD_DeploymentResults.log".
If this log file above is very large in size, such as 3MB, it will take much time to evaluate its properties.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) You can manually delete the contents in the log file "\BES Client\__BESData\__Global\SWDDeployData\SWD_DeploymentResults.log". 


2) There is a task in the SWD site called "IBM BigFix Client: Clear Software Distribution Logs Exceeding 1 MB," that can be used to remove the logs once they get over 1MB. 
If you deploy this task periodically or as a policy, you can keep the logs under control.
