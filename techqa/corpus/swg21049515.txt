PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The base FMID for CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) will not install due to unresolved HIPER APARs. You receive a message like the following for at least one APAR:

GIM35950I 1 ERROR HOLD AQ47048 WAS NOT RESOLVED. EXCLUDED SYSMOD UQ54619 WOULD HAVE SUPERSEDED AQ47048. 

CAUSE
Reference web site: http://service.software.ibm.com/390holddata.html [http://service.software.ibm.com/390holddata.html]. This site indicates FMIDs will not be allowed to install when there is an outstanding unresolved HIPER APAR.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To get around this problem include the following parameters in your SMP/E JCL:


 1. To bypass the HIPER APARs:
    APPLY SELECT(fmid)
    GROUPEXTEND
    BYPASS HOLDERROR(XXnnnn) HOLDSYSTEM 
    
    Where fmid is the CICS FMID you are installing and XXnnnn is the APAR to be bypassed. For example, you would include AQ47048 in response to the GIM35950I message included in this problem.
    
    If there are multiple HIPERs with PE chains, you can either bypass the HOLDERROR for each APAR or code BYPASS (HOLDCLASS(HIPER)) to bypass all HIPER APARS to allow the base product to be applied. 
    
    
 2. To install the FMID: 
    APPLY SELECT FORFMID(fmid)
    BYPASS HOLDERROR HOLDSYSTEM
    
    
 3. To identify any missing HIPER maintenance after the FMID is installed:
    REPORT ERRSYSMODS 



You will then need to research each HIPER APAR and take appropriate action.
