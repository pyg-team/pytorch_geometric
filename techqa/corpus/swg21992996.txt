Text:
CVE-2016-6304 CVE-2016-2182 CVE-2016-2177 CVE-2016-2178 CVE-2016-6306 CVE-2016-2183 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 22 and 26, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. IBM DataPower Gateways has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By repeatedly requesting renegotiation, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large OCSP Status Request extension to consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2182 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2182]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds write in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted value to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116342 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116342] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6306 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6306]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing message length checks when parsing certificates. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
