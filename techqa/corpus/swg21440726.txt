 User Registration and Login Issues 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

 Considerations before collecting data 
Take note of the following before collecting the information described below:

 * Performance  * Runtime tracing may be verbose, and it could impact performance during peak time. If possible, reproduce the problem on a non-production environment to capture tracing.
      
   
    *  If using WebSphere Version 8, there is an option to utilize High Performance Extensible Logging(HPEL) to minimize the impact of logging and tracing. The logs need to be formatted using the logViewer utility [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rtrb_logviewer.html] before uploading to IBM. For more information on enabling HPEL, refer to WebSphere Knowledge Center Using HPEL to troubleshoot applications [ https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/ttrb_usinghpel.html].
   
   

 * Security  * Some trace strings could capture sensitive or personal infomation. Please be sure to sanitize the logs before uploading to IBM. Commerce uses data masking to help mask sensitive data. See Knowledge Center Masking Sensitive data in traces [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZLC2_7.0.0/com.ibm.commerce.developer.doc/concepts/csdlogging.htm?lang=en]
   
   


 COLLECTING DATA 
 I. Configure environment 

Follow the instructions below to configure your environment to capture the required diagnostic information: 

 1. Update the size of the trace files to 20MB and the number of historical trace files retained to 20. If using HPEL, set maximum size to at least 500MB.
 2. Enable the following runtime trace string:
    
    com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_SERVER=all: com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_USER=all: com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_ACCESSCONTROL=all
     *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif]Enabling trace What is this data These trace components increase the amount of diagnostic data logged to the WebSphere server trace file. Why do I need this data This data will capture more detailed diagnostic trace information for the subject component. Where can I find this data Please look at the following Commerce Information Center documentation for more information on enabling Commerce trace components:  1.

You may also want to consider the Access Control MustGather [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21442597] if you get an access control error when trying to register or login to the site. 




 II. Reproduce problem 

 Recreate the problem by logging in the same user again, or trying to register the user again, and take note of any user details or user IDs that may help with troubleshooting the problem. 





ll. Validate the issue was captured 
Before sending logs to IBM, ensure that the issue being reported was captured. Recommend to review the following documents to help facilitate proper log collection: Avoiding pitfalls when collecting traces. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648137] 




 IV. Collect data 

Include the general information requested in MustGather: General Issues in WebSphere Commerce [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21440709] alongside the component-specific information requested below. 


 1. Collect the following files from the system:  1. WC_eardir/xml/member/MemberRegistrationAttributes.xml1 
     2. WC_profiledir/logs/server_name/logs/SystemOut*2 
     3. WC_profiledir/logs/server_name/logs/trace*3 
    
    
 2.  *Naming conventions can be found here [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wchelp/v7r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.commerce.base.doc/misc/mabhelp.htm].
 3. 
 4.  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif]What are these files? 1 Determines the roles assigned to a user when they register 2 Runtime output log 3 Runtime trace log 
 5. 
 6. Run the following database queries to collect the necessary information from your database (output results in CSV format): 
    Query Output file name SELECT * FROM SITE SITE.csv select * from STORE STORE.csv select * from STOREENT STOREENT.csv select * from USERS where USERS_ID = {user who logged in} USERS.csv select * from USERREG where USERS_ID = {user who logged in} USERREG.csv select * from MEMBER where MEMBER_ID = {user who logged in} MEMBER.csv select * from MBRROLE where MEMBER_ID = {user who logged in} MBRROLE.csv select * from ORGENTITY ORGENTITY.csv select * fom MBRREL where DESCENDANT_ID in (select ORGENTITY_ID as DESCENDANT_ID from ORGENTITY) MBRREL_ORGS.csv select * fom MBRREL where DESCENDANT_ID = {user who logged in} MBRREL_USER.csv 






 SUBMITTING DATA TO IBM SUPPORT 
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR) 
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
