APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Appservers that host applications should post workclasses
   related to these applications as part of the On Demand
   Configuration tree so that these applications can be served
   requests even in the absence of the Deployment Manager. This
   behaviour does  not happen today. This defect  will address
   this problem.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Application Server        *
   *                 Extended Deployment version 6 using the      *
   *                 ODR to route traffic.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Routing of requests to application      *
   *                      servers hosting applications by the     *
   *                      ODR may be erroneous.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using ODR(s) to route traffic to an application server
   cluster with one or more servers in it, routing is dependent
   on work class information that is shared via the on-demand
   configuration that is shared between the ODRs and the
   application servers. The problem that is being fixed by this
   APAR is that only the deployment manager is posting work
   class related information to the on-demand configuration
   today. In the absence of the deployment manager, or when the
   deployment manager is down, this information is not available
   and hence routing of requests may fail or may be error prone.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix ensures that the application servers start posting
   work class information to the on-demand configuration as
   well, by virtue of which this information will be available
   to the routing decision making ODRs even when the deployment
   manager is down or unavailable. This fix will be available
   as part of 6.0.2.3.
