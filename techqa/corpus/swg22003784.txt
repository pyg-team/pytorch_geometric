CAUSE
Limitation of Controller (caused by a limitation in Microsoft SQL) which is triggered by choosing too many periods to export at once.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reduce the number of separate periods to be exported. 

 * In other words, export the data in separate chunks (each with fewer periods) rather than in one go (with all periods selected).
