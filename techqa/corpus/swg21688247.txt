Title: IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application cluster server region will not start after upgrading WebSphere Application Server (WAS) - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you configured an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.0.1 deployment environment, such as on z/OS with WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5.1, and updated to WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5.2 by switching symbolic links without changing the BPM version, the application cluster servant region will not start after restarting the BPM environment. 

SYMPTOM
The trace file shows the following error message: 


BMWRW0002I: Starting Lotus Mashups OSGI Bundles org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.PackageNotFoundException: Package with uri 'http://www.ibm.com/websphere/appserver/schemas/5.0/resources.jdbc.xmi' not found. (file:/WebSphere/p3cell/p3nodee/AppServer/profiles/default/config/cells/p3cell/nodes/p3nodee/servers//p3sr01e/resources.xml, 3, 261)


CAUSE
Upgrading WebSphere Application Server can reset the <install_root>/configuration/config.ini file to its shipped default contents, causing the IBM BPM customization for Business Space to be lost. This can happen on z/OS as well as on distributed platforms.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Instead of updating <install_root>/configuration/config.ini with the setting that Business Space requires, define a JVM argument for the WebSphere server JVMs that run Business Space. 

In the administrative console, go to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers. For each IBM BPM application cluster member (IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced), or for the single BPM application server (BPM Express), perform the following steps: 

 1. In the Name column, select the server link. 
 2. In the Server Infrastructure section, expand Java and Process Management and select Process definition. 
 3. In the Additional Properties section, select Java Virtual Machine. 
 4. If "-Declipse.bundle.setTCCL=false" is not shown in the Generic JVM arguments field, add it and save your changes. 
 5. For IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced only, synchronize your changes to the managed nodes. 
 6. To pick up the configuration changes, restart the IBM BPM application cluster (IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced) or the single IBM BPM application server (IBM BPM Express).
