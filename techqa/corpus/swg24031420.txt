ABSTRACT
 Dynamic weights are not calculated correctly by dynamic workload management (DWLM) in certain situations. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
PM37444 resolves the following problem:

ERROR DESCRIPTION: 
Provide ability to disable usage of EJB statistics in the calculation of dynamic weight for a dynamic cluster member. This is required in certain situations, such as, when EJB traffic is not being sent through the ODR and there is no need to load balance the EJB traffic, or EJB traffic is driven through the web artifacts like servlets and web service time is inclusive of EJB response time. 

LOCAL FIX: 
N/A 

PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
All users of WebSphere Virtual Enterprise who are using dynamic clusters that have Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and web applications

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Dynamic weights are not calculated correctly by dynamic workload management (DWLM) in certain situations.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

The ability to disable the usage of EJB statistics when calculating dynamic weight for a dynamic cluster member should be supported. This support is required in certain situations, such as when EJB traffic is not sent through the ODR and there is no need for the load balancing of the EJB traffic. Another example of when this support is needed is when EJB traffic is driven through web artifacts.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 
The issue is fixed by setting the ignoreEJBStats custom property to true at the cell or dynamic cluster level. Setting the custom property at the cell level affects all the dynamic clusters in the cell, which must be recycled for the custom property changes to take effect. When the custom property is set to true, DWLM ignore EJB statistics during the weight calculation. The default value for the custom property is 
false. 

This fix will be included in the next available fix pack for WebSphere Virtual Enterprise.
