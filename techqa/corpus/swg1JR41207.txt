APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Workmanager-based navigation, the BPC engine can be caught
   in infinite message processing loops, if process context
   information for certain instances in the BPEDB has been
   corrupted. The fix will change the handling
    of database errors to avoid such loops and to allow for the
   continued processing of unaffected instances.  Rationale: If
   there is no database corruption, then this Fix is not needed.
   But if there is a database corruption, then without the fix the
    whole system can be rendered unusable, while with the fix only
   the affected process instances stop working.
