QUESTION
Are the WebSphere plug-ins for IHS and IIS supported for use with Domino?


ANSWER
No. Neither the WebSphere plug-in for IHS nor the WebSphere plug-in for IIS are supported for use with Domino. 

Although these plug-ins have been used in some environments to redirect HTTP requests from a front-end Web server to a back-end Domino Web server, that configuration is not supported by IBM. 

Note: The IHS server bundled with Domino 9.0.x does not require use of WebSphere plug-ins.
