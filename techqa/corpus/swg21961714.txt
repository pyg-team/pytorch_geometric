VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]

DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
