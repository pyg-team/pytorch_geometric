Title: IBM VScan rules are not executing with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture DotScan - United States

Text:
DotScan rules execution VScan TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using IBM Datacap Taskmaster DotScan to execute the VScan task, rules configured for VScan in Datacap Studio are not executed. 

SYMPTOM
The expected rules configured for the VScan task Rulesets are not executed. A simple example is the following Ruleset where the rrSet action is configured to set a batch level variable called ScannedDate: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&amp;aid=1] 

 

When executing VScan through Taskmaster Rulerunner Manager (formerly known as Quattro), rules get executed properly and the ScannedDate variable appears at the batch level in the vscan.xml as follows: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=2] 

However, when running VScan through the Taskmaster DotScan application, rules are not executed and the ScannedDate variable is not present in vscan.xml.


CAUSE
When using Taskmaster DotScan to execute the VScan task, DotScan operates in interactive mode where the user can specify a location to upload files. In this interactive mode, DotScan uses the VScan panel which does not execute rules. In order to execute rules for VScan, the default Rulerunner panel should be used to execute background tasks.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The setting to change the DotScan VScan panel is configured in Taskmaster Web. 

In Taskmaster Web, click on Administrator and expand the Workflow hierarchy to the VScan task. 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=3] 



Click on the Setup... link on the right pane. In the Setup popup window, scroll down to the DotScan section. By default, the User Interface Panel should be set to VScan which is the interactive user interface panel. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=4]


Change this User Interface Panel value to Default which is the Rulerunner background panel.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612634&aid=5]


Scroll down to the bottom and click Save. 

Now run the VScan task within Taskmaster DotScan and the rules should be executed as the VScan task will operate in background mode.
