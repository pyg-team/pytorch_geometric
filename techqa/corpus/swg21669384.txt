QUESTION
 How do you obtain a license or activation kit after upgrading to IBM Rational Developer for i Series (RDi)? 

CAUSE
Depending on how you downloaded the product either from AAS/ESS or from Passport Advantage, the license/activation kit may either be with a part of the purchased images or it might be in a separate part.

ANSWER
If the product is purchased in Passport Advantage, the activation kits can be downloaded from the 
IBM Rational License Key Center [http://www.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/] or Passport Advantage as the license is now provided with the product downloads. 


If the product is purchased in eConfig/AAS, the activation kit is included with the product on the ESS site [http://www-304.ibm.com/servers/eserver/ess/index.wss].
