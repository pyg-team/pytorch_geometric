 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I see that the WebSphere Cast Iron v6 Hypervisor Edition (HVE) product documentation provides information for running Cast Iron HVE in a Xen Hypervisor 4.0 environment. What edition or brand of Xen is supported by Cast Iron Hypervisor Edition v6.x? Does Cast Iron HVE v7.x support the Xen server hosting environment? 

ANSWER
For Cast Iron Hypervisor Edition v6.x releases, Cast Iron supports only the open source version of Xen v4 at xenproject.org. 

Note that in Cast Iron Hypervisor Edition v7.0.0.0 only, the Xen server hosting environment is not supported. Please see the information at the following link for more information:

For Cast Iron Hypervisor Edition v7.0.0.1 and above, support is reestablished for the Xen server hosting environment, specifically for xenproject.org's open source version of Xen server 4.1.2 running on Red Hat Enterprise Linuxâ„¢ Server release 5.6, and later, 6.0 .
