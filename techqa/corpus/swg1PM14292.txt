APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the 'WHERE' keyword with a LISTOF property, the filte
   r doesn't work as expected. The item is not listed after clickin
   g on Choices. It will only show items if there is only 1 value i
   n the ListOf property and that value matches the filter specifie
   d in the WHERE clause in USRPROPS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If more than one value is listed in the LISTOF property,
   then the WHERE keyword will not work as expected. The
   CHOICES list will not list any items that contain multiple
   items in the LISTOF property. It will only show items if
   there is only 1 value in the ListOf property and that value
   matches the filter specified in the WHERE clause in
   USRPROPS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is a WAD.
   The WHERE clause filters definitions based upon a property
   value and not upon a string included in a property value.
   In the case described in this report, the property value is
   
   ""My Program"
   Program"
   
   therefore it is not the same thing as "Program"...
