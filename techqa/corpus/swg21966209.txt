Text:
CVE-2013-7423; CVE-2015-1781 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM DataPower Gateways has addressed a vulnerability in the standard C library that it uses to access DNS. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the writing of DNS queries to random file descriptors under high load by the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. 
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100647 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100647] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the gethostbyname_r() and other related functions. By sending a specially-crafted argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system elevated privileges or cause the application to crash. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102500 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102500] for the current score
