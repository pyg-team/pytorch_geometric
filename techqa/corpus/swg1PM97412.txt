ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue upgrading or installing a specific portlet using the
   portaladministration console.We fixed the problem by
   having the customer manually add "wps.appserver.name" to the
   DeploymentService properties with the Cluster Name in it.
   Question remains as to why this must be manually set.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  add the wps.appserver.name=ClusterName entry to
   wp_profile/PortalServer/config/DeploymentService.properties
