Title: IBM I am receiving 'Reserved error (-7749); There is no message for this error' from Microsoft Access - United States

Text:
ms access; Microsoft Access; Reserved Error; -7749; connectivity TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I receive the -7749 error message while linking a table with an index on expression defined using Microsoft Access connecting to a database on DB2 V9 for z/OS. 

SYMPTOM
I am unable to connect via Microsoft Access while the index on expression is defined. This includes UPPER, DATE, SUBSTR, as well as IBM supplied functions. A CLI trace will likely reveal: 

( Unretrieved error message="[IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0133E Option type out of range. SQLSTATE=S1092" )


CAUSE
Issue with how metadata stored procedures return data


ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Access 2007, DB2 Connect V9.x, DB2 for z/OS V9 NFM



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply the PTF PK80997 on the z/OS server or you may drop and recreate the index on expression as a regular index
