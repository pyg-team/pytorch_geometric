APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For Content Platform Engine (CPE) and Content Search Services
   Customers (CSS) using IBM Content Collector (ICC) for document
   indexing ingestion, a new message type is required for specific
   document level errors that fall into the category of
   'unrecognized format' according to the current IBM Content
   Collector parsers. This new type will allow ICC Support for
   Content Search Services to better handle the case when an
   unrecognized email format is encountered.
   
   
   Results
   -------
   Actual Results:
   As it is now, when an unrecognized email format is encountered,
   there is a TASK_ERROR being thrown which fails an entire CPE
   batch instead of just the single email that is unrecognized.
   This leads to situations where the IndexRequests can build up
   and you will see the retry counts going up on the failing
   content.
   
   Expected Results:
   Document level errors be handled so that the customer can report
   the problem to IBM Support and once they obtain the fix they
   could go back and reindex the failing content.
   
   
   Workaround
   ----------
   There is a tuning parameter that can help to reduce the impact
   of unrecognized email formats until a fix is available.
   Modify the constructors.xml file to change <batchSize> from 15
   to 1.
   Restart the CSS Servers after this change.
   This will cause the TASK_ERROR to fail only the single item that
   is unrecognized, allowing the other 14 items in that batch to be
   processed separately.
   The result will be less items will be left to be retried in
   IndexRequests queue.
