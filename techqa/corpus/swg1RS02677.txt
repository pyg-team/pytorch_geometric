APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When we perform a Copy/Paste operation from Excel to a DT in
   Rule Designer, ODM depends on the CSV Format, which makes no
   distinction between empty cells and merged cells.
   Accordingly, a choice had to be made in ODM code, and the
   decision we made was to favor the merged behavior since it is
   more common than empty cells (even though empty cells are not
   incorrect).
   However, the choice was different for the paste operation with
   the paste button in V8.6, and for customers who are using empty
   cells, and are migrating from V8.6 or earlier, this behavior
   can be confusing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Rule Designer when you perform a copy/paste operation from
   Excel to a decision table the behavior is different when using
   former version of ODM (before 8.7) and recent ones. On the old
   version empty cells were not merged whereas they are in the
   recent versions of ODM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There is a  property 'dt.pasteNoMerge' to set in eclipse.ini
   file.
   - When this property is true, no merging of condition cells is
   performed. Empty cells are handled as independent condtion
   cells.
