 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am having problems with PASW/IBM SPSS while running a Categorical Principal Components analysis within Optimal Scaling. I am able to define the analysis options including the scale and weights, but I run into trouble when I attempt to use the Save option. When I select Save and choose Save to the active dataset option under Transformed Variables then click Continue, I see one or more of the following errors: 

- spssengine has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience. 
- The exception unknown software exception (0x400000015) occurred in the application at location 0x00463e3b. Click on OK to terminate the program. 
- An unknown error has terminated communication with the processor. The PASW Statistics Processor is unavailable. 
- An unhandled win32 exception occurred in spssengine.exe [11844]. Just-In-Time debugging this exception failed with the following error: No installed debugger has Just-In-Time debugging enabled. In Visual Studio, Just-In-Time debugging can be enabled from Tools/Options/Debugging/Just-In-Time. Check the documentation index for 'Just-in-time debugging, errors' for more information. 

After this, the application is unavailable - states: PASW Statistics Processor is unavailable.
