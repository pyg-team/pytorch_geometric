   *                      KOBSTART or KMQSTART workspaces in      *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   A couple of e3270ui workspaces issue queries to the TEMS
   nodelist table. The e3270ui waits for the response from all
   MQ agents before sending the data for display. With an MQ
   agent that is responding slowly or unresponsive, there might
   be no data displayed in the workspaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The e3270ui workspaces are modified to add timeout parameters
   for queries to nodelist table. This avoids the no data
   condition with a slow or unresponsive agent.
