Title: IBM itnm commands slow to respond - United States

Text:
itnm_status itnm_stop itnm_start TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My itnm_stop/itnm_start/itnm_status commands run very slowly when showing the status of the daemons. 

CAUSE
This is generally an issue with DNS resolution of the ITNM server itself. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
It is easy to check to see if this is the problem. Simply use the IP Address of your server, then run the following command:


nslookup <ip address of server> 

 

for instance: 

 

nslookup 10.10.10.10 

 

If the command returns quickly, this is likely not the issue. However, if this command is slow, you have likely identified the root of your problem.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Resolving the issues really means fixing the nslookup command above. You will need to check your DNS configuration file(/etc/resolv.conf) and make sure that you have a DNS server configured. If no DNS server is configured, the OS will still wait for the timeout, so this will slow down processing. Once a DNS server is configured, check the nslookup response time again. If it fast, even if it fails to find the server, that is fine. Once you have a fast response on the nslookup command, the response of your itnm_ commands should increase significantly.
