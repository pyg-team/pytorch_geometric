** For related technotes about other OS X versions, refer to the Index of Supportability Q&A technotes for Notes and OS X and Windows (technote 1998488) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21998488] ** 

Q1. Does IBM Notes support Apple's macOS High Sierra (aka OS X 10.13)? 
Yes. As of October 25th, 2017 (30 days after High Sierra General Availability) IBM supports OS X 10.13. Please review known install issue covered under the Known Issues section of this document. 

IBM recommends applying the latest Fix Pack and Interim Fix available to benefit from the latest features and enhancements. 

As was announced in Q4 2015 in the following technical document, Notes 9.0.1 Mac 32-bit is not supported with newer Mac operating systems, including macOS High Sierra: Statement of Direction: Recommended client for Mac 64-bit is Notes 9.0.1 64-bit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21971524] 


Q2. Are there any install issues specific to APFS? 
Yes, there is an issue with install listed below that can occur on APFS file systems. Macs with SSD drives will be converted to APFS upon upgrading to OS X High Sierra; there is no option to prevent this. 

If Notes 9.0.1 64-bit is installed before the upgrade, things will be fine. However, the first attempt to install Notes on a clean machine with APFS after upgrading to macOS High Sierra can result in install failure with the below error message. The second install attempt will succeed. So to work around the issue, you must run the installer a second time. (SPR HPXGAR67YY) 
 * "File /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/MacOS/rcp/rcplauncher not found. Provisioning process failed to launch or was terminated before status could be determined."


To address this issue, an updated 9.0.1 Mac 64-bit installer is slipstreamed available as of 9 March 2018. See Q5 for details. 


Q3. What versions of Notes are supported on macOS High Sierra?  * More to come on supported Notes versions after testing and development completes in October.

 * IBM Client Application Access (ICAA) is also supported. ICAA for Mac 64-bit is a lightweight solution that helps clients who want to move to a browser-based interface for email (IBM SmartCloud Notes web, IBM Verse, or iNotes), while continuing to work with existing Notes and Domino applications on-premises.


Q4. I'm already at Notes 9.0.1 64-bit, where can I download 9.0.1 Interim Fix 14 or higher? 
See this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963] for a list of fixes and download links for Notes 9.0.1 64-bit Interim Fixes. 


Q5. Where can I download the latest IBM Notes 9.0.1 64-bit (revised March 2018) or the Mac 64-bit API Toolkit (released in 2015)? 

Notes 9.0.1 64-bit was released in 2015 and then revised on 9 March 2018 to address an OS X 10.13 install issue. It is available from IBM Passport Advantage Online [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm], Partner downloads, and in IBM Connections Cloud for SmartCloud Notes customers (see below table for more information) on availability and part #'s.
