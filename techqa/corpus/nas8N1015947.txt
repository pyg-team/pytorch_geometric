Title: IBM BRMS Maintenance or Sync Jobs Hangs When Using TCP/IP for BRMS Networking - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using TCP/IP for BRMS networking, users may experience hangs when running BRMS maintenance (STRMNTBRM) or find that systems are not being synchronized correctly because the QBRMSYNC job seems to be hanging. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When using TCP/IP for BRMS networking, users may experience hangs when running BRMS maintenance (STRMNTBRM) or find that systems are not being synchronized correctly because the QBRMSYNC job seem to be hanging. 

One reason for this is because, while the BRMS maintenance or QBRMSYNC job was running, a system in the BRMS network was ended to a restricted
state using the *IMMED option. This happens when a BRMS DDM operation is in progress or BRMS is trying to open a DDM file OPNDBF command when the target system is ended to a restricted state (ENDSBS *ALL). The DDM job on the local system will remain in a wait status as there is no time period when DDM is in receive mode.

To correct the problem, you should cancel the job and restart it (STRMNTBRM), cancel the job, and allow BRMS to re-sync the systems later when the target system is up (QBRMSYNC job). Or, do nothing, and wait for the target system to come out of restricted mode.
