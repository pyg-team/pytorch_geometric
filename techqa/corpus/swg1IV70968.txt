APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENV: TDWC 9.1 and 9.2
   PROBLEM: The "Manage Settings" panel for managing configured
   tasks and engine connections is not functional.
   * Neither radio button is pre-selected under "Import settings"
   * After selecting radio button "Use database as settings
   repository:" all fields are blank.
   * Entering values into the fields under "Database connection
   properties:" yields nothing when clicking the [Save] button.
   * The [Test Connection] button returns the following error:
    AWSUI6171E The operation could not be completed because the
   Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console server is unreachable. Possible
   causes are that the Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console server has
   been stopped or that your login authentication has expired or
   has become invalid.
   RECREATE: The behavior in the "Manage Settings" panel can be
   recreated by following the first step of "How to configure TDWC
   to use all authenticated portal user role"

   "1) Modify the configuration at Application Server Level:
   - edit this file (perform a backup copy before):
   ${JAZZSM_INST}JazzSM\profile\config\cells\JazzSMNode01Cell\appli
   cations\isc.ear\deployments\isc\TWSWebUI.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
   - locate this lines:
   <filter-mapping>
   <filter-name>TIPFilter</filter-name>
   <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
   </filter-mapping>
   - remove them and save the file
   ..."
   - restart the TDWC profile (with wastools, stopWas/startWas)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
