   Problem title:
   Comment lines causing stored procedure calls to fail
   .
   Problem description and Business Impact:
   Greetings,
   
   We are running data studio 4.1.1 with DB2 for zos v11. We have a
   situation where our developers are running stored procedure
   calls and
   they are failing when they are preceded with a comment line.
   For example if I run this:
   
   CALL DBE.GET_CAT_ENTRY('PDM Non-Prod Server',?,?,?);
   
   I get results at my shop, when I run this:
   
   --comment
   CALL DBE.GET_CAT_ENTRY('PDM Non-Prod Server',?,?,?);
   
   I get:
   
   --comment
   CALL DBE.GET_CAT_ENTRY('PDM Non-Prod Server',?,?,?)
   
   [jcc][10413][10940][4.18.60] Literal replacement parsing failed
   for
   procedure call to DB2 for z/OS. Failing SQL text --comment
   CALL DBE.GET_CAT_ENTRY('PDM Non-Prod Server',?,?,?).
   ERRORCODE=-4463,
   SQLSTATE=42601

PROBLEM SUMMARY
