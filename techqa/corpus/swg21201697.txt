QUESTION
 How do you create an IBM WebSphere Application Server profile and use it in Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software so that you can run projects on separate profiles during development? 

CAUSE
A WebSphere Application Server profile is created for the integrated WebSphere Test Environment when Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software is installed, and this default profile is used by all workspaces.

ANSWER
To create a server profile, follow these steps: 

 1. Invoke the WebSphere Application Server Profile Creation tool:
     * From the main menu select Window > Preferences 
     * Expand the Servers section and then select WebSphere  * In version 7.x a list of runtime environments are shown above. 
        * Select the runtime you want to create a profile for so that it is highlight
       
       
     * Version 6 and 7: Click the Create Profile button to launch the WebSphere profile creation tool 
     * Version 7.5: Click the Run Profile Management Tool button to launch the profile management tool
       
    
    
 2. Step through the profile creation wizard, paying attention to the following:
     * The ports selected are based on a simple incremental scheme. Ensure the selected ports are available on your machine and change them if necessary
       
     * For the best integration with Rational Application Developer, disable the option to configure the profile as a Windows service.
       
     * More information is located in the WebSphere Application Server information center, see "Related URLs" below.
    
    


To create a new server instance in Rational Application Developer to utilize this newly created profile, follow these steps: 
 1. From the main menu select File > New > Other > Server > Server and click Next.
    
 2. Select the appropriate server type and version and click Next.
    
 3. In the "WebSphere profile name" drop-down list, select the new server profile.
    
 4. Ensure that the applicable SOAP connector port generated in Step 6 from above is correctly specified.
    
 5. Click Finish


If the newly created profile is for an existing WebSphere Application Server instance in Rational Application Developer, then you can change the profile by way of the Server overview editor by following these steps: 
 1. If the server is running or there are any applications published:
     1. If there are any applications published to the server, you will need to first ensure that the server is running, and then remove the applications from the server. 
     2. Ensure that the server stops. If it is running, then stop the server.
        
    
    
 2. Right-click on the WebSphere Application Server instance and select Open.
    
 3. Expand the Servers section.
    
 4. Select the profile in the "WebSphere profile name" drop-down field and ensure that the correct SOAP connector port for this profile is specified.
    
 5. Exit the Server overview and save the changes.


You should now see the new server profile in the "Servers" view, and you can use it the same way as the original default profile.
