PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DataStage Designer client startup fails with repository access error: 

An error occurred retrieving the folder content for '\': Input string was not in a correct format.



The error typically only affects one user machine, not all users. 

CAUSE
The primary cause for this issue is that some regional settings for the client machine are set to values which cause a numeric parsing error when when the Advanced Find query used to build repository tree calls .NET.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open the Windows Regional settings dialog (Control Panel -> Regional and Language Options), ensure that the desired language such as English is selected, and then click the Customize button. 

This will display the Customize Regional Options dialog which contains several settings which can cause problems when not set correctly. 

If you are using U.S. English, confirm that "Decimal symbol" is set to the period character, and "Digit grouping symbol" is set to a comma. Also ensure that "Negative sign symbol" is set to a short dash character / minus sign.

Setting any of these values to other characters (like double quote, equal sign, etc) or multiple character strings have caused this error at other sites. 

After correcting any incorrect values click the Apply button on both dialogs, then start a new Designer client session and confirm it can now start up without the input string format error.
