 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-206, SQLSTATE=42703 when running CDT and comparing source and target environments 

SYMPTOM
You are running CDT tool and using Configuration Data Deployment option to compare source and target database. You are seeing the above mentioned error.


ENVIRONMENT
Sterling Order Management

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Error example:


 <Error ErrorCode="-206" ErrorDescription="DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-206, SQLSTATE=42703, SQLERRMC=YFS_USER.EXTN_USER_ACTIVE, DRIVER=3.62.56" ErrorRelatedMoreInfo=""> 

 

This error suggests database is missing EXTN_USER_ACTIVE column in YFS_USER table. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 You have extended source database but did not apply same extensions on target environment. CDT can not add extended column(s) to target database, CDT migrates its data. Please apply same extensions to your target environment (database) to resolve the problem. 

 

Note: At the moment, CDT does not migrate Shadow columns data. To populate Shadow columns please run YCPCaseInsensitiveDataLoaderAgent in the target environment.
