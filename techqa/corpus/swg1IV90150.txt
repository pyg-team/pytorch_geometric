APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNM v4.2 - GA & FP1.
   Even though 'itnmuser' does not have any ncp* roles (e.g.
   ncp_networkview), the user can still create NetworkViews. As a
   result, the ITNM Admin can not restrict users from creating
   Network Views.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Any customer wishing to create network view users who have   *
   * read only access                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The removal of the Web GUI permissions netcool_ro and        *
   * netcool_rw from the ITNM 4.2 code mean there is no way to    *
   * set a user as read-only for network views.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to ITNM 4.2.004 (FP4)                                *
   ****************************************************************
   Regression in 4.2 when compared with 3.9 and 4.1.1
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If a user is given ncp_networkview_readonly role they cannot
   create or edit views, but may merely open and view them.
