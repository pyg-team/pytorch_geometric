QUESTION
 You want to know the order in which the WebSphere MQ (WMQ) queue manager terminates the active channels when the queue manager is ending? 

ANSWER
The channels are stopped in the order in which they appear in the channel status table, which is an internal structure maintained by the queue manager.
If the queue manager has not been running very long this is likely to be the order in which the channels were started. 

However, since slots in the status table are reused when a channel stops and another starts, for a queue manager which has been running for an appreciable length of time, and has had channels starting and stopping, the channels are effectively in random order.
