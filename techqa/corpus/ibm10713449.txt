CVEID: CVE-2018-10549 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10549]
DESCRIPTION: PHP could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds read in exif_read_data in ext/exif/exif.c. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to mishandle the case of a MakerNote that lacks a final ''\0'' character and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/142564 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/142564] for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2018-10548 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10548]
DESCRIPTION: PHP is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in ext/ldap/ldap.c. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to mishandle the ldap_get_dn return value and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVEID:CVE-2018-10547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10547]
DESCRIPTION: PHP is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the ext/phar/phar_object.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using request data of a request for a .phar file to execute script in a victim''s Web browser within the security context of the hosting website, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVEID:CVE-2018-10546 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10546]
DESCRIPTION: PHP is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to reject invalid multibyte sequences by the iconv stream filter in ext/iconv/iconv.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
