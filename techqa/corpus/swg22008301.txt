QUESTION
 RDS PRO: Tenable Vuln. Plugin 85582 Web Application Potentially Vulnerable to Clickjacking - Middleware



Security Vulnerability



The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a

clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user

performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.



X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser vendors.



Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other

attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which sources can embed the protected resource.



Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through

automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive transactions. 

ANSWER
Connect:Direct Browser 1.5.0 does include x-frame option in the header as SAMEORIGIN which ensures the page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. And has since the earlier releases.
