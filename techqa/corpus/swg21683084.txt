Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My IBM SPSS Modeler 16 installation is not starting anymore, when I try to start it from the Start menu or by double-clicking to open an existing stream, I'm receiving the error: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError native memory exhausted


IBM SPSS Modeler 16 installed on a Windows 7 32-bit system.

The problem persist after having reinstalled Modeler. 

CAUSE
IBM SPSS Modeler max memory setting exceeds the limit for a 32-bit Java application.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem is that we are asking Modeler to assign memory that the 32-bit Java VM cannot handle. 

The 32-bit versions of Java has a hard limit of approx 1.5GB. 

In this scenario we were try to assign 1.8GB of RAM upon startup and it causes a Java exception.

Re-installing Modeler does not resolve this is because the installer focuses on the \Program Files and \ProgramData folders of Windows.

The uninstaller does not touch the \Users\<username>\AppData folders as the end-user can re-install and keep their customised settings for Modeler Client. This location is where the Maximum Memory settings is stored by IBM SPSS Modeler.

Setting the MaxMemoryMB on the system.prefs file to the default value of 512 solved the issue.
