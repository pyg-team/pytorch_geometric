ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During our UAT tests of WBI-FN we hit the following problem :
   
   CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSLNMQH  EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   After which we had 100s of the following BIP error messages
   
   BPXF024I (PSTOMVS) Nov 12 15:55:56 LMVS01 WMQIv210 16777297 :
   271 (BUL1BRK.DNF_FIN_EG01) 16 BIP2232E: Error detected whilst
   handling a previous error in node.... etc.
   
   During a test of 4000 msgs cde count for DSLNMQH increased by
   4694. EP address did not change (according to TMON). Private
   storage increased by +5804K. Module DSLNMQH is REentrant and

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSLNMQH     *
   *                      EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT.               *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The system generated maximum use count exceeds because
   the function did not free the module DSLNMQH.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DSLNICTM is changed to close the function to free the use count.
