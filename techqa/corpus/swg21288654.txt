PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Multiple container attributes are generated by the IBM WebSphere Adapter for Siebel Business Applications in the parent business object for a simple link relationship between two Siebel business components. 

CAUSE
The adapter generates multiple container attributes for a simple link relationship. For example, as part of the enterprise services discovery generation, if you select the Siebel business components Account and Business Address in the Siebel business object Account, the corresponding WebSphere business object generated for the Siebel business componentAccount includes three container attributes--BusinessAddress, BusinessAddress', BusinessAddress3--instead of one. You can confirm that SimpleLink application-specific information is set against the three container attributes.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Although the extra container attributes should not affect the transaction if they are left untouched, remove the unwanted attributes using the business object editor in WebSphere Integration Developer so that you have only one of the three attributes (BusinessAddress, BusinessAddress2, and BusinessAddress). Refer to the IBM Integration Designer knowledge center [https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiPpNL66uPPAhVKOo8KHe5FCOIQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fsupport%2Fknowledgecenter%2FSSTLXK_8.5.5%2Fcom.ibm.wbpm.wid.main.doc%2Fkc-welcome.html&usg=AFQjCNFOZQnLMqIuPpmA7fwEqjoDerQu8g&sig2=HZ0BK3fmwjLHwjUhLnLVDg] for details on using the business object editor.
