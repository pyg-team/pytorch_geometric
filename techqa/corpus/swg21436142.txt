QUESTION
 How do you configure purge settings for System Health agent messages in SiteProtector? 

ANSWER
Purging for System Health events, which show up in the agent messages tab with a type of Info Event, is configurable with the SQL statement that is referenced below. Other message types are removed when they are no longer valid.

Note: Items of type Application Artifact are not purgeable.

To change the purge settings from the default of 14 days to 30 days, execute the SQL statement below:

USE RealSecureDB
GO

UPDATE RSDBOptions
SET ParamValue = 30
WHERE OptionName = 'max health Info Events age'

Note: The value of 30 is used in this example, but it can be configured to a higher or lower value as needed by updating the SET ParamValue = 30 line to the desired age.
