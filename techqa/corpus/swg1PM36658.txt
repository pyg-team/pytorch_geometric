   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQ JMS client which uses CCSID 819      *
   *                      fails to connect to queue manager       *
   *                      running with CCSID 1399. Error messages *
   *                      CSQX541E and CSQX228E are reported by   *
   *                      the CHIN.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Queue manager rejects the client connection with error messages
   CSQX541E and CSQX228E generated by the CHIN.
   
   MQJMS client applications which use CCSID 819 to connect to
   queue managers running with CCSID 1399 that is a mixed CCSID
   with SBCS part and DBCS part. The SBCS part is CCSID 5123. Queue
   manager rejects the client connection because CCSIDs 819 and
   1399 are incompatible.
   
   A CHIN service parm (CHISERVP) can be used to allow the client
   connection using a conversion between 819 and 5123.
   
   Unfortunately, this also fails with error messages CSQX519E and
   CSQX599E because there is no conversion table for 819<-->5123
   loaded in MQ 701.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  New conversion table for 819<-->5123 has been loaded in MQ V701
   in module CSQA2000.
