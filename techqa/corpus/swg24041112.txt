INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 Installing interim fix probe on Netcool/OMNIbus V8.1.0 

The Netcool/OMNIbus 8 Plus Probe for SNMP Multiplatform zip file contains the necessary information and files required to install this product using IBM Installation Manager. 

The product can be installed in either one of two ways, both of which require the user to add a repository to the list of repositories in Installation Manager.




 1. Installation Manager can install a product using the zip file provided, without the need to unzip the file.
    
    
    
 2. Add the repository.config file found in the zip file.





Installing interim fix probe on Netcool/OMNIbus V7.4.0 All probes are upgraded for using the deployment engine (DE) which handles the installation process. Before the DE can install an interim fix with the same major version number of the probe, the older version of the probe must be uninstalled. For example, upgrading from GA version 1.20.0 to a interim fix version 1.20.2. 

Uninstalling probe is a complicated task and should only be attempted when necessary due to some of the following complications. 

 * The uninstall command will also remove any prerequisites that were installed with the probe. However, if the prerequisites were installed separately then the prerequisites must be removed separately. 
 * If a prerequisite is used by more than one probe, it will not uninstall.


To install an interim fix probe from a GA version on UNIX and Linux operating systems, use the following steps: 


 1. Ensure you are using the same user profile under which the DE is installed. The owner of the $OMNIHOME directory will also be the owner of the DE. Use the following command to display the$OMNIHOME owner: 
    
    cd $OMNIHOME ; ls -ltr
    
    
    
 2. Switch to this user profile using the command: 
    
    su -username
    
    
    
 3. Make a backup of any existing configuration files that you might already have for an earlier version of the probe and that you want to retain. For example; probe.props, probe.rules or probe.env. These files will usually be located in the following folder:
    
    $OMNIHOME/probes/arch
    
    
    
 4. Remove the probe using the uninstall command in the$NCHOME/_uninst/ directory: 
    
    $NCHOME/_uninst/probe/uninstall
    
    Where probe is the probe you wish to uninstall.
    
    Note: This command does not remove configuration files which were modified when configuring the probe. These configuration files must be manually removed.
    
    
    
 5. Remove the configuration files that you backed up in step 3.
    
    
    
 6. Install the updated probe using the installation package.
    
    The installation package contains the appropriate files for all supported versions of Netcool/OMNIbus. For details about how to install the probe to run with your version of Netcool/OMNIbus, visit the following page on the IBM Tivoli Information Center:

 2. Make a backup of any existing configuration files that you might already have for an earlier version of the probe and that you want to retain. For example; probe.props,probe.rules or probe.env. These files will usually be located in the following folder:
    
    %OMNIHOME%\probes\win32
    
    
    
 3. Remove the probe using the uninstall command in the %NCIHOME%\_uninst\ directory.
