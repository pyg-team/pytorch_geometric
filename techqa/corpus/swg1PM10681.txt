APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If timeout.resume.session=true is set, the session resume
   component does not correctly handle the requested navigation
   state from the current request.
   Failing scenario:
   - Set timeout.resume.session=true
   - Set persistent.session.level=2, persistent.session.option=0
   - Login to Portal
   - Navigate to Administration -> Enable Tracing
   - Wait until session timeout occurs
   - click on "Manage Pages"
   - Portal incorrectly renders either the Enable Tracing or the
   portal default page (Getting started)
   
   correct behavior would be that the request to navigate to
   "Manage Pages" is executed and the session is resumed
   transparently in portal.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Setting persistent.session.level=0 will not cause this failure
   to happen.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If timeout.resume.session=true is set, the session resume
   component does not correctly handle the requested navigation
   state from the current request.
   
   Failing scenario:
      - Set timeout.resume.session=true
      - Set persistent.session.level=2, persistent.session.option=0
      - Login to Portal
      - Navigate to Administration -> Enable Tracing
      - Wait until session timeout occurs
      - click on "Manage Pages"
      - Portal incorrectly renders either the Enable Tracing or the
   portal default page (getting started)
   
   Correct behavior would be that the request to navigate to
   "Manage Pages" is executed and the session is resumed
   transparently in portal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR corrects the request state handling during session
   resume.
