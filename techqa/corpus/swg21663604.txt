Title: IBM Decision Center prompts user to remember password - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I ensure that all Decision Center (Rule Team Server) users need to always enter their password to access the console? 

CAUSE
The feature provided by Decision Center is activated when checking the ‘remember my password’ option when signing in. The behavior is similar to that of most websites that provide such a feature: 

 * If you check the box to stay signed-in and later just close your browser, you do not need to enter your password again the next time you open the console. 
 * If you explicitly sign-out at any point, you need to enter your information (username+password) the next time. 
 * After a certain time without accessing the service, you are prompted to sign in again.


On the other hand, most web browsers provide an auto-completion feature that memorizes, if you agree, all the content entered in forms, including passwords in log-in pages. 

Either feature may be seen as a security liability depending on your Corporate security policy. 
ANSWER
You can disable the Decision Center feature by simply removing the "remembering my password" check box from the Decision Center login page. 

In V8.5, for example, remove the following tag from the "LoginFooter" in thelogin.jsp of the teamserver.war: 

 * 
 * <h:panelGrid columns="2" styleClass="center">
 *  <h:selectBooleanCheckbox id="persistAsCookieID" rendered="#{ManagerBean.allowCookiePersistence}" /> 
   <h:outputLabel for="persistAsCookieID" value="#{bundle.enterPersistAsCookie}" /> 
 * </h:panelGrid> 


 

You can disable the auto-completion feature provided by the web browsers: 

 * In the browser settings (see the corresponding browser documentation), 


or  * by adding the attribute "autocomplete="off"" to the "loginForm" form in the Decision Center login.jsp (see this Mozilla page [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/How_to_Turn_Off_Form_Autocompletion] for more information).


 

Neither change affects the other feature, so you need to disable both the Decision Center and browser features to ensure that your Decision Center users need to always enter their password to access the console.
