PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote identifies a defect where where attempts to run a portlet project on a local WebSphere® Portal 6.1 using the "Run as > Run on server..." option results in the process appearing to complete successfully; however, Rational® Application Developer does not create a page to hold the portlet. 

SYMPTOM
When running a portlet project on a local WebSphere Portal 6.1 using the "Run as > Run on server..." option, the process appears to complete successfully; however, Rational Application Developer does not create a page to hold the portlet, instead the browser is opened at the WebSphere Portal 6.1 Administration page, and the following message can be found in the Console view:

[8/7/08 14:05:30:581 EDT] 000000a3 SSLHandshakeE E SSLC0008E: Unable to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or security settings have expired. Exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown.

CAUSE
This is caused by a defect shipping in Rational Application Developer v7.0.0.7. 

The problem has been recorded in APAR PK67621 and is scheduled to ship in the next maintenance release of Rational Application Developer.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

WORKAROUND: 

The problem can be worked around by first running the "Deploy portlet..." command: 

 1. Right-click on the portlet project and select "Deploy Portlet..." 
 2. Select your local Portal 6.1 server and click Next. 
 3. On the next page, accept the default settings according as per the screenshot:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21318094&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21318094&aid=1]
    
 4. Click Finish. 
 5. The procedure will fail with the following message:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21318094&amp;aid=2]
    
 6. However, subsequent usage of the "Run as > Run on server..." functionality will succeed. 


Note: Closing Rational Application Developer will revert back to the original behaviour. These steps need to be followed once every time Rational Application Developer is started.
