Title: IBM SFTP or FTP poller front side handlers not finding files on remote server - United States

Text:
No input found for URL sftp ftp poller FSH handlers TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you use the SFTP or FTP poller front side handler on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance, the poller does not find the files on the remote server. 

SYMPTOM
The following is an example of a message found in the DataPower log for an SFTP poller that does not find files in the target directory:


 * 
 * No input found for URL 'sftp://XXX.XX.XXX.XXX:22/'


The X's represent the IP address of the remote SFTP server. Similar entries are found for FTP pollers with this issue. CAUSE
 

 * The poller's match pattern provided in the Input File Match Pattern field does not match the files provided in the Target Directory. 
 * The target directory provided in the poller's Target Directory field is not the correct directory. 
 * The server is not following the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) specification. For example, according to the specification, each file must have some permission bits set to indicate that this is a 'regular' file and not a directory or symlink; etc. If the server used does not correctly set these bits, the DataPower appliance cannot find the files even if the match pattern and target directory provided are correct..

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Ensure that the match pattern and target directory are correct. 
 2. Ensure that the server used follows the File Transfer Protocol specification. If it does not, switch to a server that follows the FTP specification.
