INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 Before you begin, make sure that you have performed a successful backup of your Rational Change databases. 

 1. Log in to the machine where Rational Change is installed as the user who installed Rational Change. 
 2. If you have customized any of the Rational Change attribute controls, after installing this iFix, you need to manually apply the customization.  * The attribute controls are at CHANGE_APP_HOME/WEB-INF/wsconfig/templates/pt/include/attr_controls. 
     * After the iFix is installed, you can refer to the old copy of the files backed up at CHANGE_APP_HOME/WEB-INF/packages/rc5.2.0.8.02/backup_<timestamp>
    
    
 3. Unzip (Windows) or untar (UNIX) the patch file into <CHANGE_APP_HOME>/WEB-INF/packages. The resultant directory will have the name "rc<patch version>".
    For example, on UNIX:
    $ cd <CHANGE_APP_HOME>/WEB-INF/packages
    $ tar xvf <file path> 
 4. Login to Rational Change as Admin, and click the "Administration" toolbar link. 
 5. You can now select this package from the "Package Installer" tab which will show it under "Available Packages" and click the "Install" button. 
 6. If Rational Change is running in the WAS or WASCE application server, restart the application server and ensure Rational Change is started. Otherwise, simply stop and start Rational Change. 
 7. If you are using the OSLC REST API (used to integrate with products such as Rational Publishing Engine and Rational Quality Manager) for the first time, stop and start Rational Change again to activate the API. 
 8. Stop and start Rational Change. 
 9. The process package needs to be regenerated and needs to be reinstalled.


Uninstalling the iFix: 

If it is necessary to remove this iFix after it was installed, follow these steps. 
 1. Login to Rational Change as Admin, and click the "Administration" link in the action panel. 
 2. Click on the "Package Installer" tab, select the patch package from the "Installed Packages" listbox, and click the "Uninstall" button.
