   The code the DRS is trying to replicate from WCM ( the object )
   com.ibm.workplace.wcm.app.ui.portlet.model.PortletModel is
   serializable. However it references the Credential Vault
   Service.  The referenced
   com.ibm.wps.sso.credentialvault.CredentialVaultServiceProvider
   is NOT Serializable and therefore results in the above
   exceptions.
