Title: IBM rsct.basic cannot be installed on AIX - United States

Text:
TSA; TSAMP; RSCT; AIX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The TSAMP installation log (/tmp/installSAM.1.log) shows the following error:
Error: Package rsct.basic cannot be installed on AIX because the installed version of other RSCT packages is higher: 3.1.2.0 

SYMPTOM
DB2 installer is getting this error message: 

Installing Tivoli SA MP 
ERROR: An error occurred while installing file set "tsamp". Correct the error or contact a technical service representative.


CAUSE
This is documented in the Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (TSAMP) Installation Guide :
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com.ibm.samp.doc_3.2.2/HALICG23.pdf [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com.ibm.samp.doc_3.2.2/HALICG23.pdf]

Please page 8. Basically you have existing RSCT filesets installed that are higher than the ones TSAMP needs to install. The problem exists because TSAMP needs to install RSCT filesets that you don't have installed yet, but it cannot do that since AIX does not allow mixed levels of filesets for a given component.


ENVIRONMENT
AIX only. Usually a problem if the client has latest TL level, so latest RSCT level, or if their TSAMP install version is old relative to the AIX TL installed.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The TSAMP Release Notes tell you what version of RSCT is bundled with each TSAMP version/fixpack, so you can predict in advance whether your server is going to have a problem by comparing to the version of RSCT filesets you already have installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The release notes suggest you manually install the missing RSCT filesets at the same level of the other RSCT filesets that you already have on your server. An easier resolution is to download and install the latest fixpack for TSAMP as it will likely contain a higher version of RSCT than you currently have installed, hence the TSAMP installer will be able to automatically install any RSCT filesets you don't currently have, while also upgrading the ones you do have. Here are the steps: 


Step A:
Download the latest "Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms" (TSAMP) fixpack via the following URL :
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039236 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039236]

Here is an example of the Fix Central links you will see for each supported OS ... choose the one for AIX :
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612887&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612887&aid=1]

Note: Do not choose a package containing “SAMPOC” in the name as this is not the TSAMP core product.


Step B:
Obtain the TSAMP v3.2 license file and copy into the TSAMP fixpack install media downloaded above.

Source the "sam32.lic" license file from the original DB2/TSAMP installation media, for example <db2_install_media>/server/db2/aix/tsamp/license

... else source the license file from the DB2 Activation Zip file that is available via your Passport Advantage account, eg “DB2_ESE_Auth_User_Activation_V97.zip”. This Activation zip file contains the “sam32.lic” file in the sub-directory "../ese_u/db2/license/"

Extract the TSAMP Fixpack that was downloaded from step A. A sub-directory named similar to “SAM3223MPAIX” will result ... obviously with different version number if you're using a fixpack different from v3.2.2.3 as used as an example within this document.

Copy the “sam32.lic” file into the directory :
/<local_media_dir>/SAM3223MPAIX/license

Step C:
Run the TSAMP installer from within the SAM3223MPAIX directory, as shown by the following example :
root@node01:# /share/SAM3223MPAIX/installSAM
installSAM: >>> Installation log appended : Thur Oct 6 11:07:43 EST 2011
…
installSAM: All packages were installed successfully.
installSAM: uninstallSAM for uninstallation is provided in directory:
installSAM: <<< Installation log ended : Thur Oct 6 11:09:01 EST 2011

Step D:
Repeat the install on the other node(s). Make sure you have copied the sam32.lic file into each install media if you're not using a shared space to hold the install media.
