ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OS Access Roles - After securing an object store via access
   roles, favorites in the OS are still available.
   OS Access Roles - cross object store Entry Template will allow
   doc to be added to restricted object store
   Case 1 Steps to repro:
   Determine bootstrap object store
   Edit bootstrap object store to allow only AE Admin access role
   to access the object store
   Create Entry Template to add a document to bootstrap object
   store, saving the ET in a different object store
   Sign in as  non-AE Admin user (for example "tester")
   use ET to add document
   Expected - error mesage stating no permission to add to object
   store
   Actual - document is added to the object store
   Case 2 Steps to repro:
   1. Sign in as "tester"
   2. Create a favorite in an object store (Dev2)
   3. sign in as suser (or other AE Admin)
   4. Assign an access role to the OS (Dev2) that does not allow
   Tester to see that OS (Site Preferences> Object
   Stores>Dev2>Object Store Access assign a role like application
   engine administrators)
   5. Sign in as tester, Note the OS no longer shows in the OS
   tree
   Expected result:
   Any favorites created for objects in the secured object store
   should no longer show/be accessible from favorites.
   Actual result:
   folder, search, template and document favorites in the access
   role secured object store still show in the favorites tree and
   list views.
