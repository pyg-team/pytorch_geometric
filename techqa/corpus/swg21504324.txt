QUESTION
 What is the procedure to determine which repository users are created in when adding a user in TIP? 

ANSWER
The federated repository option in TIP/eWAS supports multiple disparate user repositories (such as LDAP, the local file based, Objectserver, etc) acting as one virtual repository or "realm". While TIP can search all of the repositories in the realm for authentication, it only supports user creation in one repository. To determine which repository in the realm TIP can add user to, do the following: 

 1. Log into TIP as a user with administrator privileges (e.g. "tipadmin"). 
 2. Under the Security task, select Secure administration, applications, and infrastructure, and then click the "Federated Repositories" link. 
 3. Click the "Supported entity types" link to view the current configuration for the Group, PersonAccount, and OrgContainer entities. The default is the local file based repository. The entries for the local file base repository are:
    
    Entity Type Base entry for the default Relative Distinguished Name properties Group o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm cn OrgContainer o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm o;ou;dc;cn PersonAccount o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm uid 


You can change which repository TIP creates users in from this panel. For detailed instructions on changing " Supported entity types", review the Websphere document " Configuring supported entity types in a federated repository configuration [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.iseries.doc/ae/twim_entitytypes.html]"
