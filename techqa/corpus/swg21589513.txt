QUESTION
 How do I improve rule execution and RES performance when working with WebSphere Operational Decision Management or WebSphere ILOG JRules? 

ANSWER

The WebSphere Operational Decision Management documentation provides several guidelines for optimizing execution [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dserver.rulestudio%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2F_pubskel%2FInfocenter_Primary%2Fps_DS_Rule_Designer1376.html] and improving the performance of Rule Execution Server [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dserver.res%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2F_pubskel%2FInfocenter_Primary%2Fps_DS_Rule_Execution_Server1450.html]. You can refer to the documentation to optimize rules execution [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global764.html] and improve Rule Execution Server performance [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global204.html] for ILOG JRules v7.1.x and earlier. 

You can also incorporate the following recommendations, if applicable to your environment: 

Ruleset Design: 

 * Improve ruleflow execution performance [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400839]. 
 * Improve the time spent to execute a ruleset [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469115]. 
 * Avoid infinite loops [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432462] in rules. 
 * Reduce the memory footprint of the ruleset by setting the ruleset property ruleset.bom.enabled [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dserver.res%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2F_pubskel%2FInfocenter_Primary%2Fps_DS_RES_Console_OH1654.html] to "false [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dserver.res%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2F_pubskel%2FInfocenter_Primary%2Fps_DS_Rule_Execution_Server1564.html]" to remove support for BOM based serialization. This property is set to "true" by default when extracting rulesets from Rule Team Server (RTS) and Decision Center, and needs to be explicitly set to "false" in order to deactivate it. (You should set it to "true" if you need to generate an Excel report from a Test Suite/Simulation in RTS or Decision Center.)


Rule Execution Server (RES) Configuration:  * Size the engine pool [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400803] optimally in RES. 
 * Reduce the cost of ruleset parsing [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427266] during RES execution requests. 
 *  [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400763]Increase the size of the database connection pool for the RES data source. 
 * Estimate the database capacity [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430461] that should be allocated to RES. 
 * Reduce the amount of trace written to the server logs by fixing warnings and errors, and by adjusting the logging level (for example to =*info). This can significantly improve performance, especially in load testing and production environments.



The redpaper Proven Practices for Enhancing Performance: A Q&A for IBM WebSphere ILOG BRMS 7.1 [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4775.pdf] also contains detailed guidelines in the sections Enhancing the performance of Rule Execution Server and Enhancing the performance of the Rule Engine execution.
