APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Two devices with the same name, but different case, show as
   different devices with the same IP address. For example a device
   called "Arouter" and a device called "arouter" will be displayed
   correctly in the Network View, but each will have the same IP
   address.
   
   The default behaviour of MySQL is to make case insensitive table
   comparisons.  The change to the code is to make the comparisons
   sensitive to case.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The customer where this issue was observed, agreed to modifying
   the name as a workaround to the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users where two or more devices have names   *
   *                 that differ only in the case of the letters. *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two devices called Mahadthai and        *
   *                      MahadThai were being corrupted when     *
   *                      displayed in Topoviz.  They were        *
   *                      showing as two separate icons, but the  *
   *                      details were the same for both.  In the *
   *                      back end server processes, the two      *
   *                      devices had different details.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: It is best to avoid giving two different     *
   *                 devices names that only differ in by the     *
   *                 case of the letters.  (Since DNS is not case *
   *                 sensitive, this can only be done by using    *
   *                 sysName naming.)                             *
   ****************************************************************
   By default, MySQL does case insensitive string comparisons.
   This could lead to more data than expected being returned by
   queries that do string comparisons.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ncp_model_to_mysql has been altered to create tables using an
   option that tells MySQL to do case sensitive string
   comparisons.
