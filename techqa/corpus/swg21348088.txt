Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User clicks on 'Group - Data Entry - Group Journals'. User clicks 'printer' icon to print. User receives error message. 

SYMPTOM
 

Information
Standard Error
Number: 5
Source: mscorlib
Description: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
OK

TIP: The user may also have seen the following message the first time they tried to perform the print:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


CAUSE
The Controller application is trying to read the size of the paper/layout that the printer can print to. However, it has received an error. 

 
There are many potential causes for this, for example: 

 * Scenario#1 - There is no printer defined in Windows, for Controller to print to 
 * Scenario#2 - The user does not have permission to print to their Windows session's default printer

ENVIRONMENT
This problem could potentially occur inside any environment, but it is more likely to occur inside a heavily 'locked down' environment such as inside a Citrix session.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that: 

 1. There is a printer defined in Windows, for Controller to print to 
 2. The Windows user (running Controller) has permission to print to their Windows session's default printer 


TIP: If you are deploying Controller via Citrix (or Microsoft Terminal Services) then you will probably need the assistance of your Citrix administrator to help ensure that the user's Citrix session has a valid default printer defined, and that the permissions are correct.
