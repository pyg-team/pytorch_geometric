QUESTION
 What version of Apache, IBM® HTTP Server (IHS), or WebSphere® Application Server is used by the Rational® Web Platform (RWP) and CM Server? 

CAUSE
This technote clarifies: 

 * Which versions of Apache and Tomcat are used by RWP for 2003.06.13 through 2003.06.16. 
 * Which versions of IHS and WebSphere Application Server are used by RWP for 7.0.0.x and 7.0.1.x versions. 
 * Which versions of IHS and WebSphere Application Server are used by RWP and CM Server for 7.0.2.x and 7.1.0.x versions.

ANSWER
The Rational Web Platform for 2003.06.13 through 2003.06.16 uses: 

 *  Apache HTTP server version 2.0.40 Tomcat Servlet engine version 4.0.4 


The Rational Web Platform for 7.0.0.x and 7.0.1.x use :  *  IBM HTTP Server 6.0.2.x, which uses a core Apache version of 2.0.47 WebSphere Application Server Embedded Express version 6.0.2.x (replaces the Tomcat servlet engine from Rational 2003 versions) 


The Rational Web Platform and CM Server for 7.0.2.x and 7.1.0.x use:  *  IBM HTTP Server 6.1.0.x, which uses a core Apache version of 2.0.47 WebSphere Application Server Express 6.1.0.x 






For RWP 7.0.0.x and 7.0.1.x, the exact version of the IHS install can be verified by running the command " Apache.exe -V/apachectl -V " from the following directories (default install path): 

Microsoft Windows 
C:\Program Files\Rational\Common\rwp\IHS\bin Linux and UNIX
/opt/rational/common/rwp/IHS/bin 






For RWP and CM Server 7.0.2.x and 7.1.0.x, run the same command, only in the following directories (default install path):

Microsoft Windows
C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS\bin 

Linux and UNIX
/opt/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS/bin
