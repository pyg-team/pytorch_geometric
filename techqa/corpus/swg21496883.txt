Title: IBM Content Based Retrieval search with both custom property and document content fails - United States

Text:
Workplace XT search; Combined property and content search TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A CBR search using FileNet Workplace XT for both document properties and document content does not find any documents. 

SYMPTOM
A Content Based Retrieval search using FileNet Workplace XT for both document properties and document content using Workplace XT fails to bring back results.


CAUSE
This is working as designed. Since the Verity AND operator requires that the operands of the AND be in the same row, searching for “word1 AND word2”, where “word1” is in a content element and “word2” is in the properties, will not find a match.

ENVIRONMENT
N/A

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Works as designed per the following InfoCenter link




http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.p8.doc/developer_help/content_engine_api/guide/query_sql_syntax_ref.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.p8.doc/developer_help/content_engine_api/guide/query_sql_syntax_ref.htm] 

“The full-text index contains one row for each content element that is indexable, plus one more row for all CBR-enabled strings of an object. These rows can be returned for any content search. Since a single full-text query can find matches on multiple content elements or properties of a single Content Engine document, multiple rows for a single document can be returned from a search. 

Since the Verity AND operator requires that the operands of the AND be in the same row, searching for “word1 AND word2”, where “word1” is in a content element and “word2” is in the properties, will not find a match. Likewise, if “word1” is in content element 1 and “word2” is in content element 2 of the same document, the search will not find a match.”
