   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   After a B37-04 ABEND on the LOWORK file OMEGAMON Batch Locking
   Report continues to issue FPEL0750S messages filling JES spool.
   Code does not quit from the processing loop in case when write
   to LOWORK failed. That caused processing loop with FPEL0750S msg
   to occur when default LOWORK allocation parameters were not
   sufficient to accomodate all locking records.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   Code changed to fix this problem.
   
   KEYWORDS:
   BATCH LOCKING REPORT ABENDB37 LOWORK FPEL0750S LOOP
   
   CIRCUMVENTION:
   Increase LOWORK allocation parameters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code changed to fix this problem.
   
   KEYWORDS:
   BATCH LOCKING REPORT ABENDB37 LOWORK FPEL0750S LOOP
   
   CIRCUMVENTION:
   Increase LOWORK allocation parameters.
