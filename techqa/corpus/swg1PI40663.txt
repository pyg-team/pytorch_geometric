APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running a complex report based on a dynamic query mode
   package against DB2, a SQL syntax exception is thrown:
   
   XQE-DAT-0001 Data source adapter error: com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.
   SqlSyntaxErrorException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-104,
   SQLSTATE=42601,
   SQLERRMC=DESCFOR;
   
   The SQLERRMC part of the error may vary slightly - the issue is
   caused by a missing space before the last FOR FETCH ONLY clause
   in the SQL query.  In this example, the last keyword before the
   FOR FETCH ONLY clause was the DESC keyword from an ORDER BY
   clause, resulting in the invalid keyword DESCFOR.
