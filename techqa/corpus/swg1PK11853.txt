APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user is testing a website with Microsoft(R) Internet
   Explorer(R) 6.0 on Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Service Pack 2.
   The 'Allow active content to run in files on My Computer'
   setting is unchecked in Internet Explorer (IE), which causes the
   Information bar to appear in IE (to find the setting, click on
   Tools > Internet Options, click the Advanced tab and then scroll
   down to the Security section). Unfortunately, scripts cannot
   playback sucessfully when the Information bar appears.
   The problem does not occur if the 'Allow active content' setting
   is checked.  The problem can also be avoided while recording if
   the user closes the information bar before proceeding to the
   next recorded action.
   The problem is known to occur in IBM(R) Rational(R) Functional
   Tester v. 6.1.0.1 and v. 6.1.1.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the IE Information Bar is displayed, all HTML objects
   on th
   e page are shifted down by the height of the
   information bar.  T
   his was causing RFT to calculate the
   wrong position for the HTML
    objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  RFT was modified to take the height of the IE Information
   Bar into consideration when calculating the position of HTML
   objects in Internet Explorer.
