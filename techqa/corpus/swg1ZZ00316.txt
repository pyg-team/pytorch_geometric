ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While running a region server upgrade in the ICO 2.4 upgrade
   procedure, you face a failure in the deployment server job-list.
   
   RTPzVMRegion_9_37_32_101_Upgrade       |  ERROR
   
   You check the associated
   ds-dcf89b09-06be-449a-b695-40a4ab1f32c2.log file but it only
   shows us:
   [2014-11-11 10:43:46,127] 9.37.32.119 [31mError executing action
   ´upgrade´ on resource 'package[openstack-nova-compute]'
   
   So we know that the 'openstack-nova-compute' package failed to
   upgrade but we have no clear evidence why.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Try to run the command on the region server directly and find
   out why it fails:
   # yum install openstack-nova-compute
   In this case, yum returned a package 'gnutls' that was of a
   newer version on the region server and therefore package
   dependency could not be met.  Remove 'gnutls' package and try
   the yum install again.  You may find it now works, or, another
   package dependency issue must be handled.  Once the yum install
   command is successful, run the region upgrade job again to
   continue.  Use '-f=True' syntax when starting the region
   upgrade again.  eg like,
   ds job-execute -f=True dcf89b09-06be-449a-b695-40a4ab1f32c2
