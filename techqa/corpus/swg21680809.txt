Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM BPM document attachment queries can return document properties that contain sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-4759 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-4759]
DESCRIPTION: 
An Ajax service that is shipped with the Content Management toolkit allows users to search for IBM BPM document attachments from the Document List coach control. The service can be invoked by authenticated users and accepts any document query as input. Users might invoke the service with a query that returns all documents including associated document properties. 

Note: Listing all available documents is a valid usage scenario for the service. Access to document content is restricted so that only users that are authorized to work with a process instance can view contents of documents that are attached to this process instance. However, customers might store sensitive information in document properties. Therefore, customer-defined document properties must not be returned by the default search service.
