PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 No Application Servers message shows up in the TEPS console, the expandable "+" sign also does not show up. 

SYMPTOM
No expandable "+" sign shows up in the TEPS console for the WAS agent and a message "No Application Servers" appears on the panel.


CAUSE
This could be caused due to the wrong IP address in the com.ibm.tivoli.kwj.agenthostname parameter in the kwjdc.properties file.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you already have installed application support correctly, and if the agent still doesn't show up, then the IP address for the agenthostname parm might be incorrect.


Do a netstat -an | grep 63335 (Unix) or netstat -an | findstr 63335 (Windows) and see what IP address the TEMA is listening on. 

If you see 0:::6335 in the output you can use 127.0.0.1 or any address in the agenthostname parm and the agent will connect. If you see an IP address in the netstat output, then you have to use that IP address in the agenthostname parm field. 

This agenthostname parm is in the $DC_HOME/<runtime>/<server>/kwjdc.properties file. Simply open the file and look for the first parameter com.ibm.tivoli.kwj.agenthostname and edit it if needed. to the IP address being used. Save the file and restart the agent if changes to the file are made.
