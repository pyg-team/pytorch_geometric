QUESTION
A standard Times New Roman font is a different size in IBM Forms Viewer and Designer. Why does this size difference occur?

ANSWER
In order for the Viewer to display the font the same as the Designer, the monitor DPI (dots per inch) needs to be set to 120 DPI for the font sizes specified in the table below. To explain why the DPI needs to be set to 120, we explain how programmers code the pixel heights. 

When setting the pixel height, the programmer knows that one point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. So the programmer would use a formula to figure out how many pixels high to draw a font. For example: Pixel height = Point size * DPI of machine / 72 

Unfortunately, this value would display a different pixel height on different machines if they do not have the same DPI. The Viewer font calculations were standardized using 120 DPI. As a result, it converts the point size as follows: 
Pixel height = Point size * 120 / 72 

The Designer does not have the same control over the pixel height of the Viewer; therefore, for some font sizes there is a difference in height of 1 pixel. 

List of the affected font sizes up to 100 point are as shown in this table:



Font Point Size Designer Pixel Height Viewer Pixel Height 1 1 2 6 9 10 11 17 18 13 21 22 18 29 30 23 37 38 25 41 42 30 49 50 35 57 58 37 61 62 42 69 70 47 77 78 49 81 82 54 89 90 59 97 90 61 101 102 66 109 110 71 117 118 73 121 122 78 129 130 83 137 138 85 141 142 90 149 150 95 157 158 97 161 162 
As a result, to view the font correctly in the Designer and the Viewer, you should set the DPI to 120. To set the DPI, do the following: 

1. Right-click the Windows Desktop, and select Properties 
2. Select the Settings tab 
3. Click the Advanced button 
4. On the General tab, change the DIP setting to "Large size (120 DPI)"

The IBM Forms architects are reviewing the possibility of standardizing the fonts for 96 DPI.
