PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You might get this error, when you start VU recording against Internet Explorer in IBM Rational Robot. This technote contains possible causes and proposes a solution. 

SYMPTOM
The full error message is as follows: 

 * 
   The application (C:\PROGRAM FILES\INTERNET EXPLORER\IEXPLORE.EXE) experienced a fatal application error
   Code: C0000005 (ACCESS_VIOLATION)
   Addr: 5CB7778D
   Flags: 0000000
   




CAUSE
The Microsoft error message is generic. An Access Violation can have different causes. 

 

 *  The virus scanner causes problems. Windows Data Execution Prevention (DEP) prevents execution of rtalo.exe. When you record against Internet Explorer 6, Robot fails to start Internet Explorer. This is because of with a newer version of C:\Windows\AppPatch\aclayers.dll (version 5.1.2600.3647) on the Windows system. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In this case of cause "C", the recording stopped working after the Microsoft Update KB955759. 

Its release date was 7 December 2009. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Consider the following procedure. 

 

 1. If VU recording did work before 7 December 2009, verify if this Microsoft Update KB955759 is on your Windows system.
    
    If so, uninstall the KB955759 update through the Control Panel of Add/Remove Programs. Then restart the computer. 
 2. Verify if rtalo.exe is on the list of DEP exceptions. 
 3. Switch off your virus scanner before you record.



The following steps describe how to verify, if rtalo.exe in on the list of DEP exceptions. 

 

 1. Right click My Computer and click Properties > Advanced. 
 2. Click Settings in the Performance section. 
 3. In the Performance Options dialog box, click the Data Execution Prevention tab. 
 4. Click the option Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select. 
 5. Optional: click the Add button. Then in the Open File dialog box browse to rtalo.exe. 
 6. Then click Open. 
 7. Apply changes and restart the operating system.



Notes  * The default location of rtalo.exe is 
   
   C:\Program Files\Rational\Rational Test
   
   
 * Sometimes there is an error at the end of the recording, when Internet Explorer closes. You can safely ignore the error, because the error does not affect the actual recorded script.
