APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is no way to alter the timeout value of SSL sessions held
   by the HTTPSConnector.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The timeout can be configured via a java system property,
   but there is currently no way to set it via a WMB property.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the WebSphere Message Broker v6.1 or higher,
   HTTPInput and SOAPInput nodes.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   One of the facilities provided by the JVM security layer is to
   provide an SSLSession timeout. The Message Broker provides no
   way to override this setting resulting in all sessions
   having the default session timeout of 24 hours (86400 seconds).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to add an additional
   property to the HTTPSConnector named 'sslSessionTimeout' which
   can be set via mqsichangeproperties or using WebSphere Message
   Broker Explorer.  This value when set is passed down to the
   Java security layer.
   
   Changes to this parameter require an execution group restart in
   order to take effect.
   
   An example command to set an sslSessionTimeout of 1 hour (3600
   seconds) is:
   
   mqsichangeproperties <broker> -e <EG> -o HTTPSConnector -n
   sslSessionTimeout -v 36000

   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:
   
   V6.1 - Maintenance Level 6.1.0.10
