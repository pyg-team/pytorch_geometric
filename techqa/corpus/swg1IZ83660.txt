ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***Overview
   
   Setting up a display option on a resultset portlet causes the
   conditional attribute to be outputed to the maximo logger,
   appears to be no way of switching it off.
   
   
   ***Steps to Reprod
   
   1. setup a resultset portlet on SR, created a simple saved query
   and setup the display option condition on STATUS.
   
   2. Switch all loggers only to ERROR. When logging into Maximo it
   displays.

   532807680 and the memory available is 389419624.
   
   STATUS
   
   
   3. Remove the startcenter result portlet to see if logon the
   message will not be displayed
   
   Result: STATUS didn't display,So appears result portlet is
   producing the output.
   
   
   4. Then setup a new statcenter result portlet but the display
   option was set on OWNER. When logging in and out of Maximo OWNER
   would be outputed.

   Client wants a way to switch this off, escalated to L3 they
   asked me to create a APAR.
   ______________________________________________
   
   Further investigating
   
   5. I updated via backend, to mark all loggers as inactive, and
   then updated logger properties via logging application, but
   still received the message as to display options.
   
   I removed the internal logger called RSCONFIG, which I found
   couldn't be deleted via frontend end.
   
   
   
   The cause could be some other logger, I also feel a few
   enhancements (FITS) are needed for logging application.
   
   1. Action to globally switch off all loggers, and return it to
   the base level.
   
   2. Ability to make loggers inactive via the GUI, doesn't appear
   possible.
   
   3. Message key in logger output so the logger causing the output
   can be identified more easierly as to which logger is producing
   the output.

   Developer response (KD Singh Arneja):-
   
   If you were able to create the issue and turning off logging did
   not help then please take an APAR.
   
   my reply:
   
   I add a APAR but also was after if this was something
   configurable and something which could be switched off.
   
   Developer:
   
   No, the only thing configurable is the logger which they have
   tried.
