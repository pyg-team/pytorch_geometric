ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   - Find a Maximo 7.6.0.x environment and  install the Japanese
   language pack on this environment.
   
   Test on English 7.6.0.x environment first of all:
   - Log in to Maximo using the English language.
   - Open Work Order Tracking application
   - On Actions menu on left, click on "Create Report" option
   - The Query-Based report window opens up
   - On first tab, leave 'List' selected
   - Click on the Summarize tab
   - Filter by WOPRIORITY and then click on that field to bring it
   in box below
   - Click on the "Average" button
   - Click on 'Add Values' button
   - That field and its calculation "Average (WOPriority)" now
   shows in the Summaries table.
   - Click on the Preview button.
   - The report opens in a new browser window.
   - "Average (WOPriority)" and its value shows above the list of
   records in the report.
   
   Then test the issue again using a Japanese 7.6.0.x environment:
   - Log in using the Japanese language on login screen
   - Open Work Order Tracking application (icon for WO)
   - On left menu , click on "Create Report" option (using icon to
   find it)
   - on Query-Based report window, leave 'List' selected
   - Click on the 'Summarize' tab (4th tab from the left)
   - Filter by WOPRIORITY and then click on that field to bring it
   below
   - Click on the "Average" button (3rd button from left)
   - Click on 'Add Values' button (on right)
   - That field should show in the Summaries table but you get the
   following error instead:
   "BMXAA9031E: The data type for the selected field is not
   compatible with the selected function. Select another data type
   or function"
   - The report cannot be run unless you click on "Clear Values"
   in the Summarize tab.
