ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you create at least one new alert in the Alert Manager
   widget, then log out of Business Space (or WebSphere Portal) and
   log back in under a different user name using the same web
   browser window, then once again create at least one new alert in
   the Alert Manager widget, the owner assigned to the alerts you
   create in this session will be the user under which you were
   logged in during the first session, not the user under which you
   are currently logged in.  This behavior does not occur if you
   close the browser window after logging out of the first session
   and then open a new browser window to initiate the second
   session.
   
   Here is an example of the failing scenario:
   
   1. Open a web browser.
   2. Log into Business Space as user 'user1'.
   3. Open a page containing an Alert Manager widget.
   4. Click "New Alert" and create a new alert.  The owner will be
   'user1'.
   5. Log out of Business Space.
   6. Log back into Business Space (with the same browser window),
   as user 'user2'.
   7. Open a page containing an Alert Manager widget.
   8. Click "New Alert" and create a new alert.  The owner will be
   'user1' instead of 'user2'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After creating alerts in the Alert Manager widget and logging
   out of Business Space or WebSphere Portal, close the web browser
   and open a new one to log in as a different user.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This problem exists in WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0.
   It will be resolved in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0 Fix Pack
