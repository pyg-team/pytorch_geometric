ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A MIME message created with Notes client 8.5 FP1 generates HTML
   which cannot be displayed with the embedded browser in any
   client version up to 8.5.3FP3. Have tested also with the latest
   beta code and still cannot display. The body appears as blank.
   
   There have been numerous similar defects opened but I could not
   find a match similar to this, particularly, where the message
   is generated by Notes.
   
   A sample database is provided with 2 messages.
   Message 1: This is the original message provided by the
   customer and cannot be displayed with the embedded browser.
   Message 2: I copied the MIME source from the original message
   and sent it via telnet to a test user on my server. This
   message displays OK in the embedded browser.
   
   Other steps:
   1. Tried using BrowserRenderNoFilter=1 with no success.
   2. Copied the HTML content from the message into a HTML file.
   Created a  new message and inserte the HTML file as a
   signature. Sent to a test user. Message displays OK.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable embedded browser. Not an option for the customer.
