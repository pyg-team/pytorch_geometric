LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  As part of the normal operation of the Java runtime, some data
   structures may temporarily be put into a state where they can't
   be walked using the standard debugging routines.
   If a system dump is taken during one of these windows, the
   introspection routines in jextract will be unable to extract the
   data it would normally be able to.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR9
   .
   Jextract has been modified to cope with unwalkable structures.
   Inconsistencies in the dump will be recorded in the XML metadata
   log but not printed to the screen. In this way we will get an
   accurate picture of the dump but the screen will not be filled
   with error messages that don't necessarily indicate an error
   condition (just that certain structures in the dump are not in a
   walkable state).
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20081016 or later
