APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a Problem Management Report (PMR) ticket has been opened
   by the Call Home function it then tries to upload logs and files
   to the PMR system. The upload function will retry automatically.
   
   - The upload status should not be changed to the failed status
     until each retry has failed.
   
     Errors seen are:
     CWZIP3530E The Call Home request failed while attempting to
     upload a file to service ticket xx,yy,zz.
   
     CWZIP3538E The file did not upload in the allotted X seconds.
   
   - Files vanish from the PMR ticket after 5 failed upload
     retries.
   
     Error seen are:
     CWZIP3530E The Call Home request failed while attempting to
     upload a file to service ticket xx,yy,zz
   
     followed by a message:
     CWZIP3529E The Call Home request failed while attempting to
       add a note to service ticket xx,yy,zz.
     ECC Exception error received: WSWS3713E:
       Connection to the remote host [host_ip] failed
   
   - The CWZIP3530E error event should have a resolution clearing
     event if the upload retry is successful
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The files can be manually uploaded to the Enhanced Customer Data
   Repository (EcuRep) using the PMR number.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The PureApplication System Call Home function had multiple
   problems when handling the problem document upload retries,
   generating the upload retry events, upload failure events and
   did not generate an event if the situation corrected itself.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is being provided in PureApplication System V 2.0.0.1 to
   only fail after the 5 retries, to generate a resolution event if
   one of the upload retries succeeds, and to not delete ticket
   documents after an upload failure.
