APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  usingKeys EGL documentation needs to be corrected.
   The usingKeys is used to override the list of key items specifie
   d for the SQL record.  The EGL documentation needs to be updated
    to clarify how the usingKeys clause is used and the effect of k
   ey items on implicit SQL statements.
   
   
   
   The usingKeys documentation currently states:
   
   
   
   Identifies a list of key items that are used to build the key-va
   lue
   component of the WHERE clause in an implicit SQL statement.  If
   you do
   not specify a usingKeys clause, the key-value component of the
   
   implicit statement is based on the SQL record part that is refer
   enced
   in the open or get statement.
   
   
   
   The documentation should be changed to contain the following
   
   information:
   
   
   
   The usingKeys clause identifies a list of key items that overrid
   e the
   keyItems defined for the SQL record.  If you do not specify a
   
   usingKeys clause, the key items list for the implicit statement
   is
   based on the keyItems list specified for the SQL record that is
   
   referenced in the open or get statement.
   
   
   
   Effect of key items on implicit SQL statements
   
   
   
   - For the Add statement, key items have no effect on the implici
   t SQL
     statement.
   
   
   
   - For the Get statement,
   
     - the key items are used to build the key-value component of t
   he
       WHERE clause.
   
     - if the forUpdate keyword is specified, the columns associate
   d
       with the key items are excluded from the columns listed on t
   he
       FOR UPDATE OF clause.
   
   
   
   - For the OPEN statement,
   
     - the key items are used to build the key-value component of t
   he
       WHERE clause.
   
     - if the forUpdate keyword is specified, the columns associate
   d with
       the key items are excluded from the columns listed on the FO
   R
       UPDATE OF clause.
   
     - if the forUpdate keyword is NOT specified,  only the columns
   
       associated with the key items are included in the list of co
   lumns
       on ORDER BY clause.
   
   
   
   - For the replace statement, the key items are excluded from the
    list
     of columns updated on the SET clause.
   
   
   
   Since the effect of key items list also applies to the SQL recor
   d's
   keyItems property, it should be referenced from the keyItems doc
   .
   UsingKeys info should also be referenced from from the keyItems
   doc to
   let users know they can override the record's keyItems property
   by
   specifying usingKeys on the get and open statements.
