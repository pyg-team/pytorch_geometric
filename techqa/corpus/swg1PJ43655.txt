ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using IBM Content Collector (ICC) for indexing through CSS,
   the following issues occur with specified file types:
   
           XPS   Sent to zip parser instead of OIT as they should
   be
          PSD  Add PSD files to unsupported list to handle like
   other image files
          ZIP    Failed handling ZIP file "Attachments.zip"
                   When trying to handle the ZIP file, we are
   getting the following errors:
   
   de.schlichtherle.io.ArchiveController$ArchiveEntryNotFoundExcept
   ion: <file name> (no such file entry)

           XLSX  Certain XLSX files fail textExtraction despite
   being readable in Excel
           XLSX  Not being sent for extraction to OIT and they
   should be
   
   
      Actual Results:
        XPS files are zip files ( like open office) and the files
   parsed by the Zip parser instead of OIT parser
        PSD They are currently being indexed with an empty content.
        XLSX Fail to extract when they should be extracted and
   indexed
        ZIP files are not being processed correctly, or do not
   produce the expected result.
   
      Expected Results:
        The file types are expected to be supported and processed
   correctly.
         XPS    files are zip files ( like open office) to be
   parsed by OIT parser
         PSD:  When processed will correctly produce the following
   error:
             *** Error parsing document!!! , Error level -
   IQQP0008W Unable to index document TestFromimp because the
   binary filter was not found or the MIME type
   [image/vnd.adobe.photoshop] is unsupported.
        ZIP: Correctly processed by new TrueZip version (7.7.9)
   instead of prior version (6.8.1)
        XLSX  Successful extraction and indexing of document
