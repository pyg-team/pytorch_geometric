ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   
   We have recommended IFixes instruction published  8 months ago
   for BPM 7.5.1 at the time GA which include about 19 Ifixes (
   including WAS IFixes) .
        http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023411 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023411]
   
   -- FixCentral  has options for customers to check on the
      recommended IFixes  which display 4 IFixes
    -  The FixcCentral does not list the IFixes recommended  Ifixes
        listed  in the original 7.5.1 GA technote
    -  The FixCentral  recommended IFixes require Pre-req IFixes
       which are not listed as recommended
       one of the IFix superseed another APAR listed as recommended
       and can not be installed together ..
   
   
   There is no update to the recommended IFix . Customers run into
   problems for known issues that could be prevented if they had
   certain interim fixes installed.  With certain BPM APARs,
   without an existing interim fix, a customer may end up with a
   corrupted environment, which then becomes a costly issue for
   both the customer and support to either manually recover or to
   reinstall.  If they had the fix beforehand this could have been
   avoided.
   
   Proposal:
   ----------
   Productively and periodically upload highly pervasive
   "Recommended" Interim Fixes to the Installation Manager online
   repository profile for WPS and BPM.
   
   Due to the fact that our Fix Packs are intermittent, there are
   well-known interim fixes that would be useful to customers.  If
   they are made more aware of these fixes which they install, they
   can avoid rediscovery of same problems. Having these in the
   online repository will better inform customers in a proactive
   "push" mechanism.
   In a nutshell, this is similar to the strategy used by Microsoft
   Windows Update, Anti-virus updates, or ISSI.
   
   We currently do not have a process in place to do this or
   leverage this functionality.
   
   
   Details:
   Only a small subset of fixes will be chosen to be in the online
   repository.   Appropriate disclaimer should be given or
   documented
   
   The timeframe and process on how the fixes are chosen are up for
   discussion, but it should be a periodic process to choose the
   fixes to upload.  It is suggested perhaps monthly or other
   meaningful timeframe.
   
   It is not expected or required that all customers will install
   the interim fixes chosed, especially on production or those that
   do not connect to the online repository.  However, a % of
   customers will install the fixes, which will trickle down to
   avoid some % of PMRs.
   At a minimum, they will be made more aware of these
   "recommended" development machines or new installs; where they
   can then investigate or consider.
   
   The fixes to be uploaded should be official fixes, perhaps at a
   period of time after it has been tested by the first customer
   for which the fix was developed.  It is not expected these will
   be pushed online immediately after they are developed
   
   Testing:
   --------
   If this plan is established, then the versions IBM "recommends"
   becomes a more periodic evolving platform compared to the very
   intermittent Fix Pack releases.  Test Team should also be more
   agile and update their test system to reflect this
   recommendation.
   
   Example:  If  2months after a fix pack, we "recommend" 3 very
   important ifixes and upload these to online repository.   From
   this point on, test team should use 7.0.0.5+3ifixes as the basis
   for testing subsequent fixes.
   
   This test will then better reflects what we recommend as well as
   better reflect the versions that customers should be using.  It
   may help find more problems that only occur to combinations of
   fixes.  Without this adjustment, Testteam maybe wasting their
   time testing fixes on the stock platform that very few customers
   are using in practice.
   
   
   
   Benefits:
   -----------
   Reduced PMRs and customer pain from rediscovery of known issues.
   Installing IFixes before profile creation  avoid  major steps in
   profile upgrade and database upgrade
   
   Greater testing/usage of important Interim fixes by customers.
   While this may seem like a negative, it may help avoid
   complications and regressions when the fixes are eventually
   rolled together into a fix pack.
   
   Costs:
   Periodic process and review needs to be put into place to choose
   the fixes to upload
   Unknown details about exactly who identifies the fixes to and
   who uploads the fixes.
   
   Complications/roadblocks to resolve and discussion of how to
   solve:
   If a bad fix is delivered, it will affect more customers
   Having the Installation Manger be the vehicle to deliver the fix
   to more customers does not make this worse or better.  If the
   first customer or PAT did not find the regression after some
   time, then the regression just stays hidden.   It is better that
   a slightly larger test group tested it and finds the regression
   faster and have the PE fix pushed out using the same mechanism.
   Eventually if the regression is not found, the fixes would be
   rolled up to a FixPack, and not having found the regression
   until that point is much worse.
