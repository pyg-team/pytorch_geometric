APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TDI Documentation for WASService command is incorrect.
   
   Description:
    Approximately 20 seconds after starting the Services in Windows
    Service, the status of the service is lost in Windows Services.
   The
    AMC server will remain active and listening for incoming
   browser
    connections, although Windows Service has no connection or
   control of
    the running AMC Server process.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   
    1. Create the service by following TDI Instructions for the
   WASService
      command:
   
      <TDI>\AppServer\bin>WASService.exe -add "TDIAMC" -servername
      server1 -profilePath "..\profiles\amcprofile" -startType
   automatic
   
      Adding Service: TDIAMC
           Config Root: ..\profiles\amcprofile\config
           Server Name: server1
           Profile Path: ..\profiles\amcprofile
           Was Home: C:\IBM\TDI\V6.1.1\AppServer\
           Start Args:
           Restart: 1
      IBM WebSphere Application Server V6 - IBM TDI AMC service
      successfully  added.
   
    2. Approximately 20 seconds after starting the Services in
   Windows
      Service, the status of the service is lost in Windows
   Services. The
      AMC server will remain active and listening for incoming
   browser
      connections, although Windows Service has no connection or
   control of
      the running AMC Server process.
   
   Desired Behavior:
   
    The customer expects the "AMC - Windows Service" correctly
   represent
    the status of the running AMC Server (java) process.
   
   
   FIX:
   
   After reviewing the WASService command syntax in the WAS Express
   v6.0
   documentation, it was found that "-logRoot" is a REQUIRED
   parameter for
   the WASService command.
   
   -logRoot <server_log_directory>
    Required parameter that identifies the server log directory for
   the
    profile. The WASService command looks for a file named
   server_name.pid
    to determine if the server is running."

   EXAMPLE:
   C:\IBM\TDI\V6.1.1\AppServer\bin>WASService.exe -add "TDIAMC"
   -servername
   server1 -profilePath "..\profiles\amcprofile" -logRoot
   "c:\IBM\TDI\V6.1.1\AppServer\pro files\amcprofile\logs\server1"
   -startType automatic
   
   NOTE:  I found that the "-logRoot" needs a static directory path
   to
   work correctly.  Do not use a dynamic path.
   
   Environment:  TDIv6.1.1, Windows
