Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Worklight and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Worklight and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation. IBM Worklight and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2108 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2108]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow when deserializing untrusted ASN.1 structures and later reserializes them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and trigger an out-of-bounds write and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2105 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2106 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2106]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112856 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112856] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2109 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2109]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error. By reading specially crafted ASN.1 data from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available resources and exhaust memory.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2176 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2176]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, By sending an overly long ASN.1 string to the X509_NAME_oneline() function, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to return arbitrary stack data in the buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858] for the current score

This fix was included in APAR PI45508 (from July 2015) when Worklight/MobileFirst was upgraded to OpenSSL 1.0.1p. 
Here is the security bulletin for that APAR: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961179 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961179]. 
Note that you won't see CVE-2016-2108 listed in that security bulletin, because the security impact of the 
bug fixed in 1.0.1o was not discovered until recently. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
