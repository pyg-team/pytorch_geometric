APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WCM ConfigModuleClient (the HTTP client used to execute WCM
   admin modules such as the library data import via ConfigEngine)
   may fail due to authentication issues.
   
   Depending on the security settings on the application server,
   the cookies that is fetched and set to the connection is not
   parsed correctly under some circumstances.
   
   This causes the authentication to fail once an attempt is made
   to establish a connection to the module URL.
   
   The following errors can be seen in the ConfigTrace.log:
   [ConfigModuleClient] Connecting to login address:
   http://serverhost:10039/wps/wcm/login [http://serverhost:10039/wps/wcm/login]
   [ConfigModuleClient] Connecting to task address:
   http://serverhost:10039/wps/wcm/myconnect?MOD=data&processLibrar
   ies=...... [http://serverhost:10039/wps/wcm/myconnect?MOD=data&processLibraries=......]
   .....
   BUILD FAILED

   .wcm/config/includes/prereq.wcm_cfg.xml:4025
   An exception occurred while executing the task: Status returned
   302: Authentication failed for user: wpsadmin
