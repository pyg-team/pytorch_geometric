PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to import a CSV file in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG) results in a CRRRS8653E error code. 

SYMPTOM

The full error message is as follows:

"Validation Errors:
Row Number: 1 (and every other row in a 2 row CSV file)
Error Message: Propagated exception; original message [CRRRS8653E An Apache Jena exception was caused by the following <server.ibm.com>/rm/types/_9LUG4ey_EeORxcFNmIaRgQ;class
com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model.ResourceRequiredException: "" ] "




CAUSE
There is an attribute with a null initial or default value that is causing the error to appear during the import. One possible reason for a null default value is due to work item defect 87990. 

Defect: Business Priority in Use Case Requirements Template has a null default value (87990) [https://jazz.net/jazz03/web/projects/Requirements%20Management#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=87990]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error message has the UUID of the attribute with the problem. In the example error message above, the UUID is _9LUG4ey_EeORxcFNmIaRgQ. Use the following steps to resolve the issue. 

 

 1. Get XML source of the artifact. 
    Build the following URL using the attribute UUID that showed up in the error message received. 
    https:// : /rm/types/ ?accept=*â‰ºivate=true Enter the URL in a browser. The result is in XML format. 
 2. Verify that the attribute has a null initial value and this is the cause of the import error.
    Locate the defaultValue tags in the XML. 
    
    <rm:defaultValue rdf:parseType="Resource">
    <rdf:value></rdf:value>
    </rm:defaultValue>
    
    If they are not present, then there is no initial value set. A null value is not the cause of the import issue. When there is a null initial value, there is no value between the value tags.

 3. Locate the attribute name.
    Search title in the XML, this value is the attribute name. 
    Example: Business Priority
    
    
 4. Update the attribute.
    Open the project properties and make an update to the attribute. This should properly save the attribute resolving the error. 
    
    
    
 5. Validate the error is resolved.
    Import the CSV file to verify the error no longer appears.
