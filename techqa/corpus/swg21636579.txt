Title: IBM Server runtime is created with a trailing "(2)" in the name - United States

Text:
runtime; run-time; run time; server runtime; cannot modify; installed JREs; configure websphere application server; dialog; server configuration; runtime stub; base_v8_stub; base_v7_stub; WAS; (2) TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to create a server runtime for IBM WebSphere Application Server within IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, creates a runtime with a "(2)" appended. 

SYMPTOM
To reproduce the problem: 

 1. Open the workspace where you noticed the problem
    
    
 2. Open the Preferences from Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments to find out which WAS runtimes are defined in this workspace. If there is a server runtime which points to a directory with stub in the name, such as <RAD_INSTALL_DIR>\runtimes\base_v8_stub, a manually created server of that type, such as WAS v8.0, will have a (2), as in the screenshot:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636579&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636579&aid=1] 
You will not be able to change the name of the WAS runtime that already exists.

CAUSE
You have installed RAD with the Tools for developing applications without a local server installation component. 


You have cancelled the server configuration dialog when creating a new workspace, which lead to creation a default WebSphere Application Server runtime using the WAS stub from the tools mentioned above. Additionally, a new Java Runtime Environment (JRE) classpath container is created.

The default WebSphere Application Server is a runtime for a local server or a stub which are created in workspaces that are protected. This means that they are highlighted in yellow and the specified name and directory cannot be changed.


ENVIRONMENT
Rational Application Developer v8.0
WebSphere Application Server v6.1, v7.0, v8.0, v8.5



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SOLUTIONS 

There are several solutions to the problem 

A. Keep using an existing workspace on Rational Application Developer v8.0 

 1. Open the menu Windows > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs
    
    
 2. Select the JREs of the WAS version for which you want to create a server configuration without a (2)
    
    
 3. Press the button Remove and click OK
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636579&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636579&aid=2]
    
 4. Open the menu Windows > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments
    
    
 5. Click the Add... button and specify a name without the (2) in it
    
    
 6. Specify the directory where the runtime environment is installed. If the dialog does not allow you to proceed, you might not have followed Step 1. The JRE added in step 2 will point to the WAS stub and not of the runtime of the full WAS.
    
    
 7. Open the context menu to create a new WAS server configuration within the view Servers


B. Create a new workspace on Rational Application Developer v8.0
Within the Configuring the WebSphere Application Server dialog you have multiple options:


 1. Create a server configuration with the dialog, in case you have a WAS profile
    
    
 2. Follow through the dialog to create a new profile, in case you have no WAS profile yet
    
    
 3. Cancel the dialog and follow the steps for existing workspaces above


C. Uninstall the Tools for developing applications without a local server installation component in RAD 
Do not install the Tools for developing applications without a local server installation component, when installing Rational Application Developer v8.0 or uninstall the component if you have it already installed. 

D. Use Rational Application Developer v8.5 instead of Rational Application Developer v8.0 
Rational Application Developer v8.5 has improved on server creation dialogs and when server runtimes and server configurations are created. For example, no server runtime stub is created when no WAS profile exists.
