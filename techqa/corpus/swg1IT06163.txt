PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************

   All users of IBM Integration Bus and multi-instance broker
   failover.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The IBM Knowledge Center for IBM Integration Bus does not
   describe possible scenarios of failover for multi-instance
   brokers and
   multi-instance queue managers. It is not clear when the failover
   occurs.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Integration Bus Knowledge Center will be updated with a new
   topic referenced from:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.i
   bm.etools.mft.doc/be13650_.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/be13650_.htm]
   
   New Topic: Failing over a multi-instance broker and queue
   manager.
   
   An active broker instance fails over when its associated active
   multi-instance queue manager terminates unexpectedly, or stops
   in a controlled manner. The action of stopping an active broker
   instance on an active multi-instance queue manager does not by
   itself cause a standby broker instance to become active.
   
   Failover scenarios
   
   1. Controlled failover
   
   Stop active queue manager with the endmqm command, switching
   over to a standby instance
   
   endmqm -s
   
   As the active instance of queue manager goes down, the passive
   instance comes up.
   
   2. Immediate failover
   
   Stop active queue manager process with the 'kill' command on
   Unix, or end process using Windows Task Manager on Windows
   
   kill -9
   
   The standby instance of the queue manager will become active.
   
   3. Shutting down the server
   
   Reboot the server, on which the active instance of queue manager
   is running
   
   The passive instance of the queue manager will become active
