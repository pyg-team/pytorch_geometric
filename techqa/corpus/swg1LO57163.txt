APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer disabled "User should be prompted" option to force
   users to upgrade to Roaming User.
   In that case, Notes suddenly shutdown without any confirmation
   message.
   The customer is requesting to have another option for prompting
   confirmation message before shutdown even though "User should be
   prompted" is disabled.
   
   *** Steps to reproduce ***
   1. Administrator registers one Notes User as non-roaming user
   (UserA).
   2. UserA setups Notes Client in PC-A.
   3. Administrator upgraded UserA as roaming user without "User
   should be prompted" option (deselect this option).
   4. UserA setups Notes Client as roaming user in another PC-B.
   PC-B doesn't shutdown after upgrading to the roaming user.
   5. UserA login to Notes Client in PC-B.
   6. Notes Client suddenly restart without any confirmation
   message in PC-B.
   
   *** Analysis ***
   If Administrator enabled the roaming user with "User should be
   prompted" option, confirmation message is shown in step 6, and
   then upgrading to a roaming user is proceed.
   
   ========================
   You have been upgraded to a "roaming user." Your roaming
   replicas are on your roaming server.
   Would you like to upgrade this system with those files? If
   "Convert to roaming now", Notes will shutdown and you will need
   to restart Notes.
   
   - Convert to roaming now
   - Ask me the next time I start Notes
   - Never ask me again, I do not want this computer to roam
