Title: IBM Can I set the batch's priority by calling rrSet (1, @PILOT(PRIORITY))? - United States

Text:
@PILOT; batch priority TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Calling rrSet (1, @PILOT(PRIORITY)) may result in the following error:
==============
The Root Page Node (@P) in search '@PILOT(PRIORITY)' could not be found in calling DCO Route:'B'
============== 

CAUSE
Pilot object is read-only when calling directly. In another word, you can only use rr_Get to retrieve the Pilot object's properties.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to set the Pilot Object's properties, a custom action must be used. Below is a sample logic to set the batch's priority where it could be placed inside a RRX file: 

=================
<af name="SetPriority" access="public" bInter="bInter" bDebug="bDebug" strParam="StrParam" qi="Sets the batch Priority on completion of Rulerunner or DcDesktop task">
<ap> 
A priority between 1 and 9. 1 is highest priority, 9 is lowest.
</ap>
<h>
<e>
<b>SetPriority("2")</b>
</e>
</h>
<lvl>Any</lvl>
<ret>
Always <b>True.</b>
</ret>
<g><![CDATA[

Pilot.Priority = CInt(strParam)
SetPriority = TRUE
]]>
</g>
</af>
