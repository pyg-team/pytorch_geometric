PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Extended Deployment   *
   *                 using the On Demand Router.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Trying to send requests to a particular *
   *                      virtual host and dynamic cluster        *
   *                      results  in improper 404 http response  *
   *                      codes.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The application was installed on multiple dynamic clusters.
   Also, many virutal hosts are defined, which include links to the
   applications on these different servers.  When mapping the
   requests, there was a potential to reference the incorrect
   vhost.  This results in misrouting requests to servers which
   do no support a specific URI.  The result is a 404 issued by
   the application server, when the request could have been
   successfully served had it been sent to a valid application
   server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was fixed to correctly route requests, using a proper
   vhost and URI matcher and the fix was made available for the
   6.1 release. The fix will be included in Service Pack 6.1.0.1
   for WebSphere Extended Deployment.
