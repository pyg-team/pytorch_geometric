ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAMESSO 8.2 IMSFP1
   
   Problem: The verification diagnostic is failing when the
   customer adds a new child domain. The new repository gets added
   properly, but the diagnostics fail with the error 'User does not
   exist'
   
   Additional Information:
   A>  The repository for the child domain gets added
   successfully, but the diagnostics fail.
   
   B> It doesnt look like a problem with connectivity or inability
   to search the child domain. Because, if CC gives an incorrect
   username/pwd for the bind-user, there is an error and the
   repository does not get added.
   
   C> CC is able to login to the child domain from a workstation,
   using the bind-user credentials. This confirms the user already
   exists in the domain.
   
   It is strange that the repository gets added but the diagnostics
   fail.
