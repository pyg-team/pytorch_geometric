Title: IBM Newly created administrator unable to login to Watson Content Analytics admin console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I just created a new administrator user and after going through all the configuration steps in Watson Content Analytics (WCA) and WebSphere Application Server ND (WAS), the user is not allowed access to the admin console. I get a FFQM0103E error stating the user ID is valid but is not registered as an administrative user. Did I overlook something or am I missing a step? 

ANSWER
Most often a step can be overlooked or due to a simple unseen error, a new administrator may be denied login access. To verify the major steps have been taken, please check the following: 

 * 1. Ensure the new WCA admin user is mapped as master admin in WCA 
   2. Ensure the new WCA admin user is role mapped in WAS app security (esadmin, search, analytics) 
   3. Update the es.cfg file on all nodes with the new WCA admin user (master, crawler, search) 
   4. Update the new WCA admin password on all nodes using "eschangepw <password>" (master, crawler, search) 
   5. As the old WCA admin user, run "esadmin configmanager sync" on the master node (This should sync the masterconfig\admin\userid.properties and config\admin\userid.properties files on all nodes) 
   6. As the old WCA admin user, run "esadmin system stopall" on the master node 
   7. Change the WCA Service (not Dmgr, ESAdminServer, Node Agent services) on all nodes to run as the new WCA admin user 
   8. Start the updated WCA and Node Agent services on the crawler and search nodes 
   9. As the new WCA admin user, run "esadmin system stopall" on the master node 
   10. Restart WCA and test your new admin user 


If admin user login is still denied please check the following potential issue:  *  
   
   Sometimes user names are defined with upper case characters in WAS like "CN=NEWUSER01, OU=Users,..." Because Windows Active Directory server handles user names as case insensitive, both "newuser01" and "NEWUSER01" user names can be authenticated, but ESAdmin handles userids.properties as case sensitive. 
   
   For this reason, please define the user name in userids.properties with upper case (as reflected in WAS). This should then allow the NEWUSER01 administrative user to login to the ESAdmin console (without restarting servers). 
   
    * Example: 
      In master_config/admin/userids.properties, system defined user IDs may be incorrect with lower case:

      adminToken.0;11=* 
      newuser01.0;11=* 
      
      Please make the correction to reflect as seen in WAS (CN=NEWUSER01) like: 
      --- 
      #Mon Mar 23 18:43:25 EDT 2015 
      #saved by com.ibm.es.util.ExtendedProperties on Mon Mar 23 18:43:25 EDT 2015 
      adminToken.0;11=* 
      NEWUSER01.0:11=*
