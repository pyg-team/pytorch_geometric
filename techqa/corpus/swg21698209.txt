(2) Check the properties of the data source properties of the package
(3) Run a simple query against the package in Report Studio when login as a system administrator 
(4) Check the cogserver.log and the datasource nameofdatasourceâ€- was query successfully but noted special characters tag at the end of the name as defined. Such html special characters may not show in any html session but will cause abnormal result by any html or xml parser.
(5) Do a deployment export of the package including the datasource and verify the details of the datasource in the dataSource.xml. Check for the name of the datasource involved and it shows nameofdatasourceâ€- while we expect the name should be nameofdatasource.
