Text:
microsoft access database db 2007 IA TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error trying to add data source connection to MS Access 2007 db. The following error is thrown when the "add datasource" option is clicked in Information Analyzer.

ODBC function "SQLConnect" reported: SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -1,022: Msg = [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Your network access was interrupted. To continue, close the database, and then open it again. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the %TMP% and %TEMP% system environment variables are defined properly and those directories are existing with proper permissions to the user.
The Microsoft Jet database engine uses temporary files while you work with Access databases. The recommendation is to configure both the System TEMP environment variable and the TMP environment variable.
