Title: IBM lswhere.exe is no longer distributed with Clementine - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I see that SPSS 16 contains this executable but it appears that Clementine 12.0 does not contain it. Can we get a failure created to have this executable shipped with Clementine client? If so I will create a resolution (internal) to have this noted so others realize it does not currently exist for Clementine 12.0 but has been requested for future releases. If it has to be an ER then let me know. Would really like to get that tool in there though - thanks! 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem is fixed in Modeler 13 General Availability (GA) release. lswhere.exe is shipped in Modeler 13 and later

*** INTERNAL****
If attempting to find out what Sentinel License Manager they are using then look in the options.cfg file for the entry daemonhost= and that will be the LM Server the customer is using. If they are interested in knowing an accumulated list of License Managers this the only option at this point is to see if the customer has an SPSS client install and use the lswhere.exe from that installation. lswhere.exe exists in the root folder of the SPSS directory
