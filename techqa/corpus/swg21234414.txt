PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Here is a quick "how-to" on using a Linux/Unix TEMA with ITM 6.3.x 

ENVIRONMENT
Distributed

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are the steps to get the TEMA WAS agent to work with the ITM 6.2.x or ITM 6.3.x TEPS console: 

1. Install TEMS first from the Linux ITM 6.3.x Monitoring CD.

2. Install TEPS next from the Linux ITM 6.3.x Monitoring CD.

3. Unconfigure your DC, then reconfigure your DC to use the TEMA. (Note: At the time of reconfiguring, you'll get a warning message indicating that the port 63335 can't be reached. This is ok. Ignore it and continue the install of the DC.)

4. Install the TEMA on the DC system from the TEMA Linux/Unix CD.

5. Restart the WAS server/JVM on the DC.

6. Restart the TEMA with this command:
${TEMA_HOME}/itmcmd agent start yn

7. Now install the application support files on both the TEMS and the TEPS. Make sure you have installed application support for the browser client too on the TEPS if you are planning on using the browser client. After you have installed the application support, do this command on the TEMS:
cd $ITM_HOME/bin
./itmcmd support -t <HUB_TEMS_name> yn
- this will copy the cat and attr files for the YN agent

8. Reconfigure the TEPS with this command:
${ITM_HOME}/bin/itmcmd config -A cq

9. Restart the TEPS with this command:
${ITM_HOME}/bin/itmcmd agent start cq

10. Restart the TEMS with this command:
${ITM_HOME}/bin/itmcmd server start <HUB_TEMS_name>

11. Restart your agents with this command:
${ITM_HOME}/bin/itmcmd agent start all (or ${ITM_HOME}/bin/itmcmd agent start yn to start just the yn agent.)

12. Bring up your browser and connect to the TEPS as follows:
http://<TEPS_server>:1920///
- choose second link and login with "syadmin" and password if you have set up one

13. Expand your hostname on the TEPS console and see if the WAS agent shows up now. (You may need to increase Log level from 1 to 2 and higher Sampling Rate to get more data to show up. To increase Log Level simply reconfig the agent again to set the log level permanently.) 

Notes:
* You can put both the TEMS and the TEPS on one system if you wish.
* This was tested on SuSE Linux 10 and SuSE Linux 11 with separate VMWare images for TEMS, TEPS, and TEMA/DC.
* This was also tested on RHEL5 and RHEL6 with separate VMWare images for TEMS, TEPS, and TEMA/DC. Also tested on AIX 6.1 versions with the TEMS/TEPS on one AIX 6.1 server.
* The database used on the TEPS in all cases was DB2 v9.5 FP5 or higher.
