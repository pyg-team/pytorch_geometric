APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TNPM 1.3A - 2.8.0.0 Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Technology Pack
   documentation provided with the Tech Pack states that the only
   supported hardware is SAM v 6, v6.1 and v7. This contradicts the
   information which we were supplied with last year that states
   this version of the Tech Pack would support SAM v8.
   
   Can we please have the documentation updated to state this Tech
   Pack supports SAMv8 on 4.4.3.2 or set the wheels in motion to
   get support for SAM v8 urgently.
