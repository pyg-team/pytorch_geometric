Title: IBM LDAP Users and Groups not displayed when LDAP is added to TIP - United States

Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2LDAP; Tivoli Integrated Portal; LDAP configuration TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 LDAP users and groups do not show up after the LDAP was added to the Federated Repository in Tivoli Integrated Portal. The same LDAP configuration works on another TIP installation. 

SYMPTOM
No errors in the systemOut related to the LDAP configuration.
No errors when saving the LDAP configuration in TIP
Manage Users and Manage Groups do not return the LDAP users or groups.


CAUSE
The LDAP "Directory type" setting did not match the actual directory type being added to TIP. For example, the directory server type was actually MS AD, but the value was set to TDS.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the "Directory type" setting in the LDAP configuration in the Websphere admin console:
Security > Global Security, click the "Configure" button next to the "Available realm definitions" drop down. Click the link in the "Repository identifier" column of the "Repositories in the realm:" table.
Verify the "Directory type" filed matches the actual LDAP directory server type.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the directory type does not match, click on the "Repository Reference" link, and then "Manage repositories". Remove the LDAP configuration. Once the configuration is removed, re-add the LDAP repository:
Click the "Federated Repositories" link, the "Add base entry to realm" button, and then the "Add Repository" button. Complete the LDAP configuration and ensure the "Directory type" specified is correct. When the LDAP configuration is completed, restart TIP and verify the LDAP users and groups show up.
