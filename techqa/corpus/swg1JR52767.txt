APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an operator tries to access the Failed Event Manager panel in
   administrative console, he or she receives a ?null? error
   message in the Deployment Environment panel. A
   NullPointerException is logged in FFDC.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IBM BPM V8.5, the Failed Event Manager panel was moved to the
    Deployment Environment panel. To view the Deployment
   Environment panel, you must log in to the administrative console
    as an administrator. An operator cannot access the Deployment
   Environment panel and, therefore, doesn't have access to the
   Failed Event manager panel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5 that allows an operator to
    view the Deployment Environment panel and the Failed Event
   Manager panel.
