Title: IBM SPSS ODBC import from Sybase gives this error: The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load localization files - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using SPSS for Windows to import some data from a Sybase database. My Data Source appears to be configured correctly because I can use it with a different application, but when I try it with SPSS I get the following set of error messages: 

Connect failed!
The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load localization files!!

One or more following problems may caused the failure

Your sybase home directory is c:\sybase. Check the environment variable SYBASE if it is not the one you want!
Using locale name "English_United States.1252" defined in environment variable LC_ALL
Locale name "English_United States.1252" doesn't exist in your c:\sybase\locales\locales.dat file

Any ideas why this is happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are many different locale definitions, and the locales.dat file gives Sybase the instructions for how to treat any specific locale name -- mapping it to a default locale and code page.

Open your locales.dat file in Notepad and locate the platform you are operating on. Insert this line in the list of locales:

locale = English_United States.1252, us_english, cp1252

and then save the file, taking care to preserve the filename and type. Now try the ODBC import again
