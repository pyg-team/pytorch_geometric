QUESTION
 How can I change the user name label that appears in the login dialog. 

ANSWER
The label for user name is set in the maxmessages table. 

You can reference the record with the following statement:
select * from MAXMESSAGES where MSGGROUP='login' and MSGKEY='username';

You can update the VALUE column with the value you want in order to change the label.
Once you update the value on the maxmessage record where MSGGROUP='login' and MSGKEY=username', you will need to restart the Maximo application server for the changes to take effect.
