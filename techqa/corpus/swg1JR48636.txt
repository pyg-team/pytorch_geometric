PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM Business Process Manager                *
   *                  administrators, process modelers, and       *
   *                  testers who import, export, or install      *
   *                  process application or toolkit snapshots.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The temporary directory becomes full    *
   *                      because trace files are left inside     *
   *                      the local file system after import,     *
   *                      export, and install operations are      *
   *                      completed. During the import, export,   *
   *                      or install operations, each snapshot    *
   *                      is extracted to the temporary folder    *
   *                      and the contents are parsed. After      *
   *                      the import, export or install           *
   *                      operation are completed, the            *
   *                      temporary content remains on the file   *
   *                      system.  On Linux machine, the          *
   *                      temporary folder is  &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#156;/tmp &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;&#226;&#132;&#162;.
   *                      Windows machine, the temporary folder   *
   *                      is the same as %TEMP% system variable   *
   *                      defined.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   IBM BPM does not remove temporary content after a snapshot has
   been imported, exported, or installed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With the fix installed, all files that are created during the
   import, export, or install operations are removed when the
   operation is completed.
