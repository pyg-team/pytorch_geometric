RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restarting server will resolve the issue. It is part of the deployment. See more details in the following Knowledge center link: 
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSWSR9_11.3.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.wb.tools.models.doc/c_Addition_and_Extension_Deployment_in_OSGi_Framework.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSWSR9_11.3.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.wb.tools.models.doc/c_Addition_and_Extension_Deployment_in_OSGi_Framework.html] 

Also you can restart servers one by one in cluster.
