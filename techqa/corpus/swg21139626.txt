QUESTION
 How to disable the SSL communication between PD and Ldap. 

ANSWER
In each PD server's configuration file there is an [ldap] stanza that
will have 'ssl-enable' set to yes or no.
If yes, then it will use the specified keyfile and keyfile pwd to talk
SSL to LDAP, if no, then it will use the bind-dn and bind-pwd to talk TCP to ldap.

If you want to disable SSL communication between PD and Ldap
servers then you can modify the PD server's configuration file
(ivmgrd.conf) for [ldap] stanza configuring 'ssl-enable' =no
and restarting the PD server.

Otherwise, you will need to use ldap web application to change the
ldap configuration for SSL.
You should set 'ssl off' or 'ssl on' but not 'ssl only' there.

The recommendation is you configure it as 'ssl on' since in this
way webseal could be still able to work using SSL communication.

The 'SSL off' option won't allow the webseal to use SSL communication
and this will cause a big security exposure for Webseal server.
