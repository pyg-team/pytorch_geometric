Title: IBM Batch Jobs Running on Interactive Only Servers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 System has been configured to run batch jobs on dedicated batch servers by disabling the "Batch Report Service" on interactive servers. However, we still see batch jobs being executed on these servers. 

SYMPTOM
We have configured our production Cognos 8.4.1 environment to route Interactive report transactions on specific servers and to route batch report transactions to specific servers. This has been done specifically to eliminate the posibility of Batch Jobs interfering with users running reports interactively and also to insure that critical batch jobs do not have to contend with interactive requests. 

 

To facilitate this, in Cognos Configuration we have turned off (set to false) the Report Service on batch servers and the Batch Report Service on interactive servers. 

 

We have noticed that batch reports continue to be executed on interactive servers. 


CAUSE
Although the Interactive servers had been configured with the "Batch Report Service" set to "False", we also need to disable the "Job Service" by setting that service to "False" in Cognos Configuration. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On dedicated Interactive report servers, disable the Job Service in addition to the Batch Report Service.
