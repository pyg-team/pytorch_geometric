ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   
   The time to load a model in Reporter Plus has drastically increa
   sed ever since an upgrade to 7.5.1
   
   Product/component
       Rhapsody v7.5.1 / System Architect
   
   Environment
       WindowsXP Sp2
   
   Problem/Symptom
   Loading of the Rhapsody model in the Reporter Plus takes a very
   long time after the upgrade.
   
   - The size of the Rhapsody model for which Reporter Plus  is Inv
   oked  82 MB
   - Sample model of around 40 MB takes 30 mts of time to load
   - version of Rhapsody used before in which Reporter Plus was fas
   ter : 7.4
   - Approx time difference between 7.4 and 7.5 loading the same mo
   del : twice the time
   - Delay with other components  : Slight delay seen while Import/
   Export XMI of the same model.
   
   
   Replication steps

   Business impact
       This has no critical impact on customer's work. However the
   long time taken to load a model and this dip in performance is a
   cting as a deterrant in the product usage after the upgrade.
   
   
   Support Observations:
   We have noticed that 7.5.1 takes around 45 mts for a 40 MB model
    which is slower than at the customer end.
   I guess it might be because of the superior system resources at
   the customer end.
   
   v7.5.2 didnt finish the model load even after an hour at support
    clearly showing a regressive behaviour as far as performance is
    concerned.
