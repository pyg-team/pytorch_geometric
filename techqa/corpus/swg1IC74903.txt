APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using slashes in the Distinguished Name name fields such as CN,
   O, OU, L, will fail SSLPEER value verification, and as such SSL
   Handshake, due to an MQ parsing error.  MQ uses slashes (/) to
   delimit the distinguished name values when matching the SSLPEER
   value with the information contained in the certificate.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The only workaround is to generate certificates with
   Distinguished Name values that do not contain a slash.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   CERTIFICATES CONTAINING SLASHES IN THE
   DISTINGUISHED NAME (DN) FIELDS FAIL WEBSPHERE
   MQ VERIFICATION, THEREFORE SSL HANDSHAKE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Using slashes in the Distinguished Name name
   fields such as CN, O, OU, L, will fail
   SSLPEER value verification, and as such SSL
   Handshake, due to an MQ parsing error. WMQ
   uses slashes (/) to delimit the
   distinguished name values when matching the
   SSLPEER value with the information contained
   in the certificate.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *   The only workaround is to generate certificates
   with
   Distinguished Name values that do not contain a
   slash.
