QUESTION
 What is the order of precedence when defining a SESSIONTIMEOUT? 

ANSWER
NPS offers the following session attributes: 

 * DEFPRIORITY 
 * MAXPRIORITY 
 * ROWSETLIMIT 
 * SESSIONTIMEOUT 
 * QUERYTIMEOUT 


To set the attribute values, NPS uses the following order of precedence rules: 
 * If the attribute is set on the USER, use that value. 
 * If the attribute is not set on the USER, use the most restrictive value of all GROUPS in which that user is a member.
