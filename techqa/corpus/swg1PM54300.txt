APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This situation occurs with either local syntax check or edit
   with RDz client.
   The user opens the main file from an RDz subproject which is
   associated with PLI include files.
   The PLI include files are available in Host libraries and are
   downloaded to the client.
   He closes the subproject file.
   Meanwhile on ISPF (or by using Host Emulator), a Host include
   file is changed and saved.
   When that include file is opened from RSE view, the new updates
   made on the Host are not available.
   .
   This problem also occurs if changes are made to Host COBOL
   copybooks.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   
   USERS AFFECTED:
   RD/z users who use RD/z to edit PL/I programs or COBOL
   programs and change PL/I include files or COBOL copybooks
   outside of RD/z.
   ****************************************************************
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When editing PL/I programs with include files or COBOL
   programs with copybooks, RD/z downloads the include files or
   copybooks to a workspace cache. If the include files or
   copybooks had timestamps, and the include files or timestamps
   were modified outside of RD/z, the cached version of the include
   files or copybooks was displayed when they were edited in RD/z
   after being modified. Also, local syntax check used the cached
   version.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ************************************************************
   PROBLEM RESOLUTION:
   RD/z displays the updated version of include files or
   copybooks when they are opened in an RD/z editor. Also, local
   syntax check will use the updated version of the include files
   or copybooks rather than the cached version.
