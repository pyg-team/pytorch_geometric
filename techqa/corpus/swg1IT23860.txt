APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The AMQ9777 error message outputs the SSLPEER for a channel that
   does not
   have SSL/TLS enabled. The following is an example of what was
   seen in the error message:
   .
   SSLPEER('CN=XXXXX,OU=XXXXX,O=XXXXX')
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disregard the inserted SSLPEER value in the message if the
   channel is not using SSL/TLS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of MQ with an SSLPEER value defined on channel definition
   which has SSL/TLS disabled for the particular channel.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If the SSLPEER attribute was set for a channel definition, but
   the channel was not configured to use SSL/TLS (no value
   configured for SSLCIPH), then a logic error in the error message
   routines would insert this in messages such as AMQ9777 which
   take an SSLPEER as an insert. This was incorrect, as the
   inserted SSLPEER should reflect the peer name of the remote end
   of the channel, which will be empty if SSL/TLS is not in use.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The programming error has been resolved so that SSLPEER
   information is suppressed when SSL is not enabled for the
   channel.
