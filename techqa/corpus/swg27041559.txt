 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this document is to provide the step-by-step details for connecting the WebSphere MQ Explorer and MQ Javaâ„¢ clients V7.1 or V7.5 from one workstation (such as running in Windows) to a queue manager running on another workstation, using SSL. 

CONTENT
To provide better background, because the MQ Explorer uses the MQ classes for Java, it is necessary to cover also the setup for an MQ client that uses the MQ classes for Java. 

The chapters are:
Chapter 1: Connecting MQ Java client to a single-instance queue manager with SSL
Chapter 2: Connecting MQ Explorer to a single-instance queue manager with SSL

See the following companion techdoc:
Using SSL to connect MQ C-based client to a queue manager in WebSphere MQ 7.1 and 7.5 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27041551]

This document uses the SSL commands that are provided in MQ 7.1 and 7.5. The SSL commands in MQ 7.0 were renamed in MQ 7.1 and 7.5. 

The following techdoc shows the SSL commands used in MQ 7.0:
