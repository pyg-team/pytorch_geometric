   WTXCQ - WTX00000819
   TR / TR
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Added conditional compilation code so we'd use GlobalAllocPtr on
   Windows.  Adjusted the sizes of a couple of memory allocations
   to be appropriate for the data we were putting in those areas.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added conditional compilation code so we'd use GlobalAllocPtr on
   Windows.  Adjusted the sizes of a couple of memory allocations
