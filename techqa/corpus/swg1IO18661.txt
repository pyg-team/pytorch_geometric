 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After it is upgraded to IBM Content Manager 8.4.3, text search
   query may fail to find plain text documents if the default CCSID
   for the database is different from the one for the document's
   code page.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Drop and recreate indexes for item types.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * 999                                                          *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * In Content Manager version 8.4.3, the handling of plain text *
   * document is not correct if the following conditions are met: *
   *                                                              *
   * a/ the text index CCSID option that is specified in System   *
   * Administration during creation of the text index is          *
   * different from the database code page.                       *
   * b/ The plain text document being imported has the CCSID the  *
   * same as the CCSID option.                                    *
   *                                                              *
   * As an example, the use case that will encounter the problem  *
   * is as follows: If the text index was created before version  *
   * 8.4.3 with a local codepage CCSID such as Japanese while the *
   * default database codepage is Unicode, after upgrading to     *
   * 8,4,3, the new imported plain text document whose CCSID is   *
   * Japanese will not be text indexed correctly.                 *
   *                                                              *
   * There are several changes in this fix:                       *
   * a/ The environment variable IBMCCSID , which was used to     *
   * identify the plain text document CCSID before, is dropped in *
   * 8.4.3 since it is not needed . The reason is that the only   *
   * supported CCSID of plain text document is that it is the     *
   * same as the CCSID option of the text index when it is        *
   * created.                                                     *
   * b/ The CCSID option in Sysadmin client panel is re-activated *
   * . It was incorrectly grayed out in 8.4.3                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * No                                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is now fixed in IBM Content Manager Version 8.4.3
   Fixpack 4.
