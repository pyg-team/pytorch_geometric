APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You were experiencing problems with the SafeNet Sentinel RMS
   License Manager consistent with APAR PI42143 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI42143].  You applied the
   "License Manager 9.5.0.2 IF001" fix from that APAR, or you have
   now upgraded to the IBM Concurrent License Manager Tools 9.6,
   which is also based on the Sentinel RMS License Manager 8.6.1.
   
   In either case, you now see a scenario where the license manager
   executable (lservnt.exe) continues to grow until it crashes,
   forcing you to restart the service so your end users can check
   out licenses once more.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a future release.
   If at all possible, best practice will always be to deploy the
   SafeNet Sentinel RMS License Manager behind a firewall and thus
   eliminate all external threats.  In this way only authorized end
   users will have access to the license manager and the available
   product tokens.
   Our recommendation is to set up a scheduled task to restart the
   License Manager service ('Sentinel RMS License Manager') at
   regular intervals. As long as the restart process takes place in
   less than 5 minutes, there should be no interruption of service
   to License Manager clients.
