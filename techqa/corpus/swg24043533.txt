DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Agent Builder v6.3.4 works in both IBM Tivoli Monitoring and IBM Application Performance Management environments.

By creating a monitoring agent, you can use either of these environments to monitor any type of in-house or customized software.


It includes the following new capabilities: 

 *  Support is improved for building Cloud APM summary dashboards for Agent Builder agents. You must use single-row data sets to provide data for summary dashboards. You can provide such data sets from entire log files and from any sets of data that can be filtered to a single row.
