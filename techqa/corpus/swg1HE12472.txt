APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Indexing a message with IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search
   Services Support fails with failure code 64 indicating that
   no text has been extracted from an attachment file.
   
   IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Services Support
   checks if the text that is extracted from an attachment
   consists of spaces or end of line controls only. If there is
   no other text except for spaces and end of line controls in
   the extracted content, IQQP0027W will be added to the index
   xml document. However, IBM Content Collector P8 Content
   Search Services Support uses an incorrect detection for the
   extracted text which begins with a space and is followed by
   actual text. Thus, if the extracted text begins with space,
   IQQP0027W will be reported to the xml document.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1.0 LA013, IBM Content
   Collector P8 Content Search Services Support corrected the
   detection, so that extracted content beginning with space will
   also be detected correctly, and IQQP0027W is not added to the
   xml document any more.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
