APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If a table view is configured to display historical summarized
   data and the view-level page size is changed from 'Use default'
   to 'Return all rows', the 'Recording Time' column will appear 3
   times and the last two data columns will not appear.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Experimentation shows that replacing a bar chart does not need
   to be part of the scenario. Minimal scenario:
   
   1-Enable history, warehouse and S&P for some attribute group (I
   used Windows OS, Memory (superseded)) and allow data to
   accumulate and be summarized. MTEMS S&P agent configure can be
   used to force frequent summarization.
   
   2-Select and place a table adapter on a workspace and configure
   to display data from the attribute group enabled in step 1.
   Leave 'View-level Page Size' at 'Use default'
   
   3-Open timespan dialog and set to display summarized data
   
   4-Open Properties dialog and change to either 'Return all rows'
   or set 'Number of rows to return'.
   
   5-Click OK
   Observe that Recording Time is repeated 3 times and the last
   two data columns before 'Time Stamp' and 'Server Name' are
   removed. In my test, the 'Committed kBytes' and 'Free System
   Page Table Entries' were lost.
   
   Despite testing and trace analysis, I am still not sure where
   the problem lies although it looks more and more like TEP.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the table to show realtime data.
   Set the view-level page size to the desired value.
   Set the timespan to display the desired summarized data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Recording Time column appears more than once in a historical
   summarized view.
   
   
   If the View-level page size for a historical view of summarized
   data is changed, the Recording Time column will appear more than
   once.  A data column will be removed from the end of the table
   for each extra Recording Time column that appears.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The logic was changed to prevent the extra Recording Time
   columns from being added and forcing other columns to be
   removed.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0004
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Set the desired View-level page size while the view is
   displaying detail data and then configure the view to display
   summarized data.
