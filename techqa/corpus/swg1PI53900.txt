ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 or 23 installed on an Apple
   Macintosh 10.10.5 as network installation. The concurrent
   network license is served by a Windows host where Sentinel
   License Manager 8.5.0.0021 is installed. Your network license is
   for multiple users and include Base module and some other
   modules for example Custom table.
   You have a user who needs the add on module Advanced Statistics,
   but only one user so you purchased a single (authorized) user
   license for this add on module only and not a network
   (concurrent) license for this add on module Advanced Statistics.
   Therefore on the Macintosh client you open a terminal.app, cd to
   installation directory of the SPSS 22 or 23 release and run
   ./licenseactivator <your single user authorization code>
   to license the add on module on this Macintosh Client computer
   only.
   The operation shows to be successful and you see the license
   code for the add on module in a new created file lservrc on /bin
   folder.
   However, if you launch the program you do not see any menu
   entries for the Advanced Statistics module. You can only work
   with the menu entries that are served by the concurrent license
   for the Sentinel license manager.
   
   From the help you see that this kind of mixed licensing should
   work, as your Base license is served by the Sentinel RMS License
   manager host:
   
   ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/s
   tatistics/23.0/en/client/InstallationDocuments/MacOS/Concurrent_
   License_Administrator_Guide.pdf
   
   "Mixed licensing
   IBM SPSS Statistics has limited support for a mixed licensing
   environment (a combination of local
   authorized user licenses and concurrent licenses). In a typical
   environment, all licenses are handled
   locally or through the concurrent license manager. For example,
   if the main product is licensed through
   the concurrent license manager, add-on modules are also licensed
   through the concurrent license
   manager.
   
   The only option for mixed licensing is to license the main
   product through the concurrent license
   manager and to license the add-on modules on the end user's
   computer with licenseactivator. To set up
   this type of mixed licensing, install IBM SPSS Statistics with a
   concurrent license. Then use licenseactivator
   on the end user's computer to license the add-on modules. For
   more information about licenseactivator, see
   "Using licenseactivator to install a license automatically" on
   page 7.
   IBM SPSS Statistics does not support the opposite scenario to
   license the main product locally and to
   license the add-on modules through the concurrent license
   manager."
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a future FixPack or release.
   Please use either network licenses for the add on modules or use
   single user licenses for all modules on the Macintosh Clients.
