QUESTION
 What is the ERI and how do I enable it? 

ANSWER
The External Report Integration enables you to integration external report systems within the V7 Framework. These external reports can then be visible from within the various Applications, and the 'where clause' can be dynamically passed to these external report systems. 

This document will overview this functionality and detail how to enable it.
