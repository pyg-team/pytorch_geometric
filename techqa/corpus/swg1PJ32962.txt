APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user with more than 130000 active workflows is trying to
   access the "My Active Workflows" page. It takes a long a very
   time to load the page and in the end fails with an out of
   memory error.
   System crashes and the AE has to be restarted (not the case on
   my test system).
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Create 100000 workflows (simple one, with just a general
   step with F_Originator as participant for example).
   2. Log in a the user who created the workflows.
   3. Go to the Task page, My Inbox => works fine
   4. Go to My Active Workflows
   => the system becomes  busy for a very long time, until IE
   returns an error.
   Actual Results:
   The page never finishes to load and causes the Application
   Server to run out of memory.
   Expected Results:
   The "My Active Workflows" should display without a long delay
   and without using all the available memory. One would expect
   "My Active Workflows" to behave just like "My Inbox" and
   limit the number of results returned.
