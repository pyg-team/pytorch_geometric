QUESTION
 How do you send a Microsoft速 SQL Server or Oracle databases as a Microsoft Access databases to IBM速 Rational速 ClearQuest速 support for debugging? 

ANSWER
In this method, a copy of the SQL Server or Oracle database will be made into an MS_Access database, and the .mdb file can be sent in.

Open a DOS command prompt window. 


 1. To copy the current schema repository (MASTR) database to Access, use the command:
    Format used prior to ClearQuest 2002:
    
    installutil copyschemarepo cq_login cq_password MS_ACCESS ""
    "\\full\path\to\masterdb.mdb" admin admin admin admin admin admin ""
    
    
    Format used with ClearQuest 2002 and 2003:
    
    installutil copyschemarepo -dbset <dbset_name> cq_login cq_password MS_ACCESS ""
    "\\full\path\to\masterdb.mdb" admin admin admin admin admin admin ""
    
    where
    
    cq_login = CQ admin login
    cq_password = password for login (use "" if no password)
    dbset_name = connection name in ClearQuest Maintenance Tool appearing under Existing Connections
    First admin and password pair = Administrator Name and Password
    Second admin and password pair = Read/Write User Name and Password
    Third admin and password pair = Read-Only User Name and Password
    
    
 2. To copy a user database to MS Access, use the command:
    
    Format used prior to ClearQuest 2002:
    
    > installutil copyuserdb cq_login cq_password user_dbname MS_ACCESS
    "" "\\full\path\to\userdb.mdb" admin admin admin admin ""
    
    Format used with ClearQuest 2002 and 2003:
    > installutil copyuserdb -dbset <dbset_name> cq_login cq_password user_dbname MS_ACCESS "" "\\full\path\to\userdb.mdb" admin admin admin admin ""
    
    where
    
    cq_login = CQ admin login
    cq_password = password for login (use "" if no password)
    user_dbname = 5-char logical user db name
    dbset_name = connection name in ClearQuest Maintenance Tool appearing under Existing Connections
    First admin and password pair = Administrator Name and Password
    Second admin and password pair = Read/Write User Name and Password
    
    Then, zip the .mdb file or files. If the file is less than 2 Mb, you can send the file in e-mail but if it is larger, contact ClearQuest technical support for instructs for sending the file to the FTP site.
    


Note: Running the commands above will place a logical lock on the database preventing new users from login to ClearQuest while the command is running. The lock will be released after the command completes.
