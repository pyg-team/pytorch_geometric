 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to configure IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager to communicate over secure sockets in compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-131A standard in strict mode? 

ANSWER
NIST SP 800-131 is a US government computer security standard that is used to accredit cryptographic modules. For more information about the SP 800 series of computer security publications, see the NIST website: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html] 

This task uses the WASAdmin user ID on the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console to configure compliance for NIST SP 800-131A in IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager. 


1. Log on to WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console (https://<localhost>:9083/ibm/console/logon.jsp).
2. On the browser Welcome page, type the user ID WASAdmin and the password for this administrator.
3. Click Security > SSL certificate and key management > Manage FIPS. 

 * 

4. To convert certificates, under Related Items, click Convert Certificates. 
5. Select Strict, and choose algorithm SHA256withRSA to use for the new certificates from the list. 
6. Select the size 2048 bits for certificate from the New certificate key size drop-down list.  * Note:
 * 

7. If no certificates are displayed in the Certificates that can not be converted frame, click Apply and OK.  * 
 * Certificates that can not be converted
 * 
 *   * The certificate was created by a Certificate Authority (CA) 
    * The certificate is in a read only keystore
   
   

8. Click SSL certificate and key management > Manage FIPS. 
9. Select Enable SP800-131. 
10. Select Strict. 
11. Click Apply and OK. 
12. Click Save to save the configuration. 
13. Stop WebSphere Application Server.  * a. Navigate to the <WAS_HOME >/bin directory. 
   b. Run the following command.  * Windows systems
    *  stopServer.bat server1 
    * Systems such as Linux or AIX
    *  ./stopServer.sh server1 
   
   

14. In the <SKLM_HOME>/config/SKLMConfig.properties file, edit the TransportListener.ssl.protocols and fips properties with these values.  *  TransportListener.ssl.protocols=SSL_TLSv2
   fips=on 

15. In the <WAS_HOME>/profiles/KLMProfile/properties/ssl.client.props file, edit the com.ibm.ssl.protocol property with this value.  *  com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2 

16. Start WebSphere Application Server.  * a. Navigate to the <WAS_HOME >/bin directory. 
   b. Run the following command.  * Windows systems
    *  startServer.bat server1 
    * Systems such as Linux or AIX
    *  ./startServer.sh server1
