Title: IBM Removing elements from a message tree using a mapping node - United States

Text:
msgmap mapping mappings node nodes blank null empty delete deleting TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to use the Message Mapping Node in your WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) message flow to remove an element from the message tree. 

SYMPTOM
In Message Broker version 5, you were able to map an element to "null" and it would be removed. However, using "null" in V6.x or V7 or V8 results in an error in the toolkit. 

Note: IBM Integration Bus (IIB) V9 uses the graphical data mapper. This technote does not apply to IIB.


CAUSE
WBIMB Version 5.0 message maps have a procedural programming model, which is, essentially, an alternative ESQL where you describe all the steps that are required to perform a transformation. 


WebSphere Message Broker versions 6.x and higher use a declarative programming model, where you describe the result of the transformation, and the tools determine how to achieve that result.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
At versions 6.x and higher, leave the mapping source for your target element blank, and that element will be removed from the message tree.
