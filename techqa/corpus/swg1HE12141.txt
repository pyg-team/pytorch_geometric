APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use IBM Content Collector Search for searching in
   archived email and the mailbox and move an item from the Outlook
    search result list to a folder in your mailbox or an Outlook
   data file (.pst), the operation succeeds (the message is copied
   to the destination folder), but an error message is displayed,
   for example:
   * Cannot move the items. MAPI_W_PARTIAL_COMPLETION
   * Cannot move the items. MAPI_E_INTERFACE_NOT_SUPPORTED
   * Cannot move the items. The item cannot be moved. It was either
   already moved or deleted, or access was denied.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A search result list is not a folder in the store hierarchy, but
    a view. It contains only references to the items in the search
   result list. Therefore, items cannot be moved but only be
   copied. If the Outlook user tries to move an item from a search
   result list, the item is copied to the destination folder but is
    not deleted from the search result list.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with interim fix 4.0.0.0-IBM-ICC-OE-IF004, the IBM
   Content Collector Outlook Extension will not display an error
   when moving an item from the search result list.
