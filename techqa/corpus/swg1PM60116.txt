APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS CM initialization fails with Abend ABM8 in program
   CCVSMSGH, when the invocation transaction CCVI is entered as a
   console command (e.g. /F <region>,CCVI).  The CICS CCVLOG DD
   contains message "CCV5352W Heartbeat value in Product Anchor
   Block is INVALID" and CICS CM startup fails to complete. CICS CM
   is inoperable. Subsequent Abends (e.g. S0C7) may be experienced
   in program CCVSWASH.

   ****************************************************************
   CICS CM initialisation fails with Abend ABM8 in program
   CCVSMSGH, when:
   1. The invocation transaction CCVI is entered as a console
   command (e.g. F <region>,CCVI); or
   2. The CICS region has been incorrectly defined with SIT
   parameter TCPIP=NO.
   
   The CICS region's DDname CCVLOG contains message "CCV5352W
   Heartbeat value in Product Anchor Block is invalid", and CICS CM
   start up fails to complete.  CICS CM is inoperable.  Subsequent
   Abends (e.g. S0C7) may be experienced in program CCVSWASH.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CICS CM initialization program (CCVIINIT) and message
   handler (CCVSMSGH) have been corrected to suppress message
   sending to terminal devices incapable of supporting
   those messages, thereby resulting in ABEND ABM8.
   The CICS CM clean-up program (CCVSWASH) is corrected to bypass
   processing if a previous processing failure has left the
   product anchor block flagged as initialization incomplete.
