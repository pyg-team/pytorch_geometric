PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Get Document Info Service throws error when a correlation contains & character 

SYMPTOM
Error in WF log:-

CAUSE
The issue occurred because '&' character was not escaped as '&amp;'.
This was set explicitly in the Business Process (BP) but when the value is passed from BP to the specific java class for further processing, it is again converted back to '&'.
This defect was also observed when the 'VALUE' element in the CorrelationService contained the '&' character.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is identified as a defect under APAR IT02283


The fix is planned for release in patch 5105
