APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the mqistartmsgflow and mqsistopmsgflow commands to
   start and stop an execution group (EG) with broker
   administration
   security enabled, the user must have execute access on the EG
   specific SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG queue. If this queue does not
   exist, then
   the following BIP2853E and BIP2865E messages will be logged, but
   the execution group will still be started or stopped.
   
    +BIP2853E (Msg 1/2) MQ10BRK 28 THE BROKER WAS UNABLE TO CHECK
    AUTHORIZATION FOR USER 'CLAPPER ' (SUBCOMPONENT 'EG1'). THE
   REQUEST HAS BEEN REJECTED OWING TO THIS ERROR, EVEN THOUGH THE
   USER MAY IN FACT BE AUTHORIZED.
   
    +BIP2865E (Msg 2/2) MQ10BRK 28 AUTHORIZATION CHECK FAILED FOR
   USER 'CLAPPER ' SUBCOMPONENT 'EG1' BECAUSE A REQUIRED WEBSPHERE
   MQ QUEUE 'SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG1' WAS NOT FOUND.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 and IBM Integration

   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using the mqistartmsgflow and mqsistopmsgflow commands to
   start and stop an execution group (EG) with broker
   administration security enabled, the user must have execute
   access on the EG specific SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH. queue. If this
   queue does not exist, then BIP2853E and BIP2865E messages will
   be logged explaining the failure, however, the execution group
   will still be started or stopped.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The execution group is no longer started/stopped if the user
   fails the authorisation check on the SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH. queue
   when starting/stopping the execution group using the
   mqsistart/stopmsgflow commands.
