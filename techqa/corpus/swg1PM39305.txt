You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I'm running a FACTOR command with a very long list of variables.
   The Output Viewer lags a very long time before displaying my
   output. This is because the Notes object of the Viewer is trying
   to reiterate the long command syntax (in this case a list of
   40000 variables).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make use of the TO keyword in your command syntax whenever you
   can.  For example rather than listing 1000 contiguous variables
   singly, list the first and last connected by the TO keyword to
   get every variable in between them as well.

   * Upgrade to IBM SPSS Statistics 20.  Alternatively, run       *
   * shorter command syntax by making good use of the TO keyword  *
   * to shorten the variable lists.                               *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Upgrade to IBM SPSS Statistics 20.  Alternatively, run shorter
   command syntax by making good use of the TO keyword to shorten
   the variable lists.
