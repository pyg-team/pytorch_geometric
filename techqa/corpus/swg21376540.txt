PROBLEM
In Lotus Notes 8.5, you receive a message from an Internet user that contains an attachment. You would like to edit the attachment, instead of saving it locally to your computer. You notice the Edit option and also the Delete option in the right-click menu and as well as in the dialog box when you double click the attachment are grayed out. You are also not able to delete the attachments, as you were in releases prior to Notes 8.5. If you right-click on any such attachment you can only Save, View, or Open.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issue regarding deleting attachments was addressed in 8.5.1. The portion of the issue regarding editing attachments is considered to be working as designed.

Fix details: SPR# SIWA7HF52V [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/SPR/SIWA7HF52V] [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/SPR/JCOL6ERQDB]
Work was done in Notes 8.5 to put unreferenced HTML attachments on top of the HTML email message this is being displayed. Several usability concerns were discovered as a result, one of which was the fact the user was no longer able to delete the attachment via the right click menu when reading the email message. These attachments are in a section at the top of the form in Notes 8.5.1, and furthermore can be deleted when reading the email message via the right click menu.

Refer to the Upgrade Central [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/support/upgradecentral/index.html] site for details on upgrading Notes/Domino. 


In Notes 8.5.1, you are still not able to edit attachments unless the document is placed in edit mode. This was reported to development under SPR GHAT7X8RF3, but was closed, as this functionality was determined to be working as designed. 


Workaround
As a workaround, save the attachment locally to edit. Another work around is to put the document into edit mode and then you will see options to edit and/or delete. Attachment may also move from the top of the document down to the bottom.
