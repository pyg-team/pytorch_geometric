QUESTION
 When does map processing change the encoding of data? 

CAUSE
Functions that use the WebSphere Transformation Extender EXIT architecture convert data to the native character set of the platform as part of the function call.

ANSWER
The following functions use the WebSphere Transformation Extender EXIT architecture. These functions convert data to native character-set encoding as part of the function call: 

 * DBLOOKUP 
 * DBQUERY 
 * DDEQUERY 
 * EXIT 
 * JEXIT 
 * GET 
 * PUT 
 * RUN 
 * XQUERY 
 * XSLT 
 * MATHLIB functions 
 * XMLLIB functions (except XPATH and XPATHEX) 
 * RESOURCELIB functions (GETRESOURCEALIAS, GETLOCALE, and GETTXINSTALLDIRECTORY) 
 * Customer-developed functions that use the EXIT architecture


Maps that use these functions must take the data conversion into account. For example, a map that uses the EXIT architecture converts non-EBCDIC data to EBCDIC when the map runs on a z/OS platform. To prevent the data conversion, the map must use a function like: 

CTEXT(object, "Native") 

If the function returns the data from the z/OS platform to another platform, the map must specify that the data to return is non-EBCIDIC by using a function like: 

CTEXT(object, "data language")
