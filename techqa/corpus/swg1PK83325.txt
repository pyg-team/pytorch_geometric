PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary:
   Confusing error message when attempting to 'Save As' in WCM
   authoring.
   
   Detailed Problem:
   When a client attempts to save a new content item and in
   the 'Select  a Site Area' dialog chooses a content item and
   selects the 'First Child' option,
    a reasonable error message is shown: "IWKAU2007E: Only site
   areas may be selected if using First child or Last child
   position." However, when a client attempts to perform
   a 'Save As' on an existing content item in the scenario above, a
   generic/confusing error message is displayed: "Operation failed
   due to an exception."
   In addition, a null pointer exception is thrown in the
   SystemOut.log file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Analysis:
   In the 'Save As' case, WCM attempts to handle the mistake made
   by the client by performing a transformation that would result
   in content item
   being added as an immediate sibling of the selected content
   item. However, it is using a sibling value of null, which is the
   default when the 'First Child' or 'Last Child' option
   is selected. This was resulting in the null pointer exception.
   
   Problem Solution:
   It was determined that a successful transformation would not be
   consistent with the behavior in the 'Save' case for a new
   content item, where an appropriate
   error message is displayed. The 'Save As' case has been modified
   to generate the same error message for the same scenario.
