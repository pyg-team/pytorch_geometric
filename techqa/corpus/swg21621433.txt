Title: IBM Installation failure when using CPIT - United States

Text:
CPIT; PE 5.0.0.3 client TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using IBM FileNet Composite Platform Installation Tool 5.1 (CPIT) to install P8 5.1, the installation fails in half way, and threw an error. 

SYMPTOM
The error message reads " 5.0.0.3 client wan.exe can't be find".


CAUSE
As the default setting, CPIT has to install IBM Content Navigator 2.0.0, which by default embeds IBM FileNet Process Engine（PE）5.0.0.3 client, so it requires the same PE client installer for other components such as Content Engine. But the customer had PE 5.0.0 base client installer, that was why the issue occurred. 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Navigator 2.0.0

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download the PE 5.0.0.3 client installer, and reference it in the cpit.properties file, to do it:




1. open the cpit.properties in any editor tools such as notepad 

2. modify the related entry below(depend on the platform) to match with the actual name of the PE client installer.
