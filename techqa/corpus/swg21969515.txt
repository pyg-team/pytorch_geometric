PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User receives a report version is not supported error when opening a report in IBM Cognos Workspace Advanced or Report Studio:


SYMPTOM
The report version "http://developer.cognos.com/schemas/report/12.0/" is not supported. Expected report version "http://developer.cognos.com/schemas/report/11.0/"


CAUSE
Older version of the report may still be in the browser cache.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The above error is an example from 10.2.2 however you may receive similar error messages in other versions of BIA/CWA or Report Studio.

Clear the browser cache and test to see you can open the report.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A more permanent solution is to set your browser's history settings to always load a new page.

IE: 
- Internet options - General tab 
- Browsing history - settings. If it is to "Automatically" change it to "Everytime I visit the webpage" 
- Restart the browser

Firefox:
- in the address bar type in "about:config"
- find the setting "browser.cache.check_doc_frequency" and change it to 1. This will force Firefox to check for a newer version of the page you’re viewing, regardless of the servers instructions, or Firefox’s default settings.
