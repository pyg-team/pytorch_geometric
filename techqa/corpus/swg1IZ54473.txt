ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Microsoft Windows Server 2003
   Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.3
   Nokia based Mobility Client (any)
   
   Scenario:  The Lotus Mobile Connect Connection Manager is set up
   to configure its Mobile Network Interface (MNI) via an external
   DHCP server.  The problem is that Nokia based Mobility Clients
   are not able to log in when using this type of configuration.
   
   Externally the user will see a message that the log in has timed
   out.  Internally, a trace from the Nokia Mobility Client will
   show that the Connection Manager is returning responses from the
   secondary authentication method, which in this case, was Active
   Directory, but the Nokia Client is not recognizing it.  This is
   because the response from the secondary authentication server
   appears to be sent back from a different IP address than it was
   sent to.  Most likely it will be the MNI address of the
   Connection Manager.
   
   The real issue is that to make DHCP work in most cases, LMC had
   to stop aliasing the Network Interface Card with the DHCP
   retrieved MNI address. This causes problems with non-EAP
   clients.  Nokia Clients do not support the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Assign a Private Subnet Address or Private Subnet with NAT MNI
   address.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The reported problem represents a specific configuration of
   using an external DHCP server to configure the Mobile Network
   Interface while also using Nokia based VPN clients which is not
   supported by the Lotus Mobile Connect product.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The conclusion is that this problem report represents a
   limitation of the product and it will not be fixed.
