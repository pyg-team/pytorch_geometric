 Is it possible to monitor the WAS Activation Specifications using the WAS YN agent? 

ANSWER
No, you cannot use the WAS YN agent or the MQ Monitoring agent to monitor the WAS Activation Specifications. You have to use a custom script that will check the activation specifications. An Enhancement Request (ER) has been submitted at this time (3Q 2014).
