ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A call to stored procedure ADMIN_CMD() to describe a SQL result
   set will truncate the output column names after 30 characters.
   
   call admin_cmd( 'describe select IBMREQD as
   VERSION1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 from
   SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1 ')
   
   this returns:
   
   452 CHARACTER   1        0   VERSION12345678901234567890123
   30       0
   
   With DB2 V9.5 identifiers can be 128 character long.
   Since ADMIN_CMD() is based on DESCRIBE OUTPUT functionality
   which has still a 30 character limitation this will be fixed in
   the next release.
