Title: IBM Omnibus install error Wrong Deployment Engine - United States

Text:
DE; singleUser; permissions; multiple installs; non-root install TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During an Omnibus installation, you receive an error that the wrong deployment engine is in use. There is a root global deployment engine and a non-root deployment engine installed on the same server. 

SYMPTOM
You are updating an instance of Netcool/OMNIbus that was installed using
the Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at
"/home/netcool/.acsi_hostname.ibm.com".
However you are now using the DE located at
"/usr/ibm/common/acsi".
Refer to the Troubleshooting section of the Netcool/OMNIbus Installation
and Deployment Guide for possible causes of this problem. Note that you
should terminate this installation and then resolve the problem before
trying again.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the file $NCHOME/omnbius/platform/<arch>/install/install.properties to find the correct Deployment Engine installation for Omnibus

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To prevent the non-root user from using the global deployment engine at /usr/ibm/common/acsi, run the command as root:

/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security -singleUser

This will allow only the root user to use the Deployment Engine at /usr/ibm/common/acsi, and the non-root user will have a separate install of the Deployment Engine in the user's home directory.
