APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Domino 8.5.2
   
   Use settings as follows:
   Server configuration document
   [MIME] tab - [Settings by Character Set Groups] tab
   MIME settings by character set group: Japanese
   Header: Character Set: ISO-2022-JP, Encoding:Base64
   Body: Character Set: ISO-2022-JP, Encoding: None
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Access mail DB via browser
   2. Create new message using Japanese for body
   3. Use Format - Rich Text
   4. Send the message to outbound
   5. In MIME source, there is the description as follows
   
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
   Content-Type: text/html;
      charset=ISO-2022-JP
   
   6. Create new message using Japanese for body again
   7. Use Format - Plain Text
   8. Send the message to outbound
   9. In MIME source, there is the description as follows
   
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
   Content-Type: text/plain;
      charset=ISO-2022-JP
   
   In iNotes 8.5.1 and 8.5.2, Content-Transfer-Encoding is set to
   quoted-printable.
   But if the MIME message is sent from Notes client and Plain Text
   Format with iNotes 8.5.0 or 8.0.2, Content-Transfer-Encoding is
   not set.
   
   ISO-2022-JP is 7bit so it dose not necessary to use
   quoted-printable encoding.

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is associated with SPR# TSHI8JX8V2.
   when inotes sends an html text part with binary encoding, it
    does not include any line breaks.  this fix adds the init
    setting, MIMEInsertHTMLLineBreaks=1, to force the part to be
    7bit encoding and to insert line breaks at appropriate places
    in the html text to insure that the lines do not exceed the
    SMTP line length limit off 998.    previously, we used
    quoted-printable encoding to force line breaks into long
    single line html parts, but some customers were unhappy with
    this approach.
