QUESTION
 How do you install IBM WebSphere Portal or Lotus Web Content Management V6.1 on an IBM i V7R1 operating system? 

CAUSE
WebSphere Portal V6.1.5.1 is the first release of Portal to support IBM i V7R1. The following document describes what to consider when installing WebSphere Portal V6.1.5.1 on IBM i V7R1. The process is to install WebSphere Portal with the 6.1.5 fresh install and then upgrade to 6.1.5.1 by applying the 6.1.0.4 fix pack. Subsequent fix pack service levels will also be supported.

ANSWER
Details: 

 * The first step to install WebSphere Portal on iSeries on IBM i V7R1 is to install either WAS 6.1 or WAS 7 on an iSeries system on which WP V6.1.5 is to be installed. Note that the Application Server install media that is included in WP V6.1.5 does not support IBM i V7R1. The V7R1 install enabled Application Server installer should be used.
