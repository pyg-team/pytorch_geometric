Known Issues in update (firmware 3.9-34) 

- An issue has been encountered with some Proventia 1G NAB appliances that can cause the MAC address to reset to a factory default value after upgrading from the factory default firmware to a newer firmware version. 

To correct this issue re-image appliance to firmware 2.18-43 or higher on top of firmware version 1.0.849. Users who are running a later firmware version and are experiencing this issue will receive an error when installing this patch, they will be advised to revert to firmware 1.0.849 and follow steps just mentioned. To download firmware 849, see the iss.net download center or contact customer support. 

- In some cases, invalid security certificates can be uploaded to the unit. In case the LMI is no longer accessible, the user must login to the unit as the root user through a console or SSH connection, remove all pem files from the flash directory and reboot the unit. 

- Upgrading to 3.9 from 3.4 may cause the root password to change. Upgrading will also break the ability to change the root and admin password from both LMI and admin console. Follow the steps in technote http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672103 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672103] to fix the issue. 

- NTP/TACACS menus have extra options other than enable/disable. These options do not do anything and will be removed in the next release. 

- Bond service is currently not working.
