APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After configuring Case Builder to open Process Designer with the
   IBM Content Platform Engine Applet support plug-in for IBM
   Content Navigator, the Process Designer applet becomes unusable
   when using Internet Explorer as the browser.
   The window for the applet becomes squished to only about 200
   pixels tall, and is not resizable.
   This will happen if you open Process Designer from the Solution
   list page in Case Builder or from the Task Page for a particular
   Case Type.
   
   This problem only affects Internet Explorer.
   Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome does not have this issue.
   
   Actual Results:
   The vertical size of the applet window is squished to about 200
   pixels, making it impossible to view or edit the workflow.
   
   Expected Results:
   Able to use Process Designer without any issues.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround is to open the Solution workflow by going through
   IBM Content Navigator (ICN) directly.
   This can be done after you have followed the steps to configure
   ICN to work with the IBM CPE Applet plugin.
