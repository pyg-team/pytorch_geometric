QUESTION
 Can WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files and Adapter for FTP service descriptions exist in the same module? 

CAUSE
The common schemas in both Flat Files and FTP have the same name. 

ANSWER
The outbound service descriptions for Adapter for Flat Files and Adapter for FTP cannot be generated in the same module if both service descriptions use the same folder to store the generated schema files. 

Both Adapter for FTP and Adapter for Flat Files have schemas with the same name but with different namespaces and elements. The following list of response types have file names common to both adapters: 

 * CreateResponse.xsd 
 * AppendResponse.xsd 
 * OverwriteResponse.xsd 
 * ListResponse.xsd 
 * ExistsResponse.xsd 
 * RetrieveResponseWrapper.xsd


If the response types have business graphs, then response business graph files are also generated for the listed schema files. When you create the outbound service descriptions for the two adapters in the same module, the common schema files generated for the first adapter are replaced with those generated for the second adapter. To avoid this, either generate outbound service descriptions for the two adapters in separate modules, or create the schemas in different folders within the same module.
