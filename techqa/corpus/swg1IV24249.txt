APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On a failover setup with shared NCIM, after running the
   following steps, it caused the backup server to have more
   entities than the primary in the ncimCache.entityData table:
   Follow steps:
   1. Restarted processes on both server
   2. Reduced the scope of discovery and reran full discovery on
   primary server.
   3. Check model's ncimCache.entityData number of entities

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There are multiple problems resolved under this ticket.
   (1) Deletion of implicit entities from model do not propagate to
   the gateway
   (2) Deletion of an entity in the primary model, in
   non-replicating failover
   (a) fails to delete any implicit entities (eg ipEndPoints) in
   the backup ncimCache
   (b) Does not propagate deletions to the backup gateway
