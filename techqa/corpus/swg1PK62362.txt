ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Normally, when selecting a group within the admin? access groups
   menu, a list of all permissions applicable to that user are dis
   played in the lower-left detail pane.  under sqlserver 2005, thi
   s does not appear.
   Steps I used:
   1. Create new db, allow BF to lay down schema
   3. Click on a group (admin? access groups? click on any group)
   4. Observe left lower pane only shows associated items, no permi
   ssion data is visible
