ABSTRACT
 IBM Decision Optimization Center Solutions Accelerator provides components enabling the execution and customization of optimization solutions. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM Decision Optimization Center Solutions Accelerator Client Edition


The client edition consists of the following components: 

 

1. Smarter Planning and Scheduling for Manufacturing (SPSM) 

This component provides the capability to manage configurable solutions for Decision Optimization in the area of planning and scheduling in the manufacturing industries. It supports configurable solutions in the following areas: 

 *  Multi-Site Master Planning in the domain of Production Planning and Scheduling (PPS) Dynamic Project Scheduling in the domain of Complex Project Scheduling (CPS). 

The Solution Workbench, available through an IBM website, is used to configure SPSM solutions. The workbench enables the creation of domain models and technical components that can be configured and assembled into solutions usable with Decision Optimization Center. Solutions can be customized and extended using the APIs from Solutions Accelerator.  

2. Advanced Interactive Gantt 

This visualization component provides an abstract Decision Optimization Center custom Gantt view that greatly reduces the effort required to build interactive scheduling applications. This component extends the Gantt component provided by Decision Optimization Center to add some features not found in the base Gantt component. This component is built using IBM ILOG JViews Gantt (delivered with Decision Optimization Center) and can be extended using the APIs from Solutions Accelerator and JViews. 

 

3. Decision Optimization Center View Utilities 

This component provides a set of utilities to support the execution of custom views provided in the IBM Industry Optimization Solutions, particularly filtered aggregated Chart Views. 

 

4. Data Exchange 

This component provides the capability to define and orchestrate advanced data import and export jobs between Decision Optimization Center and external components. It requires IBM DB2 V9 or V10 (including IBM DB2 Express-C V9 or V10). 

 

5. SPSS Modeler Connector 

This component provides the capability to execute Decision Optimization Center custom tasks based on SPSS Modeler Streams. This component requires IBM SPSS Modeler Client 14.2 or IBM SPSS Modeler Server 14.2, and IBM SPSS Modeler Batch 14.2, or later versions. 

 

6. Support for Microsoft Excel Scenario Source 

This component provides the capability to load Microsoft Excel spreadsheets into a Decision Optimization Center Scenario, or to export Decision Optimization Center Scenario tables to Microsoft Excel. The component uses a structural pattern based on the Decision Optimization Center Data Table Schema to load or export the Excel data. 

This component requires Apache POI version 3.9, which can be downloaded here: http://poi.apache.org/download.html [http://poi.apache.org/download.html] 

The following POI libraries need to be copied to the lib/external [3_8/lib/external] folder of the Solutions Accelerator Client Edition installation directory: 

 *  poi-3.9-20121203.jar poi-ooxml-3.9-20121203.jar poi-ooxml-schemas-3.9-20121203.jar xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar 

7. Decision Optimization Center Customization Utilities 

This component provides a set of utility classes that help with the customization of a Decision Optimization Center application.
