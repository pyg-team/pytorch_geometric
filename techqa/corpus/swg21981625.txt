Title: IBM Issue with creating Entity Analytics repository in Modeler Premium 18.0 - United States

Text:
ICC_PKCS11_ROOT EA entity analytics modeler 18.0 upgrading new version repository creation fails TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am unable to create a repository to be used for Entity Analytics for Modeler 18.0. Whenever I try to create a repository, I get a general repository creation failed error in the Modeler client and then in the EA logs which are found here:

C:\ProgramData\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\18.0\EA\logs
C:\ProgramData\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\18.0\EA\tmp

I see these errors:



[ERROR] || G2Wrapper::callG2WebService |

Failed to start web service on port: 1321, username=administrator



[api_5516_20160321172827:5284] CRIT: CRITICAL

ERROR:

[api_5516_20160321172827:5284] CRIT: {

[api_5516_20160321172827:5284] CRIT:

[EAS-8521E]: Anonymization with a named salt requires the Secure Store

to be initialised.

[api_5516_20160321172827:5284] CRIT: } 

CAUSE
This error is caused by either a missing environment variable called "ICC_PKCS11_ROOT" or if the user attempting to create the repository does not have write permission on the folder defined for the "ICC_PKCS11_ROOT" environment variable. The error will also occur if the "ICC_PKCS11_ROOT" environment variable is pointing to a directory location that does not exist.

ANSWER
New to Modeler 18.0, you must define an environment variable called "ICC_PKCS11_ROOT". Refer to the Modeler Premium Installation guide, page 5 in the section titled "After you install SPSS Modeler Premium". Specifically step 1 which says: 

Add an environment variable called: ICC_PKCS11_ROOT. Ensure that the user you are logged into
Windows as has full permissions on the folder. 

On Windows you can add Environment Variables by right clicking on My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables. Under System Variables click New. Add the variable name ICC_PKCS11_ROOT and set the value to an exisiting directory that he user you are logged into Windows as has full permissions to the directory. 

On a Unix system, follow the steps outlined in our documentation found on the IBM Knowledge Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_18.0.0/modeler_install_prem_project_ddita/clementine/install_premium/post_installation_server.html]
