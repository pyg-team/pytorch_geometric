QUESTION
How can you configure multiple Tomcat instances on the Jazz Team server to run as a service on a single Microsoft Windows platform?

CAUSE
You have one of the Jazz based product such as Rational Quality Manager runs on Tomcat configured as a service in a Microsoft Windows machine. You want to configure another Jazz based product, such as Rational Team Concert installed in the same Windows machine on a different Tomcat instance to run as a service as well.

ANSWER
This technote refers to the Jazz Team server installed under C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzTeamServer. Replace it with the location of your server. 


Follow the steps below to install another service with a different name for the RTC tomcat instance so that windows can distinguish it from the Rational Quality Manager one. 

 1. Bring up a DOS prompt and cd to: C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzTeamServer\server\tomcat\bin 
 2. Execute the following command to install an additional service named tomcat5rtc (you can name it differently): 
    
    service install tomcat5rtc
    
    
 3. Log off and log back on to your Windows system. 
 4. Create a corresponding exe file to bring up the service properties panel for the newly installed service: tomcat5rtc: 
 5. Go back to C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzTeamServer\server\tomcat\bin command prompt 
 6. Run this command: copy tomcat5w.exe tomcat5rtc.exe 
 7. Stay at the same command prompt, execute: tomcat5rtc.exe to bring up the service properties panel, follow steps documented in http://jazz.net/library/article/72configure [http://jazz.net/library/article/72configure] parameters to complete the configuration to have tomcat runs as a Windows service. 
 8. Reboot your computer.


You should now have the two tomcat instances with Rational Quality Manager and the Jazz team server configured to run as a Windows service.
