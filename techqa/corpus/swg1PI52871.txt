APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Modeler 17.0 stream that has a Table Output node and directing
   the contents of this output to a file on the C&DS 7.0 local file
   system rather than the repository.
   
   When this job is executed, it will be successful and the output
   file is created on the C&DS local file system. However, the
   Deployment Manager job step log will also display the following
   message: "No location specified for output Table. Output will be
   discarded.".
   
   This message will appear if the Table Output node of the stream
   is set to 'Output to Screen' or 'Output to file'.
   
   The location of the output file is defined in the Properties >
   Results tab of the Modeler job step. If the stream only contains
   a C5 or Neural Network model and the output (*.gm) is sent to a
   file, this message is not displayed.
   
   The expected behaviour is that this message does not appear for
   a Table Output node when we are re-directing the results to the
   local file system rather than the C&DS repository.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This message can be safely ignored as the resulting file is
   correctly written to the local file system.
