ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are attempting to bring up a CICS TS v3.2 region and it is
   failing to initialize SSL. Reviewing the regions Joblog you see
   the following messages:
   
   DFHME0124 TD is unavailable for writing message DFHSO0123
   to TD queue
   DFHSO0002 A severe error (code X'080C') has occurred in module
   DFHSOSE.
   
   The situation is that DFHSOSE is sending this message of SO0123
   to the specified transient data queue. But the TD queue is not
   available for writing because it is not initialized yet. Also,
   this region contains the DD statement for DFHCXRF which CICS
   uses while the TD is initializing. But, being that the queue is
   not available the request should have been redirected to CXRF
   but that is not happening.
   
   The queue CXRF is only used when TD domain is initializing. It
   gets used as the destination in place of all CICS defined TD
   queues. The situation we have here is that TD hasn't even
   started initialization so message domain cannot call it at all.
   This means CXRF is unable to be used as an alternate destination

   CICS may attempt to issue message DFHSO0123 to CSOO during
   startup if problems occur starting SSL. However, Transient
   Data is not yet active and the message can't be issued. CICS
   instead issues message DFHME0124 to record this problem.
