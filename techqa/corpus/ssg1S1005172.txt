 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects IBM System Storage SONAS 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]
DESCRIPTION: The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.


CVSS Base Score: 7.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
