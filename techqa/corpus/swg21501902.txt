PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am seeing the following error when trying to start my CDC instance

com.datamirror.ts.monitoragent.statistics.MonitorStatisticsPbException Monitoring Statistics database error: A SQL exception has occurred. The SQL error code is '60000'. The SQL state is: ZQ000. The error message is: |Log manager errors. Log record is corrupted. LSN that the log record was read at = 13:14020160. LSN stored in the log record = 0:0. 

CAUSE
Monitor Statistics Pointbase Metadata corruption

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Try to remove the files in the <CDC Install>/instance/<instance name>/statistics directory. They are transient files that will be recreated on startup.
