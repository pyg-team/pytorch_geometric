Text:
Vertical Scroll Bar; Scroll Bar; Cognos Administration; Activities not displayed TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to see the vertical scroll bar in Cognos

When selecting past jobs status from the Cognos

Administration > Status > Past Activities --> The vertical scroll bar

on the right of the screen appears to be hidden.

The vertical scroll bar appears in the Firefox browser. 

SYMPTOM
The vertical scroll bar on the Cognos Administration Page is not visible, although the functionality of scroll remains (when you try scrolling with the scrolling wheel of Mouse).


CAUSE
This issue is normally caused when the Internet Explorer document mode is set incorrectly for the internal websites. For this particular issue, the Cognos Administration Page is pointing to a document mode of IE 7, even though the browser is IE 10. This occurs specifically for internal websites operated by the webserver. For any external websites the the browser document mode is set to the latest document mode ( in this case it was IE 10).
- The problem occurs because the browser document mode is set to IE 7 which is not supported by Cognos (Based on the Cognos Compatibility report).

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Unable to see the vertical scroll bar in Cognos
When you try to check the past jobs status from the Cognos
Administration > Status > Past Activities --> The vertical scroll bar
on the right of the screen appears to be hidden.
- The vertical scroll bar appears in the Firefox browser.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
- The problem is resolved with the use of the Developer tools option(F12) in Internet Explorer. 
- We can then manually change the document mode to the latest document mode ( IE8 and greater) which is supported by Cognos.
- Once we change the Document mode to IE 8 and greater, click on the Persist Settings option in the developer tools.
- The persist settings options will permanently save the document mode setting (force the document mode setting to the new setting).
- In case the persist mode setting is unavailable, you can download the patch for the Internet Explorer from the below link, which will update the IE developer tools setting to include the persist setting option.
- You would have to install the below IE patch which includes the persist
emulation mode setting (which basically means save emulation mode
setting).

This should resolve your issue. Also I checked the Cognos Compatibility
Report, based on which IE standard 7 is not supported, due to which the
side vertical scroll bar is disappeared.

If we can save the document setting to IE 8 and greater, it would
resolve the issue.
