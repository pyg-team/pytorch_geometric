APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error description.
   Example.
   When performing the following set of commands.
   
   SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(BLOCKADDR) ADDRLIST('1.2.3.4')
   
   followed by
   
   SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(BLOCKADDR) ADDRLIST('1.2.3.4')
   ACTION(REMOVE)
   
   The blockaddr.ini file still contains the following entry.
   
   ChlAuth = Enabled
   Warn = No
   Addr = 1.2.3.4
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Edit the blockaddr.ini file manually.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   MQ 7.5 users using SET CHLAUTH command to remove BLOCKADDR
   channel authentication records.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A logic omission in the queue manager channel authentication
   management code caused a failure to update the blockaddr.ini
   file when removing BLOCKADDR records.  This meant that the file
   was not updated when the SET CHLAUTH TYPE(BLOCKADDR) ...
   ACTION(REMOVE) command was issued.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ queue manager code was changed so that BLOCKADDR
   records are correctly removed from the blockaddr.ini file when
   the SET CHLAUTH TYPE(BLOCKADDR) ... ACTION(REMOVE) command is
   issued.
