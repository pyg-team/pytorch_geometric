APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are 4 levels where http session timeout can be set.
   Which one will be picked will depend on the on configuration.
   Many times a session is expiring earlier (or stays alive
   longer) than expected. Users may just look at the server
   level setting while they mistakenly overwrite the setting at
   the ear or war level. A session trace has to be run to
   determine from where the session timeout is picked up.

 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Trace messages from session management  *
   *                      configuration by level requires more    *
   *                      detailed information.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Session manager can set up different configurations
   individually for specific applications and Web modules that
   vary from the Web container default. Trace messages during
   application start up don't provide detailed information where
   the session management configurations are picked up from. That
   is,  Web container level, applications level or Web modules
   level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Trace messages from session management configuration by level
   were modified to include additional details such as overridden
   configuration at either application level or Web modules level.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   WebSphere Application Server fix packs 7.0.0.43, 8.0.0.14,
   8.5.5.12 and 9.0.0.4.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
