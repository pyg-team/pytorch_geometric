APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For example, after you have NACIS (our software) installed, the
   main
   screen
   (Policy Info) has a field called Death Benefit.  On the previous
   version
   (2002) of NACIS it recognized the Death Benefit field, but on
   version
   2003
   it said, "Object was found but is not visible within its parent"
   (I
   found
   this in Test Manager, right clicked on where it failed and
   selected
   Properties).  I tried recording the field and fortunately it did
   not
   shut
   down my computer and I was able to record it.  As you can see
   below in
   the
   third blue line, it says "Undefined=" in the EditBox statement.
   The
   text in
   green represents what version 2002 recognized.  This type of
   situation
   seems
   to only happen on a few Edit boxes.
   
   I can get around the problem now by just inserting "Undefined="
   into the
   selected code but there still is an issue either with our
   software or
   Rational.  I will show this to our developers on Monday to see
   if they
   made
   any changes to fields like this during our last release.
   
   Sub GoTo_DeathBen
   Window SetContext, "Name=frmMain", ""
   'EditBox Click, "Name=ctlPolicyInfo1.txtBenefitAmount", ""
   EditBox Click,
   "Name=ctlPolicyInfo1.txtBenefitAmount.txtNumb;Undefined=", ""
   End Sub
