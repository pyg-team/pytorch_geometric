APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ITM Administrator's Guide does not mention any consequences
   when choosing a supported LDAP server to configure TEPS
   authentication (Active Directory 2000/2003, IBM Tivoli Directory
   Server 6) and then making customizations to parameters for the
   repository in eWAS within ISCLite. Any customizations made
   within ISCLite will be overwritten and cleared any time the TEPS
   is reconfigured.
   .
   The location of the additional information should be placed in
   Chapter 5. Enabling user authentication under the User
   authentication through the portal server->TEPS/e administration
   console section
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To preserve any ISCLite (or manual changes to eWAS XML files),
   choose the LDAP type of other during TEPS configuration. When
   Other is chosen, the repository information is handled by eWAS
   and is not affected by ITM directly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ITM Administrator's Guide does not mention any consequences
   when choosing a supported LDAP server to configure TEPS
   authentication (Active Directory 2000/2003, IBM Tivoli Directory
   Server 6) and then making customizations to parameters for the
   repository in eWAS within ISCLite. Any customizations made
   within ISCLite will be overwritten and cleared any time the TEPS
   is reconfigured.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This has been fixed in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 Fix Pack
   2 Administrator Guide.
