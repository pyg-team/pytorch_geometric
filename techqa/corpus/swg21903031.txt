 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition that is shipped with IBM WebSphere Application Server which is shipped with IBM WebSphere Portal. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
This bulletin covers all applicable Java SE CVEs published by Oracle as part of their April 2015 Critical Patch Update and additional vulnerabilties which affect IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition. There are other advisories included in the IBM Java SDK but WebSphere Portal Server is not vulnerable to them. You will need to evaluate your own code to determine if you are vulnerable. Please refer to the Reference section for more information on the advisories not applicable to WebSphere Portal Server.
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]
DESCRIPTION: Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2015-0488 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0488]
DESCRIPTION:An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2015-0478 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0478]
DESCRIPTION:An unspecified vulnerability related to the JCE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
