QUESTION
 How do you resolve these RPT errors: BWMRT0113W, BWMRT0105E? 

ANSWER

These messages can be observed in the Agent Messages workspace after you upload a new version of a Rational Performance Tester (RPT) script or after you make changes to profiles that run RPT scripts:

BWMRT0105E -- Could not playback profile ...
BWMRT0113W -- Script iteration skipped ...

The workaround for both messages is:

1) Stop the profile in the Application Management Console (AMC) editor before exporting a new version of a script from RPT workbench and before making profile changes.

2) Export the script from RPT again or make profile changes.

3) Wait a few seconds.

4) Start the profile through the AMC editor.

Here is what these messages mean:

BWMRT0105E

Most of the time, an occurrence of the message BWMRT0105E does not imply that an error occurred. This message sometimes displays when you make changes to a profile while scripts associated with that profile are actively playing back. 

In the ITCAM application, the scripts play back in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you submit a modified profile to the RPT playback engine, the engine tries to stop the scripts associated with the profile, load the new profile, and restart the scripts. 

Sometimes running scripts do not get unloaded during this process. If a script is in the process of playing back, the JVM may not honor the request to stop the script -- for example, if a script is in the middle of a process like connecting to a socket, and that process is timing out. In cases like this, the RPT engine generates the BWMRT0105E message. The message says that the new script did not start at that time.

Try stopping the script in the profile before exporting the script to the AMC.

If this workaround does not resolve the issue, verify that the script runtime is supported. Open the <script-name>.zip archive in the ITM_HOME\kt1depot\T3\RPT directory on the T3 agent host. In the archive, open the <script-name>.properties file. The runtimeVersion property identifies the RPT runtime associated with the script. Example:

#Mon May 09 15:55:49 CDT 2016
runtimeLocation=RPTRUNTIMES/7.7.310.v20140912_1709_50559162.zip
runtimeVersion=7.7.310.v20140912_1709_50559162
appl_name=gsPlantsByWebSphere
tests=gsPlantsByWebSphere,
RPTTestType=http
rpt.testClass=test.GsPlantsByWebSphere_Test_A1E5CF87F2851250DA28B36430386237

The RPT runtime version normally depends on the RPT version. When you import existing scripts into a new version of RPT workbench, always run a test on the scripts. Inspect the RPT test log to verify that no errors are identified before exporting the script to the AMC. 

An out-of-suport runtime package is associated with a script in the following scenario. You import a script from an out-of-support RPT workbench. Then, you forget to run a test on the script before exporting the script to the AMC. 

 

RPT Version RPT Runtime Version RPT 8.2.1.2 7.5.412.v20111021_1438 RPT 8.3.0.0 pre-GA 7.6.100.v20120918_1430 RPT 8.3.0.0 GA 7.6.100.v20120928_1519 RPT 8.3.0.1 pre-GA 7.6.102.v20121105_1814 RPT 8.6 GA 7.7.300.v20140624_2212 RPT 8.6.0.2 7.7.310.v20140912_1709 RPT 9.0 GA 7.7.600.v20160122_0931 Additional Troubleshooting

1) In Installation Manager, update the RPT installation and select the following option. Restart RPT workbench. 

IBM Rational Performance Tester Extension for SOA Quality

The absence of this option can create problems when you export scripts and runtime packages to the AMC. The current runtime package is not exported to the AMC.

After you select this option and save your changes, run a test on a new script in RPT workbench and export the script to the AMC -- only if the RPT test log shows that no errors are encountered during the test. The RPT test log must show that there are no errors during a test before you export scripts to the AMC. 

Then, open the script archive in the ITM_HOME/kt1depot/T3/RPT directory on the AMC host. Examine the <script-name>.properties file. Verify that the appropriate runtime package is associated with the script.

2) For ITCAM for Transactions V7.4 FP01 (V7.4.0.1), install the latest Rational integration support package on the RPT host. For example, install Rational integration support from 7.4.0.1-TIV-CAMRT-IF0008.


3) Also, verify that you have installed the 32-bit version of RPT workbench. ITCAM for Transactions does not support the 64-bit version of RPT.

BWMRT0113W

Message BWMRT0113W occurs after you export a new version of an existing script while the script is currently playing back. The T6 agent tries to start a script in a JVM. Using inter process communication, the agent tries to send the script properties through a socket channel to the JVM. If the agent cannot send the agent properties, it posts the message BWMRT0113W.
