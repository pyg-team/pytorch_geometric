Title: IBM IO08673: FORMATTING SOMETIMES DISPLAYS MESSAGES DIFFERENTLY. - United States

APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 * CMVC 15391
   FORMATTING SOMETIMES DISPLAYS MESSAGES DIFFERENTLY. I DID A
   STANDARD IPL WITH KEYSTONE 783 WITH MULTIRECORDER. I AM
   DOING FORMATS FROM BOTH ODU AND COMMAND LINE. I AM
   USING 4 DIFFERENT MEDIA TYPES. SOMETIMES WHEN FORMATTING
   STARTS, THE MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED DIFFERENTLY. THE CORRECT WAY
   IS, "FORMATTING DRIVE P:" CENTERED ON A LINE, AND UNDER THAT,
   LEFT JUSTIFIED, IS THE, "NNN PERCENT OF DISK FORMATTED" LINE.
   BUT I SAW THE FOLLOWING:
   1. FROM ODU: "3FORMATTING DRIVE P:" LEFT JUSTIFIED, PERCENT
   LINE OK. HAPPENED FOR DVD RAM AND ONCE FOR DVD+RW
   (THE SECOND TIME FOR DVD+RW WAS OK).
   2. FROM ODU: "FORMATTING DRIVE" CENTERED ON LINE, FOLLOWED
   BY "P:" ON THE NEXT LINE, RIGHT JUSTIFIED. PERCENT LINE WAS OK.
   HAPPENED FOR A DVD-RW.
   3. CMD LINE: AS MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS DEFECT, WHEN THE
   DVD RAM WAS NOT RECOGNIZED, THEN I DID DIR, THEN FORMAT
   COMMAND AGAIN, THERE WAS NO "FORMATTING DRIVE P:" MESSAGE.
   PERCENT LINE WAS OK. BUT SECOND TEST WITH DVD RAM NOT
   GETTING RECOGNIZED, RESULTED IN THE FORMATTING MESSAGE DONE
   CORRECTLY.
   SEEMS LIKE THE TYPE OF MEDIA WAS NOT A FACTOR. THESE DIFFERENT
   WAYS OF DISPLAYING MESSAGES WHILE DOING A FORMAT P: -L
   HAPPENED SPORADICALLY.
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 * ORIGINALLY THIS DEFECT WAS GOING TO BE RETURNED LIKE HARDWARE
   ERROR, BECAUSE THE 4800-7X3 MACHINES ONLY SUPPORT HITACHI
   HARD DISKS AND THIS TERMINAL HAS A WESTERN DIGITAL, BUT I
   NOTICED THAT THIS CONTROLLER SHOWS A SIMILAR PROBLEM THAT OCCURS
   ON A C42 OR XSERIES.
   .
   WHEN YOU ARE FORMATTING A DVD O CD-RW SOMETIMES THE
   MESSAGES:
   .
   FLEXOS FORMAT VERSION 1.02
   COPYRIGHT (C) DIGITAL RESEARCH, INC. 1985,91
   .
   THESE MESSAGE ARE SHOWED INCORRECTLY. SOMETIMES ONLY THE
   COPYRIGHT MESSAGE IS SHOWN AND SOMETIMES BETWEEN THE TWO
   MESSAGES IS AN EXTRA ENTER.
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 * CHANGED FORMATTING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN BOTH CASES, USING
   THE 4800-743 AND THE C42 OR XSERIES.
