APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The robe-nco-p-mttrapd-ems-6_0
   does not recognise the port parameter in the
   snmpset_p command in rules file instead of using the default
   SNMP port 161. With the following code $opCode =
   snmpset_p($soaServer, ".iso.3.6.1.4.1.2010.1.1.2.0", "i", 1,
   "private", 8001), the probe sends the SNMP set request to port
   161 instead of port 8001.
   This works correctly on an older version of the probe
   (probe-nco-p-mttrapd-ems-3_0).

   The following note will be added to the SNMP GET and SNMP SET
   sections of the SNMP EMS Probe Reference Guide:
   
   When using the snmpget and snmpset commands in the rules file,
   you must include the port number with the IP address of the
   host, preceded by a colon.
   
   Also, the syntax examples will be updated as follows:
   
   
   
   The syntax example for the SNMP GET command will be updated to:
   
   = snmpget( hostname:port, OID, community )
   
   
   
   The syntax example for the SNMP GET command will be updated to:
   
   = snmpset( hostname:port, OID, type, value, community )
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated with the next release
   of Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for SNMP EMS.
