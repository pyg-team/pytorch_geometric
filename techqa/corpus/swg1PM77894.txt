   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * You are attempting to install the IBM SPSS Data Access Pack  *
   * version 6.1 or earlier that was either included with the IBM *
   * SPSS Statistics DVD or downloaded prior to March 2013 on a   *
   * Windows 8 platform.  You receive an                          *
   * installer error message:                                     *
   *                                                              *
   * Installer UI Mode Error                                      *
   * Installer User Interface Mode Not Supported                  *
   * The installer cannot run in this UI mode.  To specify the    *
   * interface mode, use the -i command-line option, followed by  *
   * the UI mode identifier.  The valid UI modes identifiers are  *
   * GUI, Console, and Silent.                                    *
   *                                                              *
   * You are prompted to click OK and the installation fails.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * This problem is caused by a problem with the InstallAnywhere *
   * software used to build the installer.  This issue was        *
   * addressed in a re-built version of the SPSS Data Access Pack *
   * 6.1 SP3 that was posted for download in mid-March 2013.  All *
   * subsequent versions of the Data Access Pack should install   *
   * properly.                                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If you are using the version that came with your IBM SPSS
   Statistics 21 DVD or you downloaded the Data Access Pack
   installer prior to March 2013, please access the software
   download area in the IBM Passport Advantage website and
   re-download the edition you need.
