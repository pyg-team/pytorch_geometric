APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you try to publish Cognos BI cubes in an IBM Business
   Monitor environment that has fine-grained security configured,
   the process might fail if there are more than 1000 users. If
   cubes are published, you might notice a slow response from the
   Cognos BI report when you use the Report Viewer widget, which
   might also be caused by environmental factors (such as machine
   resources) and differences in cube complexity.
   
   PRODUCT AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Monitor
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use groups with fine-grained security to significantly reduce
   the number of users where fine-grained security rules must apply
    to Cognos BI cubes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Cognos BI cube publishing and operations were not optimized when
    IBM Business Monitor fine-grained security was used with a
   large number of users.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be incorporated into a later release that allows
   Cognos BI cubes to publish successfully when fine-grained
   security is used with a large number of users.
