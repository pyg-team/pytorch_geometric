QUESTION
 Does the Tivoli Integrated Portal/WAS support the http header of X-Forwarder-For (XFF) using SNAT? 

CAUSE
The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is an industry standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy, using Secure Network Address Translation (SNAT)

ANSWER
Tivoli Integrated Portal development has not done any testing with that header, but after looking over the technical specifications for XFF (X-Forwarder-For), they don't see any issues using that header, since the XFF header will be inserted at the proxy level.
