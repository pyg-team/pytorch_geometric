   Description of Problem (full details)
   The customer would like to know if IS 4.0SP2 is supported with
   the use of IDMWS 4.0.1 latest patches. It appears that the
   either the compatibility matrix or the revision logs are not
   giving a clear status on this, and the customer isn't in
   position to upgrade Image Services.
   The purpose of the upgrade is to wipe out some issues they are
   having with their previous version of IDMWS.
   This answer is very important for the customer, this is why he
   would like a very clear statement.

   supported with IS 40 SP3.
