APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RFC 2616 section 3.7 says content media type is
   case-insensitive.
   
   TAM v4.1 fixpack 6. Running on Solaris SunOS 5.8, on a
   SunFire280R
   
   Comments from customer.
   ----------------------
   When my cache type is defined as "image/*" and the
   content type coming through is of type, for example,
   "IMAGE/GIF", the file is not cached.
   
   I have created a separate cache "IMAGE/*" and this works.
   
   Can you let me know if this is the expected behaviour, in which
   case I would then have to guestimate cache sizings over case?
   
   
   Email from Chris H (GC engineer) to customer.

   "Hi Donal,
   
   We are taking a look at this today, will let you know what we
   find with this one.  Certainly sounds like we treat it as case
   sensitive from your test results."
   
   
   
   "Hi Donal,
   
   Confirmed, our code does not perform a case compare on these
   definitions.  If you think that this is a problem, then i
   suggest you open a PMR about such.
   
   Thanks
