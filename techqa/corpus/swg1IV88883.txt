APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem occurs when user uploads a canonical catalog of
   the same version as a native catalog. New scanner catalogs are
   not downloaded to endpoints. In result scanner catalogs on
   endpoints do not match the catalog on ILMT/BFI server and
   software components found on endpoints are not recognized by
   the server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be fixed in ILMT/BFI 9.2.5 (and later)
   and will not occur if ILMT/BFI is installed as a new instance.
   This problem may occur in earlier versions of ILMT/BFI or if
   ILMT/BFI has been upgraded from a release earlier than 9.2.5.
   In such a case it is required to upload a newer version of
   catalog and run data import.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   * When you upload the same version of the software catalog that
   * is already uploaded, some software components are not properly
   * recognized. The problem occurs on Windows
   * EXPECTED RESULTS:
   * The problem does not occur.
   * GUIDs of signatures that are used in the catalog-based scan
   * are not regenerated during first update of the catalog after
   * product installation. If you have the BigFix Inventory server
   * installed on Windows and did not update the catalog yet,
   * upgrade BigFix Inventory to version 9.2.5 to avoid the
   problem.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply appropriate update when available.
