 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Search Services index-area fails to create using Administration Console Content Engine (ACCE) or FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) after installing and applying 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003a. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to create an IBM Content Search Services index-area due to the following errors, depending on which CPE Administration interface is used: 

FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM)
An IBM Content Search Services server could not access the Test_Root_Validation_Index index or the directory that contains the index. Message was: IQQD0027E This action type is not supported.

Administration Console Content Engine (ACCE)
IBM Content Search Services could not set the root directory path for the <index-area path> index area. The following specified path for the root directory does not exist in the file system or is not accessible to IBM Content Search Services servers: <index-area path>.


CAUSE
The above mentioned CPE Fixpack requires the following IBM Content Search Services Fixpack
5.2.0.1-P8CSS-FP001.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Unable to create an IBM Content Search Services index-area after having applied Fixpack 3a for Content Platform Engine version 5.2.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fixpack 3 for Content Platform Engine version 5.2 was available for a limited time only and was replaced by Fixpack 3a. If you have applied Fixpack 3a for CPE 5.2, the above mentioned IBM Content Search Services Fixpack need to be applied as well. 

You will know whether or not you have 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003a by reviewing the Content Engine ping-page and looking at the build version: 

5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003 is build version dap520.003.146
5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003a is build version dap520.003.147 

There is no need to re-deploy Content Platform Engine after applying 5.2.0.1-P8CSS-FP001.
