APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The end time of Performance Data Warehouse tasks is not set in
   the database when an instance is terminated. Entries are left
   blank so that tasks still seem active.
   .
   The issue is that when the process instance is terminated using
   the web console or using the API:
   
   tw.system.findProcessInstanceByID(<processId>).abort();
   
   The process instance state goes to "Terminated" and no
   information is recorded in the END_TIME in the View "TASKS" in
   the Performance DataWarehouse database.
   
   
   There are workarounds like using the Process Server database for
   checking the process state but then you can not clean up
   completed instances from the process server database with the
   corresponding issues that this implies.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The end time of Performance Data Warehouse tasks is not set in
   the database when an instance is terminated. This issue occurs
   because a call is not made to log the tracking data when an
   instance is terminated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V7.5.1.1 and V8.0.1.1 is available that
   updates the tracking data when an instance is terminated.
