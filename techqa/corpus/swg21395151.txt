CAUSE
During Object Store creation, the Access Role not created 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
During Object Store creation, the Access Role not created



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Solution: 

- When using Wizard to create an Object Store, need to select the full set of addon extensions. RoleName (Access Roles) will be created with the install of the Workplace Addon Extensions.

- Or if no addon extensions are selected during the object store creation, you can add the set of addoon extentions to the object store after its creation.
