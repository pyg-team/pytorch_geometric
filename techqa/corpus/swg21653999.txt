PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Cannot logon to a Datacap application after migrating from one environment to another. 

SYMPTOM
The "Login failed for user admin on station 1" error is thrown when you try to logon to a Datacap application that has been migrated recently.


CAUSE
DBCopy was used to migrate from one environment to another. DBCopy will copy all the username and password information from one database to the other. However, the same password for the same user cannot be used if the Datacap encryption key is different between the two environments.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are three ways to work-around this problem:
1) Share the same encryption key between the source and target.
2) If you have other Datacap applications (e.g. APT) and you are able to logon to those applications, you can manually change the password stored in us_pass column in the tmuser table of the affected application to the value of the working application (e.g. APT).
3) Use a different authentication scheme such as LLDAP instead of TMA.
