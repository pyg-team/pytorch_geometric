QUESTION
 How do I install the SAP server components for IBM InfoSphere Pack for SAP Applications 8.0.0.0? 

ANSWER
In addition to installing the client and server components of the SAP Pack on the Information Server tiers, you also need to install the following components on your SAP system to use the Pack: 

 * The RFC-enabled function modules for ABAP Stage:  * Z _RFC_DS_SERVICE_V8_0 
    * Z DS_SAP_VERSION_CHECK_V8_0
   
   
 * The RFC-enabled function modules for Delta Extract Stage:  * ZDS_DE_CONFIGURE_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_HIER_EXTRACT_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_HIER_UPDATE_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_LS_CONFIGURE_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_RETRIEVE_DSLIST_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_ROOSPRMSC_CREATE_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_TABL_ACTIVATE_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_TS_DATATYPE_GET_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_UPDATE_CHGE_POINTR_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_VALIDATE_LS_V8_0 
    * ZDS_DE_VALIDATE_TRANS_STR_V8_0
   
   
 * The following authorization roles that can be assigned to users:  * Z-DS-ADM-ALL-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-ABAP-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-BAPI-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-DELTA-EXTRACT-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-IDOC-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-DESIGN-RM-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIM-DELTA-EXTRACT-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIME-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIME-ABAP-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIME-BAPI-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIME-IDOC-V8-0 
    * Z-DS-RUNTIME-IDOC-SERVER-V8-0

Step 1: Uploading the transport request files 

To import the transport request files, you must first copy them to a directory on the SAP system. 

Procedure  1. Log on to the SAP system as a system administrator. 
 2. Copy the transport files provided on the installation medium to the /usr/sap/trans/cofiles and /usr/sap/trans/data folders respectively on the SAP system. The original location of the transport files depends on the SAP version: SAP version Path on installation medium R/3 4.7, Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/R3 R/3 4.6c - 4.7, non-Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/non-unicode/R3 ECC 5.0, Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/ECC/ECC5.0 ECC 5.0, non-Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/non-unicode/ECC/ECC5.0 ECC 6.0 up to EHP6, Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/ECC/ECC6.0/EHP1-6 ECC 6.0 up to EHP6, non-Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/non-unicode/ ECC/ECC6.0/EHP1-6 ECC 6.0 EHP7, Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/ ECC/ECC6.0/EHP7 ECC 6.0 EHP7, non-Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/non-unicode/ ECC/ECC6.0/EHP7 


Step 2: Importing the transport request files 

The SAP administrator can import the transport request files by using one of the following methods: 

Option 1. Importing the transport request files by using the Transport Management System 

Procedure 
 1.  Log on to the SAP system using the SAP GUI as the SAP administrator. 
 2.  Create the development class (package) ZETL with the transport route definition for your environment. You can use transaction SE80 to do this. 
 3.  Enter the transaction STMS. 
 4.  Click Overview > Imports. 
 5.  Double-click the current SID in the Queue column. 
 6.  Click Extras > Other Requests > Add. 
 7.  Select the transport request ID for your SAP system configuration (see the table below) and click Continue. 
 8.  Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the other transport requests. 
 9.  Select the transport request in the import queue and click Request > Import. 
 10. Enter the Client number. 
 11. On the Options tab, set the options Overwrite Originals and Ignore Invalid Component Version (if available) - see screenshot below. 
 12. You may also set these options to make it easier to re-import the transports at a later time: Leave Transports Requests in Queue for Later Import and Import Transport Requests Again. 
 13. Click Continue. 
 14. Repeat steps 9 - 13 for each transport request. 
 15. Verify that the function module and authorization roles were imported successfully by using any appropriate transactions such as SE80 and SU01.


Option 2: Importing the transport request files at the operating system level 

Procedure 
 1. Log on to the SAP system using the SAP GUI as the SAP administrator. 
 2. Create the development class (package) ZETL with the transport route definition for your environment. You can use transaction SE80 to do this. 
 3. Log on to the SAP system as a system administrator. 
 4. Add the appropriate requests to the import buffer by running the following command:
    tp addtobuffer <transport request> <SID>
    For example:
    tp addtobuffer IB1K903958 DD1 
 5. Import the transport requests by running the following command:
    tp import <transport request> <SID> client=<NNN> U1238
    where <NNN> is the client number. For example:
    tp import IB1K903958 DD1 client=800 U1238
    Note: the addition U1238 indicates to set the options shown at steps 11, 12 in Option 1; the numbers indicate the corresponding option order number in the SAP GUI (see screenshot below), which may vary by system, therefore this addition may need to be adjusted by your SAP administrator. 
 6. Verify that the function module and authorization roles were imported successfully by using any appropriate transactions such as SE80 and SU01.
