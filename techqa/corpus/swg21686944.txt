Title: IBM Tivoli Integrated Portal does not start properly - United States

Text:
TIPL2AUTH; TIPL2SEC; start; certificate ; changed; expired; LDAP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After stopping the TIP server, when trying to restart, it cannot be restarted. 

SYMPTOM
TIP server does not start


CAUSE
A certificate has been changed on the LDAP server , which prevents proper authentication of the tipadmin user when trying to start the TIP server. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the startServer.log and systemout log for errors like these: 

Caused by: com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.WIMSystemException: 
CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.CommunicationException: simple bind failed: 
tdbfg.com:636 [Root exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: 
com.ibm.jsse2.util.h: No trusted certificate found]' naming exception 
occurred during processing. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Edit the wimconfig.xml file located under (please take a backup of this file prior to editing):

<TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/wim/config/




and change: 

<config:realms delimiter="/" name="TIPRealm" securityUse="active"> 

to: 

<config:realms delimiter="/" name="TIPRealm" securityUse="active" 
allowOperationIfReposDown="true"> 

2) Then restart the TIP Server. This will allow you to login as with tipadmin, (who is a user in the local file registry. 

3) Once you are able to log in again, you can do a "retrieve from port" against the LDAP server, to load a new signer certificate.
