PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 About twelve minutes after starting ICFM, a warning message is displayed, which indicates that the Subscribe Work Manager thread might be hung. 

SYMPTOM
For example:

[9/17/15 8:40:13:390 EDT] 00000091 ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread "WorkManager.Subscribe : 0" (00000092) has been active for 697447 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.


CAUSE
WebSphere Application Server sends this message to indicate that the subscriber thread has not terminated. This message is as expected since the subscriber is still running. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
