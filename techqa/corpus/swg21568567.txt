 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I receiving the error "CREATE TABLE: permission denied" when creating a table with primary keys? 

ANSWER
When you attempt to create a table with columns that have primary keys, you may receive the following error, even if you have CREATE TABLE privileges: 

CREATE TABLE: permission denied. 

To create a table with a primary key defined, you must also have CREATE INDEX privileges. This is because when you create a primary key, a new index entry is added to the system catalog. Therefore, to create a table with primary key columns be sure to add CREATE INDEX privileges: 

GRANT CREATE INDEX TO {user} ;
