APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Root cause is an IllegalArgumentException from theme code in
   the
   UrlGenerationTag:
   com.ibm.wps.engine.tags.UrlGenerationTag doStartTag EJPEJ0002E:
   An error occurred while executing CreateUrlCommand.
   
   com.ibm.wps.command.CommandException: EJPEJ0013E: Execution of
   CreateUrlCommand failed.
   at
   com.ibm.wps.util.CreateUrlCommand.execute(CreateUrlCommand.java:
   
   310)
   at
   com.ibm.wps.engine.tags.UrlGenerationTag.doStartTag(UrlGeneratio
   
   Tag.java:245)
   at com.ibm._jsp._Default._jspService(_Default.java:1382)
   Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ObjectID is of
   wrong ResourceType!
   
   This causes a locking issue so that subsequent threads that are
   performing data modification (e.g. page layout changes) are
   hung. This is indicated by WAS warning in log file:
   WSVR0605W: Thread "WebContainer : 4" (00000050) has been active
   for 664095 milliseconds and may be hung.  There is/are 1
   thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.
   WSVR0605W: Thread "WebContainer : 7" (0000005c) has been active
   for 619985 milliseconds and may be hung.  There is/are 2
   thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.
