QUESTION
 I am using the debug rule with the XML Manager -> Compile Options Policy on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance but I do not see the HTML output. How do I configure my processing rule so the correct HTML output is produced. 

ANSWER
The following are some steps to take in order to get the HTML output when using the debug rule with the Compile Options Policy: 

1. Ensure there is no Results action after the last Transform action.
2. Set the output context of the last Transform action to OUTPUT.
3. Add a debug rule to the 'Compile Options Policy' of the XML Manager being used by the service.
4. Ensure the probe is disabled on the service. See related technote below.
5. After sending the request to trigger the processing rule, redirect the response message to an HTML file (debug.html) and view the file in a browser.

Sample configuration setup using the "store:///identity.xsl" stylesheet:
1. Create a loopback XML Firewall.
2. In the request processing rule, have only one Transform action (no Results action) that uses the "store:///identity.xsl" stylesheet.
3. Set the output context of the Transform action to OUTPUT.
4. Add a debug rule on the XML Manager -> Compile Options Policy configuration page.
5. Ensure the probe is disabled on the service.
6. After sending the request to trigger the processing rule, redirect the response message to an HTML file (debug-rule-output.html).
7. View the HTML file (debug-rule-output.html) in a Web browser.

Sample cURL command (response is saved to the 'debug-rule-output.html' file):
curl --data-binary @request.xml http://<ip>:<port>/debug-rule-uri >> debug-rule-output.html
