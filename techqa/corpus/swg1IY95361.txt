ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  -------------
   Environment:
   -------------
   ITM 6.1 + FP02
   OS: W2K3
   
   ---------------------
   Problem Description:
   ---------------------
   Customer set up TEPS to use exetrnal web server on his W2K3
   boxes
   He uses IIS V6
   The procedure to correct set up a working IIS is not complete.
   Using the stadnard port 80 for the newly craeted web site
   creates problem.
   Another port shoudl be used.
   Possible cause of malfunction can be the socket pooling.
   I found on MS Knowledge base an article regarding the need to
   disable socket pooling under one of the following conditions:
    1) A low number of sites are being hosted on the IIS server:
     --> currently only one web site at customer place
    2) There are special security concerns
    3) Another application or server has need of port 80
   Details on how to disable it are on:
    http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;238131 [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;238131]
   and
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813368/ [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813368/]
   on IIS 6.0
   
   the official doc needs to be changed in order to reflect that
   port 80 with IIS 6 cannot be sued
   
   -------------------------------
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   -------------------------------
   Follow procedure docuemted on the Installation Guied:
   Chapetr 9 - Configuring an external Web server to work with
   Tivoli Enterprise Porta
   - Paragraph for IIS 6.
   --> it does not work

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use diffeent port than 80 for the web server
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The documenation has been updated as follows:
   
   If IIS is being used as the external Web server for Tivoli
   Enterprise Portal over a firewall, you may experience
   performance problems like slow download times.  Socket pooling
   may also cause problems under certain conditions.  If you
   encounter problems, try using a port other than 80 on the IIS
   server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The update will be included in the next release of the product
   documentation.
