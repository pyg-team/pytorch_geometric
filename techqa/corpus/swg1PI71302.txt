APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I attempted to search for a string which contained a single "("
   that I had cut from an operation within my model using the
   wildcard search.
   
   Using the string as cut from the operation I received no hits
   from the search.
   
   If I replaced a few characters; but not the "(" from the string
   with an "*" I received no hits.
   
   If I replaced the "(" with an "*" or a "?" I received the
   expected hits including the operation from which I cut the
   string.
   
   If I cut the string so it only contained the characters up to
   but not including the "(" I got the expected hits.
   
   The "(" is not a standard recognized wildcard then it should
   search for proper string and give me the search result.
   It would also be helpful if Rhapsody Help contained a list of
   the wildcards it understands.
