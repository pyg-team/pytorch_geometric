PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides information about a problem where system limits are exceeded during SAVLIB. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Limits on saving database files may result in the following messages: 

CPF375E F/QDBSVPRE or F/QSRSVPRE
CPF3797 F/QSRSVPRE
CPF329F F/QDBSVPRE - V6R1 or later
MCH0601 F/QDBSVPRE
MCH1210 F/cblabranch T/QSRSVRQI

Most of these messages arise from filling up an internal object or work area. MSGCPF3797 arises from a network of related files that contain too many internal objects for Load/Dump to handle in a single request.

Some actions that may circumvent these errors are as follows: 

o Display the library on which the save fails. The process of calculating the size of the files may set a bit in some files that will allow subsequent save operations to work.
DSPLIB OUTPUT(*PRINT)
- V6R1 or later o Create a data area that instructs save operations to use a large internal work area.
CRTDTAARA DTAARA(QSYS/QDBSR256M) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(1)
- V7R1 or later, V6R1 with SI31317, V5R4 with SI31316 o Remove some files or members. For example:

- Delete unnecessary files or members.
- Move some members to another file.
- Move some files to another library.
- Archive some files or members. o Use ACCPTH(*NO) on the save command. 
- If this works, it should not be a long term solution. However, it is useful if a good backup is needed urgently, or to collect the customer data for lab analysis. o Split the save operation up into multiple save operations so only a portion of the library is saved in each save operation (for example, SAVOBJ OBJ(A* B* C*, and so on). o Use a different value for the SAVACT parameter.
- V5R2 or earlier only o For SAVACT(*SYSDFN), use different journals for unrelated files.
- V5R2 or earlier only Additional detail regarding CPF375E and CPF3797 

Message CPF375E occurs because an internal object limit has been exceeded for the Save/Restore Descriptor. At R520 and earlier, this error may be issued when using the SAVACT(*SYSDFN) parameter. This error may also be encountered at all releases when ACCPTH(*YES) parameter is specified. The SAVACT(*SYSDFN) parameter usually causes a problem when the user is using only one journal. In this case, all files journaled to that journal are networked together. This network can include many files from libraries other than what was specified in the save command, which causes too much information to go into the Save/Restore Descriptor. When SAVACT(*LIB) is used, the system is concerned only about the objects in the library specified; therefore, the network does not get so large. 

Another parameter that causes problems with the Save/Restore Descriptor is when ACCPTH(*YES) is used. ACCPTH(*YES) causes more information to be built into the Save/Restore Descriptor. ACCPTH(*NO) allows the save to complete, but any subsequent restore takes much longer because all access paths must be rebuilt. Specifying ACCPTH(*NO) should not be a long term solution, but it is useful if a good backup is needed urgently. 

If the CPF375E message continues to be sent from component DB, it is possible the user is trying to save too many objects. This scenario ties itself into message CPF3797, where the save command generates more internal dump operations than are allowed by the system. This is the case where the library has too many internal objects, and a system limit has been reached. 

For information about the CPF3797 limit and estimating the number of internal objects, see the Save and restore limits in the Maximum Capacities information for the corresponding release.
