APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The PureApplication System user added the IBM Business Process
   Manager (BPM) version 8.5.6 cumulative fix 1 to the Installation
   Manager repository.
   
   They tried to apply this fix to a BPM 8.5.6 instance through the
   management console, but the "Maintenance fix packs" field shows
   "Fixpack information is not available".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The method determining if an Installation Manager installable
   fix is applicable to a virtual system instance was not handling
   the special naming case when the fix version does not match the
   traditional V.R.M.F (version, release, maintanance, fixpack)
   numbering convention. In this case the cumulative fix "CF01"
   fix versioning characters prevented proper function.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.1.2.0.
