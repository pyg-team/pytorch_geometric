AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

Principal Product and Version(s) Affected Supporting Product and Version IBM Domino 9.0.0x & 9.0.1x IBM HTTP Server 8.5.5.5 REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM recommends not using the IBM HTTP Server option and instead using "IBM Domino Interim Fixes to Support TLS 1.2" [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/TLS_1.2] "

However, for those customers who have a continuing need to use IBM HTTP Server (IHS), the fix linked below will patch Domino 9.0.1 for Windows with IHS patch 8.5.5.7. There is a W32 and a W64 version that should be used based on the 32-bit/64-bit edition of Domino that is installed. 

Note the following: 

 * Although this fix can be installed on any 9.0.1.x release, it is recommended to install the latest Fix Pack [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037141], 9.0.1 Fix Pack 4 (FP4). This fix can be installed on top of Domino 9.0.1 FP4 and future 9.0.1 Fix Packs with or without hotfixes already installed. 
 * Also, this fix can be installed either before or after a Fix Pack. Adding hotfixes later will not affect the install.

Since TLS support has been added to IBM Domino, customers who have deployed IBM HTTP Server with Domino can now use either the method described in the "Workarounds and Mitigations section" of the security bulletin above or the IBM Domino Interim Fixes to configure the native HTTP stack to help deter these attacks. For more information, consult "IBM Domino Interim Fixes to Support TLS 1.2 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/TLS_1.2]"
