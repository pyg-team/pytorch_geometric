APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Silent Install method to install the TM1 Clients,
   the registry key for Applix (as well as child keys, etc) are not
   created/set in the registry (under My
   Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\).    This normally should
   not be a problem, however when this Silent Install method is
   used to install the TM1 client applications onto a machine where
   Cognos 8 requires it, you receive the following error:
   TM1-ERR-0050 An Attempt to initialize the TM1 API failed
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue can be resolved by using the manual install method to
    install the TM1 client applications required by Cognos 8 onto t
   hose Cognos 8 servers (*instead of* the Silent Install method).
       The following alternative solution (to manually create the m
   issing registry entries) should also resolve the problem.:
    Here are the steps to create that particular registry entry [In
   stallDir] starting with the Applix registry key...       As alwa
   ys when working with the registry, you should make a backup of e
   xisting registry just in case you need to restore it.         On
    one of the target machines (where you have Cognos component ins
   talled that requires the Tm1 client application installed, and y
   ou used the Silent Install method)...       Start > Run > regedi
   t         1)  Navigate to:  My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTW
   ARE\         2)  Right click on "SOFTWARE" and select:  New > Ke
   y       Name this new key:  Applix       To keep things consiste
   nt with how keys would be generated with a normal install...
      With that key still selected, double click the Name ("(Defaul
   t)" ) in the right hand pane of Registry Editor, put a space in
   the "Value Data" field, click "OK", then do it again, this time
   clearing that space out of the "Value Data" field.         3)  R
   ight click on the "Applix" key you just created, and select:  Ne
   w > Key       Name this new key:  Install       To keep things c
   onsistent with how keys would be generated with a normal install
   ...       With that key still selected, double click the Name ("
   (Default)" ) in the right hand pane of Registry Editor, put a sp
   ace in the "Value Data" field, click "OK", then do it again, thi
   s time clearing that space out of the "Value Data" field.
     4)  Right click on the "Install" key you just created, and sel
   ect:  New > Key       Name this new key:  9.0       To keep thin
   gs consistent with how keys would be generated with a normal ins
   tall...       With that key still selected, double click the Nam
   e ("(Default)" ) in the right hand pane of Registry Editor, put
   a space in the "Value Data" field, click "OK", then do it again,
    this time clearing that space out of the "Value Data" field.
         5)  Right click on the "9.0" key you just created, and sel
   ect:  New > Key       Name this new key:  9.0       To keep thin
   gs consistent with how keys would be generated with a normal ins
   tall...       do not clear the "Value Data" field as described i
   n above steps.         6)  Right click on the "9.0" key you just
    created, and select:  New > String Value       Name this String
    Value:  InstallDir       Double click the Name ("InstallDir") i
   n the right hand pane of Registry Editor and enter the "Value Da
   ta".  This will be the path to which the TM1 client application(
   s) were installed, by default:       C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1
