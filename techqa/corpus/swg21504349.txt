Title: IBM Partial values stored in Oracle database CHAR tables - United States

Text:
mqiinfo; partial; oracle; CHAR; sql; BLOB TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using an SQL INSERT command to put an ESQL BLOB into an Oracle database table column of type 'CHAR' and you get unpredictable results from the IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) perspective, such as only part of the value being stored in the table. 

SYMPTOM
Some rows are filled with the first part of the ESQL BLOB value, but the latter part is filled with padding characters


CAUSE
Inserting an ESQL BLOB which contains a null byte (x00) into an Oracle CHAR column results in the string being truncated at that byte and then padded to the correct length with spaces.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Confirm whether any null bytes exist in the input data.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the null bytes are necessary, then there are two possible workarounds:


 1. Use a BLOB type table column to store the BLOB value 
 2. Convert the BLOB value to a CHAR value to store in the CHAR table column.
