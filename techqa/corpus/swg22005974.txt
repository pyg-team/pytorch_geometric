ENVIRONMENT
Modeler 18.1/RMS license manager 8.6.2.3001 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
the versioning of the IBM wrapper to the SafeNet installer into 
agreement with the version if Sentinel, RMS License Manager that we are 
delivering. It's 9.1 all around now.]I believe what you are seeing is a
Client application with licensing components that are newer than the the
License Manager itself. Remember, the License Manager can always 
'downshift' to accommodate prior versions. however, it cannot magically
"upshift" itself to accommodate licensing components/functionality it 
does not have itself

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The customer will need to deploy "IBM Concurrent Licensing 
Tools 9.1"
