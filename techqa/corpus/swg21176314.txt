PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®) toolkit for IBM® Rational® XDE™ is normally installed directly from the web. Users who do not have internet access might need to install it manually. This technote gives a step by step procedure on how a manual install can be done. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are the steps to follow to install the Plug-In manually inside XDE and Eclipse (2.1.x). 

1. Go to a temporary directory such as C:\Temp\MDAToolkit
2. Create 2 folders/directories and call them 
- features
- plugins
3. Download from the following web site the required files in the designated folders
http://www3.software.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/websphere/studiotools/mdatoolkit/UpdateSite [http://www3.software.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/websphere/studiotools/mdatoolkit/UpdateSite] 

 * in features:
 *  com.ibm.xde.mda.fullinstall_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.runtime_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.toolkit_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.uxjsf_[version].jar 
 * in plugins:
 *  com.ibm.xde.mda.help_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.runtime_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.searchDanglersTool_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.toolkit_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mda.uxjsf_[version].jar com.ibm.xde.mdatoolkit.profiletools_[version].jar 
 * 
 * 

4. Finally, copy the file "site.xml" directly under the MdaToolkit directory created in step (same level as folder plugins and features) 

5. Launch Eclipse shell and Open the Install/Update perspective 
(select Help > Software Updates > Update Manager). 
In the Feature Updates view, navigate the ``My Computer`` section to find the directory 
created in step 1, and called MDAToolkit. 
In the folder, you will see a pink diamond called ``MDAToolkit`` containing 
the following updates:  * 
 * MDA Toolkit 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  ->
 *  
 * expand the node and you should see the sub nodes:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  -> select the node to perform installation (see step 5.a)
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * 
 * MDA TooolKit Example 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  ->
 *  
 * expand the node
 * 
 * 
 * -
 * 
 *  -> select the node to perform installation (see step 5.a)
 * 

NB: You might see a node with an older version (like MDA Toolkit 1.0.2) with a red mark. This means that not all the jar where downloaded. Since only the latest version of the puglin should be installed, you can ignore this node. Select only the latest one that corresponds to 
the version of the jar downloaded.

To verify that the installation was successful, go to the Install/Update Perspective 
(select Help-> Software Updates-> Update Manager) and from the Install configuration 
view, verify that the MDA Architect is present and is enabled under the Eclipse installation path. 

You can also verify whether the installation was successful from Feature Updates view. 
Click on Available Updates and then click on the Query Settings hyperlink to see all installed plug-ins.
