PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You see a large increase in Measured Usage Licence Charging (MULC) TCB time for WebSphere MQ for z/OS. This occurs after upgrading to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 or V4.1. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
With CICS TS V3.1 and earlier, all MQ work is performed on dedicated threads in the queue manager (qmgr) address space, and all work on those threads is chargeable against MQ. Starting with CICS TS V3.2, there are changes to the way CICS connects to MQ. MQ work can now run on open transaction environment (OTE) threads that also perform non-MQ work, and this requires a change in where MQ begins and ends collection of MULC data [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqsat.doc/zc13850_.htm].

See MQ APAR PK73461 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK73461] and PM20880 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM20880] (MQ V6) or PK82806 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK82806] and PM22549 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM22549] (MQ V7) for additional details. Apply the PTFs for your release of MQ to fix the problem.

If you are running WebSphere MQ for z/OS V7.0.1, see technote WebSphere MQ for z/OS V7.0.1 migration and installation--important information including highlights of new function [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21406779] that says: 

 * 
 * 
 * MULCCAPT
 * 


MQ 6.0.0 and 7.0.0 need a service parm (provided by the support center for MQ) to activate the function, but in MQ 7.0.1, you can use the MULCCAPT parameter.
