APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is running MQ V7.1 using ACF2 and wants to map
   CLNTUSER(xxx) to MCAUSER(USER1) from ADDRESS
   ('n.n.*.*').    All the CHLAUTH settings below resulted in the
   following error:
   ACF00076 LOGONID xxx NOT FOUND
   
   These are the CHLAUTH settings in customer environment:
    1) SET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(USERMAP)
   USERSRC(MAP) CLNTUSER(xxx) MCAUSER(USER1) ADDRESS('n.n.*.*')
   ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   2) SET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(USERMAP)
   CLNTUSER(xxxx) USERSRC(MAP)
   MCAUSER(USER1) ADDRESS('n.n.*.*') ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   3) SET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(USERMAP) +
   CLNTUSER(xxx) MCAUSER(USER1)
   
   Customer complained the issue "ACF00076 LOGONID xxxx NOT FOUND"
   when doing the translation from CLNTUSER to MCAUSER with that
   the CHLAUTH is TYPE(USERMAP)
   If the user ID is lower case, quotation marks must enclose
   it, for example:
   
   SET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN) TYPE(USERMAP) USERSRC(MAP)
   CLNTUSER('xxx')  MCAUSER(USER1) ADDRESS('n.n.*'.*)
   ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   However, CSQ9013E "+CSQ1 'CLNTUSER' parameter 'xxx' length is
   more than 12" is shown .
   
   The CHIN is passing the long userid which may be up to 64
   characters, when checking CHLAUTH records, but the limit on the
   SET CHLAUTH CLNTUSER parameter is 12 characters which causes
   the problem.
   
   Note that it looks  as though this problem will not occur at MQ
   V8 with NEWFUNC (CLNTUSER may be greater than 12 characters in
   this case).

   ****************************************************************
   On z/OS, the maximum length of the CLNTUSER field when adding a
   channel authentication (CHLAUTH) record was 12 characters.
   However incoming clients were matched against their long user
   ID, not the short user ID.
   This meant it was not possible to correctly map clients which
   reported usernames of longer than 12 characters as it was not
   possible to configure this within the queue manager on z/OS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The maximum length for the CLNTUSER field has been increased on
   z/OS to 64 characters. This is the same length Windows uses,
   and is the maximum length of the long user ID field of an MQMD.
   
   This makes it possible to configure the queue manager such that
   clients reporting user names of longer than 12 characters will
   be correctly mapped.
