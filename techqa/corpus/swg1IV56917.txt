PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary: Monitoring Agent for Linux OS does not have a
   system to disable the monitor on cifs file system in Linux Disk
   attribute group. In order for this APAR to be properly
   implemented in your environment, a new environment variable has
   been added. See the "Install Actions" section of the APAR
   conclusion for more details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new environment variable, KBB_SHOW_CIFS, was added to allow
   the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS to monitor the cifs
   filesystem.  The default value is TRUE.
   
   Install Actions:
   Set the environment variable KBB_SHOW_CIFS in lz.ini with value
   TRUE or FALSE to allow or exclude the cifs file system.
