APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description: Auto deployment of the client may
   fail with the following message.
   
   ANE4252E The setup script failed to start the deployment manager
    as a scheduled task with the Windows "at" command.  Ensure that
   the Windows Task Scheduler service is running. It is possible
   that the system event log contains more details about the
   failure. Reschedule the client deployment.
   
   This is caused by a space in the path used by auto deployment.
   For example "C:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\"
   
   This is a known problem with Microsoft's Schtasks.exe command
   line tool, as documented in KB823093:
   
   http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823093 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823093]
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected: 6.3, 6.4, 7.1
   
   Initial Impact: Low
   
   Additional Keywords: autod, autodeployment, autodeploy, sched,
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make sure "at.exe" command is in your path. The deployment code
   will first try "at.exe", which does not have the issue with
   space in the command line.  Also, the client can be manually
   installed.
