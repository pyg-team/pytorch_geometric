APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Mode is internal to the probe, and is one of "master",
   "slave", or
   "standard" if not using failover.
   
   Summarizing what I discussed in a chat with Steven, this is the
   proposed fix:
   
   1. when master and slave lose contact with each other, the slave
   is
   going to change its internal mode to "master" because it thinks
   the
   master failed
   2. I plan on adding a probewatch event for when the mode changes
   from
   "master" to "slave" or vice versa (Core OMNIbus APAR requested)
   3. I intend for the customer to use the probewatch event to
   clear the
   slave events when the slave probe mode changes back to "slave"
   (i.e.
   they reestablish contact)
   
   This is the simplest and most customizable solution for them -
   they can
   handle the probewatch event however they want in their rules and
   triggers in step 3.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The Local Fix is to Manually Remove Extra Events Created by the
   Ping Probe
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Probes running in slave mode in a peer-to-peer probe         *
   * failover configuration                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Probes running in slave mode cache, and then discard all     *
   * alerts, including ProbeWatch alerts. The ProbeWatch alerts   *
   * report useful status information about a particular probe.   *
   * Therefor the suppression of ProbeWatch alerts result in      *
   * useful information being lost. For example, if a slave probe *
   * is struggling to read its rules file, the end user is not    *
   * informed about it.                                           *
