QUESTION
 Why am I seeing delays when opening images to view in Daeja ViewONE Pro suddenly? 

CAUSE
Local cache growth on client machines can cause performance degradation. You can try clearing up the local cache for ViewONE to see if the performance will be improved. 

ANSWER
In Windows close the viewer first and click Start -> Run. Then type in %temp% and click OK. Window Explorer will pop up showing you C:\Users\<userID>\AppData\Local\Temp, for example. Delete the viewone directory and its content under the Temp directory.
