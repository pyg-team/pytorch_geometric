ANSWER
The function of authentication in Tivoli Integrated Portal is controlled by the Websphere Administration Server component, which supports client certificate authentication. Instructions for configuring client certificate authentication are available here:

Note:
The Websphere document includes a step to edit a file called web.xml. There are many instances of web.xml in a typical TIP installation. For the purposes of configuring client certificate authentication, the following files should be edited:

<TIP HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\config\cells\TIPCell\applications\isc.ear\deployments\isc\isclite.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
<TIP HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\config\cells\TIPCell\applications\isc.ear\deployments\isc\isc.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
