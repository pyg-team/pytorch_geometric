Title: IBM Failed to load shared library using Oracle adapter on Linux - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It should be noted that the ITX 9 Oracle DB adapter has a link dependency on libclntsh.11.1.so on Linux (where on other platforms, such as AIX, the adapter is linked with libclntsh.so which may be a softlink to libclntsh.so.11.1 or perhaps libclntsh.so.12.1). 

SYMPTOM
If the Oracle 12 client library is installed, the ITX map may encounter an 'failed to load shared library' error.


CAUSE
The ITX 9 Oracle DB adapter has a link dependency on libclntsh.11.1.so on Linux 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) maps using the Oracle adapter on the Linux platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using the -T option to create an adapter trace file, the error message 'failed to load shared library' can be seen in the trace, despite the paths and variables being correct.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create softlinks as required so that the correct library can be found. For example, if Oracle 12.2 client library is installed, you would execute the following in the directory where the libclntsh.so.12.2 library can be found:

ln -s libclntsh.so.12.2 libclntsh.so.11.1
