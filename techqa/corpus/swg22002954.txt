Title: IBM ICN rows do not scroll as expected when using the mouse wheel - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Navigator (ICN) rows in Search and Browse views do not scroll as expected when using the mouse wheel. 

SYMPTOM
This issue occurs when working in an ICN desktop, in the 'Search' or 'Browse' views.
After scrolling down to the bottom of the list of documents and then starting to scroll up using a mouse wheel or equivalent, the scroll bar on the right moves up as expected, however the rows do not move up and instead appear to 'twitch' while the selected document remains the same. 

See attached demo for example: 

Scroll Jumping.wmv [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002954&aid=2]Scroll Jumping.wmv [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002954&aid=1]


CAUSE
This is caused by a new switch introduced by Google Chrome v56:
chrome://flags/#enable-scroll-anchoring [crholme://flags/#enable-scroll-anchoring]


ENVIRONMENT
ICN v 2.0.3.8 and ICN v3.0
Client OS: Windows 7/8/10
Google Chrome version 57.0.2987.110 (32 bit)



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This issue occurs only on Chrome browser (v56 or later).
The issue is not reproducible with Internet Explorer or Firefox.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Once the mouse wheel is released, or the view is scrolled to the top the issue resolves itself. 

To resolve the issue permanently for each user, the Chrome flag
chrome://flags/#enable-scroll-anchoring [crholme://flags/#enable-scroll-anchoring]
can be set to disabled.

Note that Chrome flags cannot be set programmatically, so this will need to be performed manually by the user.
