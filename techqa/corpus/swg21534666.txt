error in status report: java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key executeCall; nested exception is: The meta data for Function is not available


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM




It could be because of the data that is returned by sap contains characters that can not be converted back to XML



Verify this by debugging in SAP and see what kind of Fieldnames or Values SAP wants to return and if they contain values that can not be converted into xml like "<" or so.</P><br/><br/><P>if this is the case there is a workaround for that which will escape these characters.</P><br/><br/><P>add 2 entries in the</P><br/><br/><P><installdir>/properties/sap.properties.in like this</P><br/><br/><P>SAP.<AdapterInstanceName>.XMLSpecialCharHandling=Yes</P><br /><br/><P>SAP.<AdapterInstanceName>.XMLNodesSpecialHandling=Yes</P><br/><br/><P> where <AdapterInstanceName> is the Name of the Adapter instance.</P><br/><br/><P>After that stop GIS, run setupfiles and restart GIS, then try again. If this should help, please make the customer aware that the non XML-printable characters are escaped then.</P>
