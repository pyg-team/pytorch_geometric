APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Solaris Global zone is properly discovered, however the
   local zones are not displayed.
   
   The following message can be found in the trace debug logs:
    Could not get IP address for zone
   
   TADDM is using the following command to determine the IP address
   of the local zones:
   
   zonecfg -z gfxldv info | grep address: | awk '{print $2}'
   
   The above command can return no results either because it was
   masked, or because the local zone has exclusive access to the
   network interface, hence the IP address is not known by the
   global zone. For such cases a different mechanism is used based
   on zlogin command. This alternative mechanism can also fail if
   multiple physical interfaces are available. In either case, the
   local zone cannot be discovered.
