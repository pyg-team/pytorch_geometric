APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  USER INPUTS TO BE AVOIDED IN USING BATCH FI
   Expected Result -
   User wants to run the FIRegenerateFormats.sh
   program as a background task to ensure as far as
   possible
   that DMU data (cgr,bounding box,spacemap) is
   uptodate
   Problem/Actual result -
   there does not appear to be any way to do this as
   a background task,since the program always
   prompts
   asking for userid/password/role
   Is there any command-line option to allow the
   userid / password / role to be passed-in ?
   We've tried exporting the
   INTROSPECTION_DAEMON_USERID/USERPWD/USE
   RROLE variables,but these dont stop the prompts
   .
   how can this utility be run in background to process
   an input list of files, without the need for user
   input ?
   I still have not managed to get this job running as
   a batch - it insists on prompting the user for input,
   so I
   think there must be something missing from the
   documentation.
   I'm trying to run the utility with "selection 5", and
   want to give it a file with a list of V_IDs
   .
   What we want to do is run the program from the
   command line,without the need for any operator
   input
   We want to know how this command could be
   written in a way such that it could be added to a
   batch
   schedule-eg in crontab
   .
