Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User tries to use a JAVA-related function (for example UDBR). An error appears. 

SYMPTOM
UdBR (Scenario #1)[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961985&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961985&aid=1] 

Could not create the view ...
Caused by: ..... FAIL:!Java heap space!


CAUSE
The error "Could not create the view" is generic. 

 * There are many possible causes for this error.


Instead, this Technote relates to the scenario where the error message includes the message "FAIL:!Java heap space!"  * Again, there are several possible causes.


Scenario #1 (likely) - This error affects all users simultaneously  * The system was working OK for a long time (for example several weeks) and suddenly all users affected 
 * In this scenario, the cause is that the JAVA Proxy service has run out of memory.


Scenario #2 (rare) - This error affects only one user  * In this scenario, the cause is corrupt/invalid cache files inside the 'bad' user's profile 
 * For more details, see separate IBM Technote #1882560.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Scenario #1 (likely) - JAVA Proxy service has run out of memory. 

 
Workaround:
Restart the Windows service "IBM Cognos Controller Java Proxy" on the Controller application server.

Long term fix:
Increase the memory allocation to the Java Proxy service, by using the file 'CCRProxy.options'. 

 * TIP: For instructions, see separate IBM Technote #1616770.


Scenario #2 (rare) - Corrupt/invalid cache files inside the 'bad' user's profile
