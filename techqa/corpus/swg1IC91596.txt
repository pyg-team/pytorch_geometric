APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user is able to perform a secure-restore on the appliance only
   if the firmware level of the backup files and the current
   firmware level on the appliance match exactly to the fixpack
   level. The current approach to checking the firmware
   version string does not allow the user to perform a
   secure-restore on an appliance running a debug build of the
   same fixpack level. This is due to the fact that the version
   string of the debug build will contain a suffix, e.g. 5.0.0.5ky,
    which will not match the firmware level on which the backup was
    created, e.g. 5.0.0.5.

   The version
   string of a debug build contains a suffix, e.g. 5.0.0.5ky,
