PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The MS SQL server and the monitoring agent is installed, but the agent configuration cannot discover the MS SQL instance on the host. 

SYMPTOM
When configuring the MS SQL agent, the MS SQL server is not discovered.


CAUSE
The MS SQL Server is not compatible with the agent.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The most common reasons why the agent is unable to discover the MS SQL instance are the following:


 * The bit level of the monitoring agent and the SQL server are not compatible. Following combinations are valid:
   both are 32bit 
   or both are 64bit
   or the agent is 32bit and the MS SQL server is 64bit 
 * The version of the SQL server is not supported with the installed version of the agent.
   Check the OQ_LocalConfig.log to see if the agent is finding the correct SQL server, for example:
   SQL Server 2008 is Not Installed. hkey_options:0 
   SQL Server 2005 is Not Installed. hkey_options:0 
 * The userid running the agent must be SQL server authenticated having sysadmin rights.
