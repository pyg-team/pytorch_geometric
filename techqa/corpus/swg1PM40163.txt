ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PE58520-F007
   After applying PTF UK58520 for APAR PM16626 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM16626] , CICS VR users
   which heavily perform batch logging to DASDONLY logstreams
   can experience a performance slowdown in their batch jobs
   following message:
   .
   DWW838I date time A TEMPORARY ERROR CONDITION OCCURRED DURING
           SYSTEM LOGGER OPERATION IXGWRITE FOR LOG STREAM
           &hlq..UNDOLOG . SYSTEM LOGGER RETURN CODE 00000008
   REASON CODE 00000868
   .
   If a logstream is temporary unavailable at VSAM batch logging,
   CICS VR expands internal buffers in the CICSVR address space
   to keep REDOs and UNDOs.  In some cases this can lead to extra
   wait time.
