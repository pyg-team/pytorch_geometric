ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When saving, users are prompted to login to RQM when a module is
   opened in Read-only mode and then switched to Edit mode; No
   changes have been made to any RQM links or any attempt made to
   follow them.
   
   If you choose not to login to RQM, DOORS DXL Errors as listed
   below would be displayed.
   
   Prerequisite for reproducing this issue:
   --------------------------------------------
   In a Jazz RQM project, there is a test plan with a Requirements
   Collection Link to a DOORS module or a DOORS module view. At
   least one test case was created in RQM from a DOORS Requirement
   using the Reconciliation of the Requirements collection.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   ------------------------
   1.? Make sure that the prerequisite is met. Open the
   aforementioned Module first in Read Only Mode.
   
   2.? Switch the Edit mode of the Module to Exclusive Edit or if
   its setup for sharing, you can open it in Shareable Edit Mode.
   
   3.? Make changes to an Object, say add or modify Object Heading
   or Text. i.e. the changes made are not related to any of the RQM
   links or attempts to follow such links are performed.
   
   4.? Click on Save icon or File - Save.
   
   5.? You would observe a DOORS OAuth login page to login to Jazz
   RQM is displayed. If you decide not to login, the following DXL
   error message is displayed in the DXL Interaction window:
   ==========
