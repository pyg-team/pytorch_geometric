Title: IBM Documentation update for Datacap Desktop - Binding panels to DCO types - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The following Datacap version 9.0 documentation explains how to configure tasks for Datacap Desktop. You configure the graphical user interface panels to be displayed for each Datacap Desktop task when you create the task, or when you upgrade the task from Taskmaster 8.1. 

CONTENT
You bind batches or pages (DCO types) to panels when you create a task or reconfigure a task to use with Datacap Desktop. You configure the task settings by using Datacap Web Client or Datacap Navigator.


Configuring Datacap Desktop tasks 

Complete the following steps in Datacap Web Client or Datacap Navigator to configure a new task or an existing task when you upgrade from DotScan or DotEdit in Datacap 8.x. 

To configure a Datacap Desktop task by using Datacap Web Client: 

 1. Log into the application and select the Administrator (Workflow) tab. 
 2. Click on + to expand the Workflow and Job tree that contains the former DotEdit or DotScan task that you want configure and select the task. 
 3. Ensure that the Program selection is set to Datacap Desktop, Rulerunner or Multiple to allow Datacap Desktop to run that task. 
 4. Click on the Setup link. 
 5. Scroll down to the Datacap Desktop section. If the Datacap Desktop section is displayed, skip to step 6. If the Datacap Desktop section is not displayed, recreate the settings as follows.  1. For an upgrade from Datacap 8.x, record all of the settings or capture the screen so you can re-enter them. In particular, record the settings under DotScan and DotEdit because you will transfer the panel binding in this area to the new Datacap Desktop settings. 
     2. Close the settings and change the Program drop down selection to another value. 
     3. Click OK to clear the settings. 
     4. Change the Program back to the original or to the desired value (Datacap Desktop, Rulerunner, or Multiple) and click OK. 
     5. Go back to step 4.
    
    
 6. Enter the DCO type (Batch or Page name) in the Panel for field. 
    
    For example, enter Main_Page to perform verification on each document that begins with a Main_Page in the document hierarchy. 
 7. In the next field, enter the DLL name and the panel class name of the panel separated by a period. 
    
    For example, enter dcDTlib.DataEntry to display the Universal (field-at-a-time) verify panel, or enter DotEditPanels.APT_Main to display the APT verify panel, when a Main_Page is selected. See the Binding Scenarios section below for more information.


To configure a Datacap Desktop task by using Datacap Navigator:  1.  Log in to Datacap Navigator and click the gear icon in the left pane to open the Datacap Administration View. 
 2.  Click on Workflows. 
 3.  Select the Workflow Name that contains the task that you want to configure and click Edit. 
 4.  Select the Jobs tab. 
 5.  Select the Job that contains the task to configure and click Edit. 
 6.  Select the Tasks tab. 
 7.  Select the task you want to configure for Datacap Desktop and click Edit. 
 8.  In the General tab, select Datacap Desktop, Rulerunner or Multiple in the Program field to allow Datacap Desktop to run that task. 
 9.  Select the Advanced tab. 
 10. Scroll to view the Datacap Desktop section. If the Datacap Desktop section is displayed, skip to step 11. If it is not displayed, you must recreate the settings as follows.  1. Record all of the settings or capture the screen so you can re-enter them. In particular, record the settings under DotScan and DotEdit because you will transfer the panel binding in this area to the new Datacap Desktop settings. 
      2. Select the General tab. 
      3. Change the Program drop down selection to another value, then change it back to the desired selection (Datacap Desktop, Rulerunner, or Multiple). 
      4. Go back to the prior step 9.
     
     
 11. Configure the setting titled Bind DCO Type to Panel. 
     
     For example, enter Main_Page to perform verification on each document that begins with a Main_Page in the document hierarchy. 
 12. In the next field, enter the DLL name and the panel class name of the panel separated by a period. 
     
     For example, enter dcDTEdit.DataEntry to display the Universal (field-at-a-time) verify panel, or enter DotEditPanels.APT_Main to display the APT verify panel whenever a Main_Page is selected. See the following Binding Scenarios section for more information.


Binding Scenarios To convert DotEdit task settings from Datacap 8.1: 

 1. All settings in the Bind DCO Type to Panel section can be copied unchanged to the Datacap Desktop setting of the same name. 
 2. The page type must be listed first followed by the panel name. If the panel name is entered without a DLL name, Desktop assumes the panel name is DotEditPanels.


To convert DotScan task settings from Datacap 8.1:  1. In the DotScan section, go to the single setting named User Interface Panel. The original value may be Default (Rulerunner), ISISScan, TWAINScan, or a custom value. Default is the Rulerunner panel. 
 2. For Datacap Desktop you can set the Panel for field to Default and the panel to the corresponding values: dcDTlib.rulerunner:B, DotScanPanels.ISISScan:B, DotScanPanels.TWAINScan:B. 
    Alternatively you can set Panel for explicitly to the batch type (instead of Default) and set the panel name without the suffix :B.


In general you bind DCO types to standard panels as follows:  * Bind one or more page types to Verify panels to run verification tasks on a page. 
   
   For example, in the Panel for field, enter Main_Page and in the next field enter dcDTlib.dataentry to display the Universal field-at-a-time index/verify panel. Enter DotEditPanels.APT_Main to display the specialized verify screen for Invoices. 
   
   To add another binding for subsequent page types, click on the + icon next to Bind DCO Type to Panel in the settings screen. 
 * Bind the batch type to a panel like DotScanPanels.VScan, DotScanPanels.ISISScan, or DotScanPanels.TWAINScan to run scanning or fixup on batches. 
   
   The batch type is frequently the same as the Datacap application name and the Workflow name. In Datacap Studio, the batch type is the second item listed in the Document Hierarchy, next to an icon that displays a stack of pages. 
 * Bind the batch type to the Rules panel dcDTlib.rulerunner to run Rulerunner recognition tasks on a batch. 
 * You can use an alternate method of binding.
   
   Instead of entering the specific DCO Type in the Panel for field, you can enter Default. Then you enter the panel name followed by :B or :P to bind to any batch type or any page type. 
   
   For example, Panel for Default and dcDTlib.rulerunner:B, or Panel for Default and APT_Main:P 
 * Bind any page type to the Universal (field-at-a-time) data entry panel for verify tasks.
   
   You can leave the Bind DCO Type to Panel settings empty, or leave the place holder settings Panel for DCO_TYPE and DLL.Panel. When Desktop does not find any valid binding it uses the Universal verify panel bound to all page types.
