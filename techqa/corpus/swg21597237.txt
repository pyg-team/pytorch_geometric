Title: IBM Unable to open file in Taskmaster Web with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
verify unable open file TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On exiting Verify in Taskmaster Web, an error is displayed stating:


unable to open file C:\Datacap\(application)\batches\(batchname)\ 

SYMPTOM
There will be no filename listed as part of the error, and the error may be repeated.


CAUSE
The rrCopy action was used to copy from a batch level field to a field located at some other level in the DCO hierarchy. This action also brings across underlying properties, including the imagefile property. Taskmaster Web attempts to locate the file specified in that property, then generates an error since the value is blank.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the rrSet action instead. This copies only the value of the field without bringing across the underlying properties.
