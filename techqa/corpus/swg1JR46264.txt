APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Breakpoints in a mediation flow do not cause execution to stop.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No work around is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  As IID moved up to RAD 8.0.4.1, the RAD debug target class has
   changed. When we attempt to hook up our debugger to the server,
   the debug target is no longer the one we are expecting. As a
   result, we fail to register ourselves which causes our debugger
   not functioning.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed  the code in the new debug target class that RAD
   provides. This
   problem was already fixed in 8.0.X. The fix has been provided
   to IID 7.5.1.X.
