QUESTION
 Can ITAM for J2EE v7.1.1 monitor the Hogging Thread Count in WebLogic? 

ANSWER
Hogging thread in WebLogic are potential candidates for stuck threads or threads that "might" get stuck. These threads will be declared "stuck" after StuckThreadMaxTimeout seconds which defaults to 600 secs. If the thread gets released by the request before this timeout, it won't be termed as a hogging thread anymore and will be released to the available thread pool.

This Hogging thread count is maintained by the WebLogic admin console and is seen as a decimal value. Currently, ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1 cannot monitor this count inside the TEPS via means of a pre-defined Situation but if you suspect a Hogging thread, you can get a Java thread dump from the MS console. So, while we don't support monitoring this hogging thread count, if you are using the Managing Server console, you can take a thread dump from there and view the stuck threads.

If you find the stuck threads may be valid, you can consider increasing the timeout or increasing the thread pools.
