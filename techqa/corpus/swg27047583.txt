 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this document is to describe how to perform in a Windows 7 SP1 machine the following: 
- Install the standalone MQ Client 7.5 (SupportPac MQC75). This will be the Primary installation.
- Install the standalone MQ Client 8.0 (SupportPac MQC8).
- Install the standalone MQ Explorer 8.0 (SupportPac MS0T).
- Apply maintenance to the MQ Client for a Fix Pack for 7.5 and 8.0.
- Replace the MQ Explorer with the latest level (because you cannot apply maintenance to this component).
- Finally, uninstall all these components. 

CONTENT
The order for installing the MQ Client is very important. 

The first one to be installed, will be Installation1, the second one will be Installation2.
If you want the MQ Client 8.0 to be Installation1 then you will need to install it first.

The installing of the MQ Explorer is not related to an existing or non existing MQ Client installation. Thus, MQ Explorer can be installed first, and then the MQ Client, or the MQ Client can be installed first and then the MQ Explorer.

There are 9 scenarios covered in the document:

+ Baseline:
The baseline is a pristine machine from the point of view of MQ.
There are no installations of any kind of MQ in the machine.
