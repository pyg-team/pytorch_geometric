APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When there are following setting on the remote server:
   
   Database manager authentication        (AUTHENTICATION) = CLIENT
   Alternate authentication           (ALTERNATE_AUTH_ENC) =
   NOT_SPECIFIED
   Cataloging allowed without authority   (CATALOG_NOAUTH) = YES
   Trust all clients                      (TRUST_ALLCLNTS) = YES
   Trusted client authentication          (TRUST_CLNTAUTH) = SERVER
   Bypass federated authentication            (FED_NOAUTH) = NO
   
   in that case when the user and password is provided then
   authentication should take place on the server side.
   When no credentials are provided then client authentication
   should take place.
   However instead the following exceptions are raised:
   
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlWarning: Origination unknown:
   [10228][11541][4.18.60] Security exceptions occurred while
   loading driver. ERRORCODE=4223, SQLSTATE=null
   
   and:
   
   [jcc][t4][201][11237][4.18.60] Connection authorization failure
   occurred.  Reason: Security mechanism not supported.
   ERRORCODE=-4214, SQLSTATE=28000
