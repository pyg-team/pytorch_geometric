Getting background information on EJBDeploy 

 All Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE ) EJB applications go through an EJB deployment phase in which your application is customized to run in an application server. Typically, this is accomplished by a deployment tool that is specific to the application server. It generates code to allow your EJB to run within an EJB container. Some application server products' deployment tools alter the bytecode of your application classes rather than generating code ;however, the end result is similar. 

The EJBDeploy Tool 

Historically, EJB deployment in the Application Server product has been performed by the EJBDeploy tool, which is included with WebSphereÂ® Application Server and packaged with the development tools for the WebSphere products. 
The EJBDeploy tool inspects the external interfaces for your enterprise beans, generates wrapper code as .java files, and compiles the code using the javac compiler. The resulting .class files are packaged in your EJB module with your application code. For modules including and previous to EJB 2.1, the EJBDeploy tool must be invoked manually. 
Please note that in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x and below, the tool can only deploy Java EE applications compiled with a JDK level of 7 or below. To deploy JDK 8 compiled web applications, please upgrade to WebSphere Application Server V9.
