ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying a decision service from Business Console 8.7.1.1,
   
    from a snapshot, we get the exception below.
   The issue happens when we close the RuleApp Archive Creation
   dialog box with the  "Close and view report"  button, however
   the ruleapp archive can be downloaded before closing the wizard.
   
   Deployment from a branch or from Rule Designer is also
   successful.
   Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException:
   ilog.rules.teamserver.brm.impl.IlrSnapshotImpl incompatible
   with ilog.rules.teamserver.brm.IlrBranch

   com.ibm.rules.decisioncenter.web.core.deployment.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the report is displayed there is an explicit cast of the
   baseline used to generate the deployment to the class IlrBranch
   which is not compatible with the class of a baseline of type
   snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
