 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed in March 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM MessageSight. IBM MessageSight has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0209 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0209] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the d2i_ECPrivateKey or EVP_PKCS82PKEY function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101674 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101674] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

 

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0288 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0288] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the X509_to_X509_REQ function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a NULL pointer dereference. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0289 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0289] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle missing outer ContentInfo by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blob to trigger a NULL pointer dereference. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0292 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0292] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error when processing base64 encoded data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted base 64 data to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101670 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101670] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

 

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0293 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0293] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially-crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671] for more information
