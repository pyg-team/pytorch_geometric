APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Create a UCD Component Template, source type likely
   irrelevant
   (problem seen with None & Maven).
   2. Go to template Processes and
   create at least one, process type(s) irrelevant (problem seen
   with 1 or more processes and with all types).
   3. When a "Run
   Component Process" step is added, attempting an export of that
   Template will fail with a null pointer exception.
   
   Export of a
   Component based on that template as well as an
   Export of an Application with a Component based on that template
   will fail in the same way.
   
   Export of a Component having a
   process with a "Run Component Process" step but is not based on
   a template has not been seen to fail.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * External symptoms: Attempting to export a configuration      *
   * which contains a process with the "Run Component Process"    *
   * step fails. It only fails when the secondary process is a    *
   * template process.                                            *
   *                                                              *
   * Internal cause: While creating JSON for the Run Component    *
   * Process step, if the process was a template process there    *
   * would be a Null Pointer Exception when trying to retrieve    *
   * the name of the attached component (because there are no     *
   * attached components for component templates).                *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.0 stream (but being released with 6.0.1). After fix
   is applied, exporting will work as intended.
