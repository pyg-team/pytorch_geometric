APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WebSphere MQ 7.1 and MQ 7.5 Information Centers say in topic
   "sc14440_.htm":
   WebSphere MQ >
   Reference >
   Administration reference >
   MQSC Reference >
   The MQSC commands >
   SET CHLAUTH
   + begin quote +
   WARN = YES
   This record operates in warning mode. Any inbound connection
   that matches this record and would therefore be blocked is
   allowed access.
   An error message is written and, if channel events are
   configured, a channel event message is created showing the
   details of what would have been blocked, see Channel Blocked.
   + end quote
   .
   However, there are no error messages written into the MQ queue
   manager log, but a channel event is generated.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users who are testing their channel authentication definitions
   by using the WARN administrative option may encounter this
   problem.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The documentation for the WARN attribute of the CHLAUTH
   command says that if WARN is set to YES then a message is
   written to the MQ error logs when a connection would otherwise
   have failed because of the CHLAUTH settings. The code does not
   behave in this way and no error is written.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A design decision was made during the development of the CHLAUTH
   command not to write to the error log if WARN is set to YES as
   the intention was that users would enable event messages in
   order to test their security configuration. Unfortunately the
   design documentation did not reflect this change in approach and
   so the published documentation did not correctly reflect the
   behaviour of the code. The documentation will be changed to
   remove mention of the MQ error log being updated when a
   connection attempt matches a CHLAUTH rule and WARN is set to
   YES.

   documents this problem and includes a workaround for the case
   where users would prefer the error log to be updated when WARN
   is set to YES and a connection attempt matches a CHLAUTH rule.
