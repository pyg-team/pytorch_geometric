APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With SPSS Statistics 19 FP1 installed with JP UI and OLANG
   (Output Language) on a Mac 10.5.8 machine, printing any output
   to a network post-script printer using IPP (Internet Printing
   Protocol) will crash the application.
   
   Doing the same process on a Mac 10.6 machine will not cause this
   crash.
   Switching SPSS Statistics to EN UI and OLANG mode will not cause
   this crash.
   
   Mac Crash logs indicate the following thread failing:
   
   Thread 32 Crashed:

LOCAL FIX
 *  This has been reported to the IBM SPSS Statistics Development
   team for investigation. It has been discovered that SPSS
   Statistics 19 has not been tested on a Mac OS 10.5 operating
   system. Statistics 19 is only supported on Mac OS 10.6 and
   above. The SPSS Statistics development team has been informed
   that current documentation states that 10.5 is supported,
   however this is a mistake and has been resolved in later
   releases of SPSS Statistics.
   
   Temporary workaround is to switch to another language for your
   output, such as English.
   
   However, a more permanent fix would be to upgrade your Mac
   Operating System to 10.6.
