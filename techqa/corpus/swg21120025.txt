PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Steps describing how to change the appearance of Rational RoseÂ® 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. TO CHANGE BACKGROUND COLOR AND TEXT:
a. From your home directory, cd to windows. For example, on my
machine, my home directory is /people/sasghari and i have a
windows directory here at /people/sasghari/windows

b. To change the background color of windows inside the Rose GUI: 

 Window=R G B 

where R(ed), G(reen), and B(lue) can be values from 0 to 255 

[default value is 255 255 255 (white) ] 


c. To change the text color within Rose:
WindowText=R G B 

where R(ed), G(reen), and B(lue) can be values from 0 to 255 

 [default value is 0 0 0 (black) ]


d. Save and exit from win.ini


* The changes will take effect the next time you bring up Rose.

2. TO MODIFY FONT-SIZE AND COLOR:
[a]. Launch Rose and go to Tools > Options
[b]. Under the General tab click the Font button for the appropriate 

settings (either "Default Font, "Documentation Window Font", or "Log Window Font") 

c. Choose the appropriate color and size
NOTE: once this is changed, it will only affect any newly
added items on diagrams.
Once the above settings have been set, they will remain
each time you launch Rose.
