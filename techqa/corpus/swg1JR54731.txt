PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be incorporated into an IBM BPM V8.5.6 cumulative fix
   and later release that provides a new parameter to ensure the
   URL to static assets contains a build number to prevent the
   browser from showing stale content. The build number is
   generated when the fix is being built and then placed in a file
   that is accessible at run time from a common Java utility.
