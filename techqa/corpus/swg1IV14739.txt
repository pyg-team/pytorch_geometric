ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In ITCAM for Transactions 7.3, RPT 8.2.x scripts do not report
   the Violated Value and Expected Value when a content
   verification point failure occurs.
   
   A failure event displays in the Robotic Script Verification
   Point Failures workspace, but the Violated Value and Expected
   Value columns are blank.
   
   The trace-robotic log includes an entry like the following:
   
   [date-time] -  MIN  - server-name - PlaybackThreadPoolWorker-255
   -
   com.ibm.tivoli.transperf.playback.rpt.RPTPlaybackService.process
   StatusEvent() - Sending RT VP event: i=|0|,
   statusEvent=|SimTestStatusEvent Values:
   monitorName=|monitor-name/|,URL=|application-url|,eventType=|com
   .ibm.rational.test.lt.ContentVP|,eventId=|event-id|,parentEventI
   d=|parent-event-id|,ownerId=|owner-id|,text=|Content
   verification point failed.  One or more content element checks
   failed.|,name=|Content verification
   point|,actualValue=|null|,expectedValue=|null|,eventVerdict=|2|,
   eventReason=|2|,eventDesc=|null|, eventProperties = [
   [name=|Condition|,type=|String|,value=|Fail if any string is
   missing|]  [name=|Missed0|,type=|String|,value=|Actual:
   search-string-value|] ]|
   
   A special case exists where the Violated Value and the Expected
   Value cannot be captured, because the HTTP response was
   incomplete. In this scenario, the trace-robotic log includes an
   entry like the following.
   
   [date-time] -  MIN  - server-name - PlaybackThreadPoolWorker-34
   -
   com.ibm.tivoli.transperf.playback.rpt.RPTPlaybackService.process
   StatusEvent() - Sending RT VP event: i=|16|,
   statusEvent=|SimTestStatusEvent Values:
   monitorName=|monitor-name/|,URL=|aplication-url|,eventType=|com.
   ibm.rational.test.lt.ContentVP|,eventId=|event-id|,parentEventId
   =|parent-event-id|,ownerId=|owner-id|,text=|Unable to determine
   content verification point because a complete HTTP response
   wasn't successfully received.|,name=|Content verification
   point|,actualValue=|null|,expectedValue=|null|,eventVerdict=|2|,
   eventReason=|2|,eventDesc=|null||
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Rational changed the event properties that ITCAM for
   Transactions 7.3 relies on to populate these values starting in
   RPT 8.2.0. The 'Expected' property was changed to 'Condition'
   and 'Actual' property was changed to 'Found0'. The resolution is
   to add code to ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 to check for these new
   properties.
   
   A fix is planned to be included in ITCAM for Transactions 7.3
   FP01.
