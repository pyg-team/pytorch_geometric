Title: IBM "Error 500: ReportRequestProcessServlet Failed to process.." when running BIRT reports in Maximo 7.1.1.5, Websphere - United States

Text:
500 error; 500; ReportRequestProcessServlet; TPAEREP TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I see the 500 error message instead of the BIRT reports when executed from Select Action-> Run reports menu in Maximo? 

ANSWER
After an upgrade from an older Maximo version 7.1, and when running BIRT reports (in version 7.1.1.5) from Select Action>Run reports menu, all users receive "Error 500: ReportRequestProcessServlet Failed to process..". 

In the Websphere log, you will find the following error message:"...SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception thrown in one of the service...ReportRequestProcessServlet Failed to process request" 


Solution:

1) Open applications/maximo/maximouiweb/webmodule/WEB-INF/birt/platform/launch-webapp/launch.ini 

2) Change the 4th line from "osgi.parentClassloader=fwk" to "osgi.parentClassloader=boot"

3) Rebuild and redeploy the maximo.ear file.

4) Test reports by running them from the Select Action>Run Reports menu.
