APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You dump mq objects from a remote queuemanager with the command
   dmpmqcfg like this:
   
     dmpmqcfg -m <localQMGR> -a -r <remoteQMGR>
   
   When the MQ Telemetry package has been installed on the REMOTE
   queue manager this generates an event on the LOCAL queue manager
   where the dmpmqcfg command is being issued. The event being
   generated is about opening the SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using dmpmqcfg to dump remote queue manager configuration
   using a local queue manager with MQXR component installed on
   both the local and remote systems.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A logic error in the dmpmqcfg tool meant that PCF requests made
   by the dmpmqcfg command were not correctly forwarded to the
   SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE on the remote queue manager.
   
   This meant that dmpmqcfg would either incorrectly report MQXR
   information from the local queue manager (if MQXR was installed
   locally), or report no MQXR information as part of its output.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The dmpmqcfg tool has been modified so that requests for MQXR
   configuration from a remote queue manager are correctly routed
   to that queue manager.
   
   In order for this operation to be successful, this fix must be
   applied to both the local installation where dmpmqcfg is being
   run, and the remote target queue manager.
