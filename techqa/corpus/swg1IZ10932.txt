   The InstallShield Wizard has successfully installed Tivoli
   Federated Identity
   Manager - Update Installer. Choose Finish to exit the wizard.
   
   
   
   
   
   It has been noticed that the only time that the failure occurs
   is if TDI 6.1 is installed first and then ITFIMUI
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Run TFIMUI's installer. It will fail but before it fails it
   will lay down and configure the necessary software to install DE
   and to register TFIM 6.1.1 in the DE database.
   2. Execute /opt/IBM/FIM/DE/si_inst.sh. This will install DE 1.3
   using the Java 1.4.2 configured by TDI 6.0.
   3. Execute /opt/IBM/FIM/DE/test/install.sh. This will register
   TFIM 6.1.1 in the DE database.
   4. Follow the directions in the TFIM Technote "TFIM 6.1.1 Update
   Installer may fail for future fix packs" to manually make the DE
   use Java 1.5.
   5. Install the fix pack.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On a system with TDI 6.1 already installed, the
    install of ITFIMUI may fail with the error message "Deployment
   Engine Installation Failed!".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is expected to be cont
   ained in the following maintenance delivery vehicles:
   | LA interim fix | 6.1.1-TIV-TFIM-LA0004
   | fix pack | 6.1.1-TIV-TFIM-FP0005
