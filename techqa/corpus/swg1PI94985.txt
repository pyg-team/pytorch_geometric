APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XSLT() function not working when run under IIB.
   
   This issue is similar to that described in APAR PI35144 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI35144] but for
   IBM Integration Broker (IIB) instead of Sterling Integrator
   (SI).
   
   The cause of the issue is similar, in that the dtxxmlfin.jar
   file needs to be part of the CLASSPATH before the IIB
   environment is started.
   
   Newer installers of ITX for Integration Servers will add the
   appropriate line into the dtx_wmqi_64.sh setup script.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ITXCQ - ITX00058596
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: The dtxwmqi_900_64.sh can be updated to include
   the dtxxmlfin.jar file in the CLASSPATH in the same place where
   m4java.jar and others are added.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender customers who integrate with IIB and
   use XSLT function
   
   Problem Description:
   XSLT() function not working when run under IIB integration
   
   Platforms Affected:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
