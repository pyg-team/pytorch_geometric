 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While deploying the project, Receiving error: -java.net.UnknownHostException 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The appliance data IP was set up on the Internet but not the intranet and therefore was not able to access the DNS server within the DMZ. As a result, the appliance was unable to resolve the hostnames.
To fix this issue, the data IP was moved to the DMZ where it can now access the DNS server, and thus resolve the hostnames.
