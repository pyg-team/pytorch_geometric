ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Semaphores are not release when job is manually cancelled.
   Jobs that are configured to run with semophores will not release
    the semaphore if they are cancelled manually.
   Semaphore will appear as 'inactive' under the Jobs-?Semaphores i
   nterface until manully removed.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   - Create a project with several steps working with a semaphre an
   d sleep command.
   
    Step 1 - .semget Test
    Step 2 - .sleep 60
    Step 3 - .semput Test
   
   - Start project
   
   - After Step 1 has completed and while Step 2 is running the .sl
   eep command, cancel the job.
   
   - After jobs has been labeled as canceled, verify if the Semapho
   re is still present under the Jobs-Semaphore interface.
   
   
   Expected result:
   
   Semaphore for canceled jobs should be removed
   
   Actual result:
   
   Semaphores from canceled jobs are still present in the engine, h
   angging/failing any other jobs that will use the same semaphore.
   
   Workaround:
   
   Remove semaphore manually via Jobs-?Semaphores
