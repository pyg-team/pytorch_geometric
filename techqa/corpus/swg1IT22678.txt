APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem affects users of the IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern
   Type V8 who use single instance MQ pattern deployments where MQ
   logs and data are stored on a shared filesystems such as GPFS
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX, Linux on x86-64
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a pattern was deployed for a single instance Queue Manager
   using the "Use existing MQ queue manager data directory" option,
   /qmgrs/ was incorrectly added to the MQ configuration path,
   which invalidated the location of the MQ log and data
   directories.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern Type scripts have been
   modified to ensure that /qmgrs/ is no longer added to the MQ log
   and data directory path for single instance Queue Manager
   pattern deployments which use the "Use existing MQ queue manager
   data directory" option
