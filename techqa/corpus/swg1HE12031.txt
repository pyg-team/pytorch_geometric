ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When navigating between hold notice templates and matter hold
   notices page and back to hold notice templates the template
   content is populated with hold notice content.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There is a way that you can navigate from an open legal hold
   notice to a hold notice template, where the content of the hold
   notice template will show as if it were the hold notice content.
     Further, if you were to edit and save the content, you could
   accidentally overwrite the hold notice template content with the
    hold notice content.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.6.
