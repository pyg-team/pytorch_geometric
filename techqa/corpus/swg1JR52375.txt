   ****************************************************************
   The IBM BPM deployment environment configuration allows you to
   specify customized names for the service integration (SI)
   buses, but the profile upgrade code assumes a default bus name
   (BPM,<deName>.Bus or the legacy bus names like
   PROCSVR.<cellName>.Bus) has been used.
   The IBM BPM configuration code will be enhanced in a later
   release to include validation of the bus names to avoid this
   error.
