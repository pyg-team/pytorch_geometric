AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM InfoSphere BigInsights: 2.0-3.0.0.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
For version 3.0, and 3.0.0.1: Upgrade to the fix pack version InfoSphere BigInsights 3.0.0.2 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+BigInsights&release=3.0.0.0&platform=All&function=all]. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all affected versions of InfoSphere BigInsights, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3. The server SSL configuration should be modified to use SSL protocol TLS as shown below to disable SSLv3.

The following steps should be performed to disable SSLv3 and enable TLS:


 1. Login as a BigInsights admin user. 
 2. Stop the console: $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/bin/stop.sh console 
 3. Update the console configuration file:  1. Find ssl configuration element in $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/console/wlp/usr/servers/waslp-server/server.xml. 
     2. Add attribute sslProtocol="TLS". 
        For example: <ssl clientAuthenticationSupported="true" id="defaultSSLSettings" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLS"/>
    
    
 4. Restart the console: $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/bin/start.sh console
