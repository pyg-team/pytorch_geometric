APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a list variable bound to a table is evaluated to be empty
   in a validation script and the validation framework is set to
   show a message to indicate this state, the validation error does
   not show.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The validation on the table was removed with interim fix JR56592 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR56592]
   because
   -If there are 50 cells in a table, each having a validation
   error, 50 validation errors would show below the table, which
   would be too a long list.
   -The table being only a container, it's not necessary to have
   validation errors to display at the table level; they should
   just be isolated to the cells.
   
   We did not consider the use case highlighted in this APAR
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that re-establishes the capability to display validation markers
   on the Table, not only the cells within it.
