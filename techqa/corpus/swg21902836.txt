PROBLEM
Receiving Mixed Content Errors with the IBM Connections Forums Portlet in IBM WebSphere Portal.

The Forums portlet shows Mixed Content Errors in the console of the browser in Google Chrome and Firefox.

Internet Explorer works fine.

SYMPTOM
The problem is that upon clicking on the "Previous" or "Next" links in the Forums portlet, the following error is received:

"Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested and insecure XMLHTTPRequest endpoint 'http://...'. This
request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."

and the portlet keeps loading without going to either the Previous or Next pages.



CAUSE
One customer that reported this issue was running an older version of the IBM Connections Portlets For WebSphere Portal.

Page Navigation in the Forums portlet was failing for Chrome and Firefox due to changes performed by the Web Browsers Providers/Vendors, which affected how https pages containing http resources are loaded. 

The problem doesn't happen in IE.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update to the latest version of the Connections portlets from the IBM Collaboration Solutions catalog [https://greenhouse.lotus.com/catalog/] in order to resolve the issue.

The following document contains information for how to update from a previous release
