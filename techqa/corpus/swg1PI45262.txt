APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You will see a message similar to the following in the log of
   the engine:
   
   File "/usr/lib/heat/ibm-sw-orch/heat/ucd/ucd_sw_deploy.py, line
   570, in handle_create
     self.create_or_update_deployment(True)
   File "/usr/lib/heat/ibm-sw-orch/heat/ucd/ucd_sw_deploy.py, line
   681, in create_or_update_deployment
     response =
   self.client.exec_component_process(self.component_name,
   environment_id, self.resource_id, self.process, self.version,
   {})
   File "/usr/lib/heat/ibm-sw-orch/heat/ucd_client.py, line 90, in
   exec_component_process
     response = self.put(rest_url, request_body_as_string)
   File "/usr/lib/heat/ibm-sw-orch/heat/ucd_client.py, line 461, in
   put
     response.raise_for_status()
   ...
   HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request
   
   The message states that the component process
   name in the HOT template does not match the component process
   name in UCD.
   
   Better validation should exist to detect the mismatch.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Verify that the name of the component process in UrbanCode
   Deploy and the HOT templates are matching
