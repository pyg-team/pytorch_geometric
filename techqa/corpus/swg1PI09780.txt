ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to use Packaging Utility to copy packages from Passport
   Advantage may result in no packages being displayed in the GUI.
   
   Problem:
   
   When you attempt to use Packaging Utility in wizard mode to copy
   packages from Passport Advantage, you may encounter an issue
   where none of the packages you are entitled to appear in the
   content list for selection
   
   Steps to reproduce
   -------------------
   1) Launch Packaging Utility in wizard mode;
   2) Click on 'Copy packages';
   3) Enter your IBM ID when prompted
   
   
   Expected results: once the Passport Advantage repository has
   been read and information retrieved, all entitled software
   packages appear in the content selection list
   
   Actual results: some or no packages appear in the content
   selection list after reading from Passport Advantage repository
   
   Local fix:
   
   Use the Packaging Utility command-line (pucl) interface instead
   to copy packages from Passport Advantage.

   ****************************************************************
   The IBM Packaging Utility graphical user interface behaves
   erratically  when a repository digest, the repository.xml
   file, does not accurately reflect the contents of the
   repository.  In addition the Copy wizard waits a long time
   to read the full details (the offering jars) for all
   packages before displaying them to the user.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A change was made in the 1.7.2 IBM Packaging Utility to
   display the digest information first, and only display the
   detail information when the user clicks on a package.  This
   change more closely matches the behavior of the IBM
   Installation Manager.
