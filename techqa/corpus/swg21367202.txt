QUESTION
Where can I find and download the 64 bit or 32 bit issWASPlugin_http.dll file needed to use Microsoft IIS Server as a front-end machine for Domino HTTP?

CAUSE
The file no longer ships with Domino servers and must be downloaded from the WebSphere Application Support site.

ANSWER
Find and download the correct files from the WebSphere Application Server Support site [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/support/].
