APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The certificate extension for SubjectKeyIdentifier is not
   correctly read from the certificate if the certificate key
   length is greater than 1024 bites.
   
   Simulation Steps
   To reproduce this bug:
   - import the certificate(s) into the trusted store
   - import the BPML
   - update the ENCRYPTION_CERTIFICATE parameter* to use one of
   these certificates
   - find the base64 encoded Subject Key Identifier value in the
   service  (example
   X509SubjectKeyIdentifier">ncOh1UEPEHr6JFG25VMhQlDOkiw=</wsse:Key
   Identifier>) and decode it by using an online tool such as
   http://tomeko.net/online_tools/base64.php [http://tomeko.net/online_tools/base64.php]
   - compare this decoded value to that in the actual certificate.
   You will see that the certificate with 1024 bits is correct but
   2048 and 4096 are not correct.
