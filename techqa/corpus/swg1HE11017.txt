APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After moving from CommonStore for Lotus Domino to IBM Content
   Collector, IBM Content Collector Legacy support always needs
   user to input password to start CSLD task, even if the password
   for CSLD user was already saved in one file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workaround for this problem is to start the retrieval tasks
   manually from command line and provide the password
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After moving from IBM CommonStore for Lotus Domino to IBM
   Content Collector, IBM Content Collector Legacy support always
   required the user to input a password to start the CommonStore
   for Lotus Domino task, even if the password for the CommonStore
   user was already saved in a file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, the saved password is read correctly, so
   that the user does not need to input the password again if it
   was saved in a file.
