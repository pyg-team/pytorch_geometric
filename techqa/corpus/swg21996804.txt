Title: IBM Guardium monitoring mysql database connection with compression - United States

Text:
guardium; mysql; compress; sgate; terminate; sqlyog TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Mysql connection can be made using mysql network traffic compression option.
Does Guardium support monitoring these connections?
Is there any known mysql client that uses compression?
What behavior will I see if I try and monitor these connections?


CAUSE
Mysql --compress option is used to set this. From the mysql manual [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-command-options.html#option_mysql_compress]: 

Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression


ANSWER
Guardium does not support monitoring mysql client to server connection using compression. 

At the time of writing the only known client that uses compression by default is 'SQLyog'. The compression option can be turned off in SQLyog by deselecting "use compressed protocol" on the connection screen. 

The exact behavior can vary in different cases. For example you might find: 

 * Missing SQL statements. 
 * Missing user names. 
 * SGATE termination does not work, even in closed mode. 
 * Other policy actions are not triggering as expected.
