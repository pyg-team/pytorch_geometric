ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Linking a Test Case to a requirement fails in IBM Rational
   Quality Manager (RQM) when module is open in IBM Rational
   DOORS(DOORS) and Link discovery is used.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Make sure Link Discovery is enabled in DOORS.
   2. Create a module in DOORS and create several requirements
   under it. Save.
   3. Open the  module in exclusive edit mode in DOORS.
   4. Create a Test Case in RQM.
   5. Go  to Construction > Test Cases and locate the Test case
   created in step 4.
   6. Click on "Add Requirement Link" from pencil icon  under
   "Validates Requirements" column and select a requirement  from
   the module that is open in DOORS.
   
   Expected result:
   The requirement link is created successfully on the Test Case.
   
   Actual result:
   An Error is displayed to the user
   "The link cannot be saved because its target cannot be updated
   at this time."
   Error CRCRW5113E A lock could not be acquired because an
   existing lock is held on the module. The module has been locked
   by <user> since <time>
