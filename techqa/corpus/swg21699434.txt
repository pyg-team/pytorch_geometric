Text:
WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection GSkit FREAK SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection. The GSKit that is shipped with WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection contains multiple security vulnerabilities including the “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapter Collection 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Download and install the interim fix for APAR PI37030 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Transformation+Extender&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=PI37030] from IBM Fix Central. 


You should verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If the Interim Fix for PI29359 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Transformation+Extender&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=PI29359] has already been applied, then there is a mitigation: 

You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues

In WebSphere Transformation Extender V8.4.1.1 and V8.4.1.2, either themercssl.dll module or the m4gskssl.dll module controls cryptographic strength, depending on your configuration. (See Supported cryptographic protocols [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVSD8_8.4.1/com.ibm.websphere.dtx.launchagent.doc/concepts/c_event_agent_Suppported_Cryptographic_Protocols.htm?lang=en] in the WebSphere Transformation Extender Launcher Agent documentation for details.) 

 * If the mercssl.dll module is in use, use the WTX_MERCSSL_PROTOCOL_DISABLE environment variable to specify which encryption protocols to disable. 
 * If m4gskssl.dll module is in use, use the protocol_disable option in the dtx.ini configuration file to specify which encryption protocols to disable.


Configuring the WTX_MERCSSL_PROTOCOL_DISABLE environment variable 

When the mercssl.dll module is in use, configure the WTX_MERCSSL_PROTOCOL_DISABLE environment variable as follows to disable SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1 encryption protocols on Microsoft® Windows® systems: 

set WTX_MERCSSL_PROTOCOL_DISABLE=7 

Configuring the protocol_disable option in the dtx.ini configuration file 

When the m4gskssl.dll module is in use, use the protocol_disable option in the dtx.ini configuration file to disable SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1 encryption protocols: 
1. Edit the install_dir/dtx.ini configuration file. 
2. In the [SSL_CLIENT] and [SSL_SERVER] sections, specify following. The secure_mode option must be set to 0.
