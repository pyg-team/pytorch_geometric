Title: IBM SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE environment variable versus CommuterMaxLife property within spssprod.inf - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed SPSS Statistics versions 18 and 19 with network licenses on Windows Client computers. For version 18 I created an environment variable SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE to control the maximum number of days a commuter license can be checked out for Statistics 18 users. I set the value to 15 days for example.
On my Statistics 19.x network installations I defined the value for maximum number of days a commuter license can be checked out within the file spssprod.inf in installation directory of version 19 on the Client computer. The CommuterMaxLife property setting is set to 30 days.
However, when I start the commuter check out dialog of version 19 I cannot check out the license for 30 days. When I enter 30 and press the check out button I get a message:
"30 is invalid. Please enter a number between 1 and 15"

Why has the CommuterMaxLife property setting no effect? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available. It is addressed with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0 FP2 such that CommuterMaxLife property of version 19 will not be affected by the environment variable SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE.

Currently, when you have an existing SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE environment variable defined on the Client computer this value takes effect also for version 19 independent of what is defined in spssprod.inf for CommuterMaxLife property. 
When you have no existing environment variable on the Client computer the CommuterMaxLife property is the value which have to be set to control the maximum number of days to check out a commuter license for IBM SPSS Statistics 19.
As a workaround please set both properties (Environment Variable and CommuterMaxLife) to the same value.
