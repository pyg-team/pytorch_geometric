APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Incase of multiple NICs the first IP in the list of NICs is
   chosen for
    managed IP inside TPM. The name of VST and the vm that gets
   deployed
    from VST should be different and current implementation doesn't
   allow
    both to be same.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none
   The doc that need to be updated for both statements,
   1. VM name to be deployed should be different that the VST name
   this needs to be updated here in below page
   https://tpmdocb.romelab.it.ibm.com/tpm72r/index.jsp?topic=/com.i
   bm.tivoli.tpm.scenario.doc/virtual/scom_part3.html [https://tpmdocb.romelab.it.ibm.com/tpm72r/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.tivoli.tpm.scenario.doc/virtual/scom_part3.html]
   2. "Incase of multiple network interfaces The first one has been
   marked as management interface ",
   this needs to be updated here in below page, I suppose the below
   should be done from VMware code, let me know if you need further
   details.
