APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Maintenance Forecasting (CM) application not giving results
   
   Environment:
   Websphere 7.0.0.15
   Maximo Asset Management 7.5.0.7
   Maximo Asset Configuration Manage 7.5.1.1
   Maximo Service Providers 7.5.3.0
   Maximo Transportation 7.5.1.0
   IBM ICD 7.5.3.0
   Operating System: Linux
   
   Concerns/Problem:
   Maintenance Forecasting application not giving results
   Maintenance Forecasting hangs when I click 'Forecast Now'.
   
   The hang only happens on the Maintenance Forecasting (CM), not
   on any other applications. No matter we enable LDAP or not, the
   issue always exists.
   We didn't modify the XML file
   The plusamntfo.xml in the demo is exactly same as the one in our
   Maximo env.
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue:
   Go to Maintenance Forecasting (CM) application, open an existing
   record or create a new record.
   From the select action menu, click 'Forecast Now'.
   Application does not give results, but hangs.
   
   From the Systemout.log file, I can see one thread is hung which
   is caused by the Maintenance Forecasting (CM). The thread dump
   (javacore) has the same information.
   00000002 ThreadMonitor W   WSVR0605W: Thread "WebContainer : 5"
   (0000003e) has been active for 777746 milliseconds and may be
   hung.  There is/are 1 thread(s) in total in the server that may
   be hung.
   
   From the Systemerr.log file, I found the below error.
   0000003f SystemErr     R BMXAA4176E - Attribute COMPANY does not
   exist. Gather the logs from the <HOME> directory and determine
   the process or app referencing the invalid attribute.
   0000003f SystemErr     R Invalid attribute 'COMPANY' specified
   for control 'results_showlist' in app 'PLUSAMNTFO'
   
   I checked the Maintenance Forecasting (CM) app table
   (PLUSAMNTLFO), there is no attribute/column COMPANY. But this
   attribute is used in the application xml file PLUSAMNTFO.
   
   Business Impact:
   The business is being affected by the issue. They are not able
   to use this application.
   
   Current Erroneous Result:
   Maintenance Forecasting application not giving results
   
   
   Expected Result:
   Maintenance Forecasting application should give results without
   any problem.
   
   
   Action taken:
   Raised the issue to ACM experts and product manager.
   The product manager confirmed this is an ACM issue.
   
   Action Plan:
   Create APAR. The developer will investigate the issue and create
   fix for the APAR.
