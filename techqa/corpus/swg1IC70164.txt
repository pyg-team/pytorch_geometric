APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Application Server (WSAS) was migrated from V6 to V7
   and is using the Resource Adapter shipped with WSAS. A WebSphere
   MQ (WMQ) Listener in WSAS fails to establish a session with WMQ
   V6 since the upgrade.
   
   This problem would not be seen when connecting to a V7 queue
   manager. It is also only seen when security credentials (user
   name/password) are supplied when creating the JMS connection.
   
   Symptoms include:

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ resource adapter in
   WebSphere Aplication Server, creating a bindings mode connection
   to a V6 queue manager on z/OS.  The PROVIDERVERSION property is
   set to 'unspecified' and a user name and password are set on the
   connection factory.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   This problem was caused by caching the object used to create a
   bindings mode connection to a queue manager.
   
   When the PROVIDERVERSION on the connection factory is set to
   'unspecified', the client first attempts to connect in V7 mode,
   causing the cache to be initialised.  When the V7 mode
   connection fails, the client tries connecting in V6 mode.  The
   cached object is reused but is not suitable for this type of
   connection, resulting in a NullPointerException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Caching of the version-specific bindings mode connection object
   has been removed, which avoids trying to use a V7 mode object
   when connecting to a V6 queue manager.
