Title: IBM Errors accessing IWS v8.6 conman or composer as a non-twsuser LDAP user - United States

Text:
eWAS; AD; authenticate; unable; AWSBEH029E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Workload Scheduler (IWS) v8.6 correctly authenticates the primary twsuser, but other LDAP users receive errors attempting to launch conman or composer command line interface (CLI). 

SYMPTOM
Errors returned: 

AWSBEH021E The user "twsops" is not authorized to access the server on host "127.0.0.1" using port "31116". 
AWSBEH029E The SSL connection using OpenSSL Toolkit with the server fails.


CAUSE
Though the embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) may have been successfully configured to authenticate against Microsoft Active Directory LDAP for the twsuser, some other users may be set up to authenticate against a different LDAP server.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update eWAS with the correct LDAP server for the other users. With IWS v8.6, this involves including the other LDAP server as an additional entry in the Federated Repositories. 


After eWAS is updated with the new LDAP server, within the home directory of the other user, rename the .TWS/useropts_maestro file. Then, attempt to access conman or composer. This will prompt for a user name and password. After entering the user's name and password, you will be asked:

Do you want save the user name and password in your "useropts" file (enter "y" for yes, "n" for no)? 

The useropts file can then be saved (enter "y") and the user should authenticate.
