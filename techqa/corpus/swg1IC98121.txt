APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating a digital certificate, you can specify several
   attributes that are now supported for use with MQ version 7.1
   and 7.5, however, if an SSLPEER value is specified on the
   receiving end of a channel that contains a UID or USERID
   attribute, SSL Peer matching fails and the connection is
   rejected by the queue manager.
   
   The UID and USERID attributes are not properly evaluated from
   the incoming certificate and the native OID (Object
   Identifier) value is seen by the queue manager instead.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  remove UID from the SSLPEER attribute value on the channel
   definition
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of MQ who use SSL enabled channels.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Algorithm that parses the SSLPEER value wasn't parsing the UID
   or USERID attribute correctly. Due to which SSL Peer matching
   fails and the error "rrcE_SSL_UNMATCHED_PEERS" was seen at the
   receiver side during SSL Initialization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SSLPEER parsing algorithm was updated to handle UID or USERID
   attribute correctly.
