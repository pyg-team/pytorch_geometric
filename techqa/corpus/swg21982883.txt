 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on December 3, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool. IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-3193 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3193]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain private key information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108502 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108502] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1794 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1794]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when a client receives a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a segfault and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539] for the current score
