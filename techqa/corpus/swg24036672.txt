ABSTRACT
 SupportPac CC05 provides a refresh of CICS Transaction Gateway (CICS TG) Applet Runtime application programming interfaces (APIs) 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The default security configuration for Javaâ„¢ 7 running in a browser changed significantly in the January 2014 Critical Path Update [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html] (Oracle 7u51, IBM 7 SR6-FP1).


When running CICS Transaction Gateway (CICS TG) API applications in these Java environments: 

 * All Applets and Web Start applications must be signed with a certificate from a trusted authority. Self-signed certificates are not accepted. 
 * All JARS must have the Permissions attribute set in the JAR Manifest.


Applets or Web Start applications that do not meet these conditions will not run in the new default Java 7 configuration. The conditions can be relaxed by moving the security slider in the Java Control Panel to Medium (from the default of "High"), but this is not recommended. 

Any other JARs running as part of Applets and Web Start applications also need to have the Permissions attribute set in the JAR Manifest and be signed with a certificate from a trusted authority. 

The following PTFs and fix pack provide ctgclient.jar files that have the Permissions attribute set and is signed with trusted CA certificates from Symantec 1:  * CICS TG for z/OS V9.0 APAR PM99430 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM99430], PTF UI11855 
 * CICS TG for z/OS V8.1 APAR PI07029 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07029], PTF UI13476 
 * CICS TG for z/OS V8.0 APAR PI07029 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07029] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07029], PTF UI13475 
 * CICS TG for z/OS V7.2 APAR PI07075, PTF UI13477 
 * CICS TG for Multiplatforms V7.2 - APAR PI07057 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07057] Fix pack 7.2.0.5 
 * CICS TG for Multiplatforms V9.0 - APAR PM98651 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM98651] Fix pack 9.0.0.2 
   


1Symantec Root CA for all SSL and Code Signing products enrolled after October 10, 2010. 
1Symantec Intermediate CA Certificates: Code Signing Certificate. 

To provide the same functionality to CICS TG for Multiplatforms V8.0, and V8.1 customers, this SupportPac provides ctgclient.jars built at the following fix pack levels, with the "Permissions" attribute set and are signed with the trusted CA certificates: 

 * CICS TG for Multiplatforms 8.0.0.4 
 * CICS TG for Multiplatforms 8.1.0.2
   


As the updated ctgclient.jar is released in CICS TG for Multiplatforms fix packs, the equivalent level will be removed from this SupportPac. 

Possible uses 
This package can be used to allow Applets or Web Start applications using the CICS TG Applet Runtime APIs to run in the latest Java 7 environments. 

Skill level required 
It is recommended that a System Administrator install and configure this SupportPac. 

New in this release (V1.1) 
Support for CICS TG for Multiplatforms V7.2 is removed. This is due to the CICS TG for Multiplatforms V7.2 signed ctgclient,.jar now being available in CICS TG for Multiplatforms V7.2.0 fix pack 5.
