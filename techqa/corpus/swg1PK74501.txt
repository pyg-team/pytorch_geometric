APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a conditional request is made for resources and WCM is
   returning a 304 indicating that no change had occurred to the
   requested resource then we should also be sending back the
   "Expires" header to prevent the browser making the same request
   again when the page next reloads.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  E.g. If a spacer gif is used on all pages of a website then each
   page load will request this image. Having the
   resourceserver.browserCacheMaxAge set prevents browsers for
   re-requesting an image for the set amount of time. Once this
   time has been exceeded the browser will make a request to the
   server each time the image is encountered to check if it has
   changed. By sending back a new "Expires" value the browser will
   stop sending requests to the server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a conditional request is made for resources and WCM is
   returning a 304 indicating that no change had occurred to the
   requested resource then we should also be sending back the
   "Expires" header to prevent the browser making the same request
   again when the page next reloads.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  E.g. If a spacer gif is used on all pages of a website then each
   page load will request this image. Having the
   resourceserver.browserCacheMaxAge set prevents browsers for
   re-requesting an image for the set amount of time. Once this
   time has been exceeded the browser will make a request to the
   server each time the image is encountered to check if it has
   changed. By sending back a new "Expires" value the browser will
   stop sending requests to the server.
