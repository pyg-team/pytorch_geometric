IZE0106E Connect failed Missing CMAS Record 5655Y0400 R680 680 R800 800 HCI6800 5655-Y04 5655Y04 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to connect the CICS Explorer V5.1.1.0 for the first time to a Web User Interface (WUI) Server using a CMCI connection type and get the error: IZE0106E Connect failed with error "Missing CMAS Record" 

SYMPTOM
IZE0106E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/ratdevz/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.cics.zos.help/topics/reference/ize0106e.html] Connect failed with error "Missing CMAS Record"


CAUSE
An incorrect Host Name is being used that does not resolve to a correct IP Address.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Reviewing the trace shows that a 403 Forbidden is being returned:

SMCPSMConnection.get() [403, Forbidden, text/html; charset=utf-8]
SMCPSMConnection.get() [SMResponse[CMAS, 0, 15e10ab]]
SMCPSMConnection.fetch() [SMResponse[CMAS, 0, 15e10ab], CMAS, CICSCICSManagingAddressSpace]
SMCPSMConnection.fetch() [SMResponse[CMAS, 0, 15e10ab]]
SMCPSMConnection.discard() [SMResponse[CMAS, 0, 15e10ab]]
SMCPSMConnection.discard() [0]
SMConnection.connect() [com.ibm.cics.sm.comm.SystemManagerConnectionException: Missing CMAS Record ]

However, when you look at the WUI logs, there is no indication of a security failure. Looking at the response data that came back, because it contains no CMAS records, it appears that the request is not even reaching the WUI server.

This is due to an incorrect host name being specified on the CMCI connection.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the correct host name is being used for the CMCI connection and that it resolves to a valid IP address.
