ABSTRACT
 The IBM License Metric Tool Support team addressed two of the most common misunderstandings about ILMT, typically represented by the following questions:
Why is ILMT telling me I have Product A installed when I don't?
Why is ILMT assigning too many cores and PVU to my VMs?
From this presentation customers can gain a better understanding of what ILMT does, how the data is being presented, and what the customer's role is in using ILMT. 

CONTENT
Les Popow, ILMT specialist in Level 2 Support, spoke about Automated Bundling and how the products presented by ILMT are not to be taken at face value. He also described customer responsibilities, and 


explained the reading of the ILMT Sub-capacity report. 

After the presentation, Les answered questions from the audience.
