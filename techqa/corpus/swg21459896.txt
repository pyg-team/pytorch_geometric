Title: IBM Korean character issue when using ORACLE US7ASCII character set - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When retrieving data from an Oracle database with US7ASCII character set, the Korean characters are malformed.
There is no such problem retrieving Korean characters through Oracle SQL*plus. 

SYMPTOM
There are two problems when using the US7ASCII code set. 

1. All Korean characters are malformed when using the Native client driver. 

2. Supplying Korean data to a filter will not apply filtering when using the Oracle ODBC driver.


CAUSE
This is a character set issue. The code set, US7ASCII is not a unicode character set. It is an ASCII code set.


ENVIRONMENT
Datasource for the report is an Oracle Database via Native client or Oracle ODBC driver 

Oracle Database 10G / 11G; Oracle Exadata


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The code set US7ASCII is not a supported character set for Korean. Korean is a Multi-byte language, so must use a Unicode set. 


Oracle SQL*plus and a unicode application such as Cognos do not work the same way. The information in the Database is not actually correct Korean data but rather 7 bit ASCII data that if read out as 7 bit ASCII has the same byte codes as the original Korean.

If you are able to use an ODBC driver, then there is a workaround.
When using the DataDirect ODBC driver instead of the Oracle ODBC driver, there is no issue.

We suggest that you use the Korean character set recommended by each DB vendor.
