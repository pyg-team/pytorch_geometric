APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Datapower error incorrectly issued for having
   only one element allowed under the detail element.
   
   wsgw (PVR-WSP-InvoiceService): Execution of
   'http://abc-efg-xyz.eib.:10001/20110310/InvoiceSer
   vice.wsdl'
   aborted: http://x.x.x.x:10080/2011-03-10/InvoiceService: [http://x.x.x.x:10080/2011-03-10/InvoiceService:]
   cvc-complex-type
   2.4: in element detail of type
   {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}detail, found
   <ns2:exceptionName>
   (in namespace http://xml.apache.org/axis/), but next item should
   be end-element
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Navigate as follows and set to ?Skip? to skip validation of
   all faults wherever that XML Manager is used:
   XML Manager -> Compile Options Policy -> WSDL Compiler Options
   -> Validate Message Fault details -> and set to "Skip"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the validation of a fault message against a WSDL.
   
   
   DataPower enforced exactly one child element of detail element,
   and that child needed to have an associated wsdl:fault entry.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WSDL compiler has been fixed and now any number of detail
   child elements are allowed (R1002) and also children without
   an associated wsdl:fault entry in the WSDL (R2742) are allowed
   as stated in WS-I Basic Profile.
   
   Fix is available in 3.8.1.19, 3.8.2.10, 4.0.1.7 and 4.0.2.3
