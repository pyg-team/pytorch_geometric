Title: IBM Security Bulletin: January 2015 OpenSSL security vulnerabilities in Multiple IBM N Series Products - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. OpenSSL is used by Multiple IBM N Series Products. Below IBM N Series Products have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
OpenSSL is used in IBM N series Products for providing communication security by encrypting data being transmitted. 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3569 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3569] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols by the ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an unexpected handshake to trigger a NULL pointer dereference and cause the daemon to crash. 

CVSS Base Score: 5 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99706 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99706] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570] 

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.6 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault. 

CVSS Base Score: 5 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system. 

CVSS Base Score: 1.2 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions. 

CVSS Base Score: 1.2 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources 

CVSS Base Score: 5 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204] 

DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707] for the current score
