PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), the Tivoli Storage Manager is grayed out in the Navigator panel. 

SYMPTOM
Tivoli Storage Manager is grayed out and cannot get data in workspaces in Tivoli Enterprise Portal.


CAUSE
No monitoring agents are installed or recognized by ITM on the Reporting and Monitoring system.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, the following instructions should be performed on the system where the Monitoring Agent is installed.


Open the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services window. 

 * If the Monitoring Agent does not exist for the Tivoli Storage Manager server, double click on the Template for the Monitoring Agent for Tivoli Storage Manager and create a monitoring agent. 
 * If the monitoring agent already exists, do the following:  1. Right click the agent and go to Advanced->Remove Instance 
    2. Double click on the Template for the Monitoring Agent for Tivoli Storage Manager and create a monitoring agent
   
   

Note: The above instructions would be used regardless of whether the Monitoring Agent is installed on the same or a different system than the ITM/Reporting and Monitoring.  

Also note that when configuring the instance, be sure the hostname/IP address is pointing to the system that has ITM/Reporting and Monitoring installed.
