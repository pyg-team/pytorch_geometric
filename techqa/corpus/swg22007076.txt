QUESTION
 How many sourcing rules can be configured in IBM Sterling Order Management? 

CAUSE
You do not want any impact on the performance during sourcing and scheduling.

ANSWER
Number of sourcing rules may not have direct relation to performance. However, number of ShipNodes a sourcing rule may fetch to scan for inventory will influence performance.
There can been instances wherein sourcing rules can lead to system scanning about 2500 Nodes and also few instance where in the sourcing rules scan just one ShipNode.

So it is not a pragmatic approach to determine the performance of a system by the measure of Sourcing Rules. Sourcing performance is a function of ShipNode Configuration, Inventory Distribution, Number of
ShipNodes etc.
It is recommended to take this solution to production only after performance testing. 

To conclude, there is no limit to number of sourcing rules or the combination of configuration one can use as long as the system has undergone the performance and functionally test. We cannot predict
system performance without performance testing the solution.
