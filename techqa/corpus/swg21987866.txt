QUESTION
 How do I periodically purge items from a recover bin after they have been there for a certain amount of time. 

CAUSE
I need to purge items from recovery bins that are in the bins longer then 3 months.

ANSWER
1. Log into IBM FileNet Application Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE).
2. Go to your object store => Sweep Management => Sweep Policies => Disposal Policies.
3. Create a new disposal policy with the following criteria.
- Sweep mode = normal
- Target class = Recovery Item
Go to Data Design => Other Classes => Recover Item, right click and 'Copy object reference'.
- Filter expression = Now() > DateCreated + TimeSpan(90, 'days')
TimeSpan can use the following units: seconds, minutes, hours & days.
- Effective start date and Effective end date
Type in the fields something like 'July 1 2016' and hit the tab key. It will put in the value as something like 'July 1, 2016 at 12:00:00 AM Pacific Standard Time'

4. Complete your disposal sweep creation. 

 

Note: If you do not want to have the sweep running continuously, in ACCE go to object store => Sweep Management => Policy-Controlled Sweeps and edit the 'Recovery Item' sweep to set a schedule.
