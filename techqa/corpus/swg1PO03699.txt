APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At the moment StubFactory is using a pool of HTTP connections
   to make outbound web service calls. These connections can be
   closed on the server side so by the time a connection is used
   it might be stale. If that's the case the web service
   invocation fails.
   Repeating the invocation is not an option as it might not be
   clear from the exception whether the original request was
   processed by the server or not.

   web service calls. The connection might be closed after it is
   retrieved from the pool causing an error when the application
   makes a call. The Infrastructure has been configured to check
   if the connection is available before making web service calls.
