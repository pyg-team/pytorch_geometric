PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of WebSphere Application server       *
   *                  8.5.5 who attempt to install WebSphere      *

   *                      required even if Java 8 is installed    *
   *                      with WAS                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   WAS 8.5.5 can optionally install Java 8 as its runtime using a
   user property in the response file which is not identified by
   WXS causing the installation to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix in the installation code was done to determine the
   installed java level based on the user property and an iterim
   fix is made available for this
