Title: IBM Compatibility between Windows BigFix V9.5 agents and BigFix V9.2 servers/relays - United States

Text:
Windows 10 upgrading compatibility agents servers TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the process to migrate to BigFix V9.5, some compatibility issues might appear when agents are an upper version than servers and relays. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
No compatibility issues exist, on a general basis, if Windows agents are V9.5.7.94 or higher, and servers and relays are at least V9.2.12. However, many new features and functions work only in a complete (agents, relays and servers) V9.5 infrastructure. 

For example, regarding Unicode, agents have their server's limitations. If a V9.5 agent is communicating its reports to a V9.2 server, they are transmitted in the server Report Encoding, usually the FXF encoding (1252 for example). The agent cannot report everything that a V9.5 server might instead receive.
