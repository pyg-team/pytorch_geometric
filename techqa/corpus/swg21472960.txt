PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Deployment Engine (DE) uses port # 4130 during install/upgrade of Webtop/WebGUI. If this port is blocked then upgrade may fail with below errors.
TIPIN0024E Invalid User ID or password. Try again. 

SYMPTOM
The installation log may show below error messages:


ADMU0509I: The Application Server "server1" cannot be reached. It appears to be stopped.(from 
SEVERE : TIPIN0024E Invalid User ID or password. Try again. (from com.ibm.tivoli.tip.install.common.ia.WASCredentialValidationActionFP.install)
FINER : RETURN com.zerog.ia.api.pub.InstallerProxy@4f6a4f6a (from com.ibm.tivoli.tip.install.common.ia.WASCredentialValidationActionFP.install)
STDERR : SHUTDOWN REQUESTED


CAUSE
Linux provides iptables service for firewall solutions. It can potentially block a port which is used by the deployment engine and result in installation/upgrade failure.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the installation logs and see if above errors are present in the log or the upgrade is not proceeding without any obvious reasons. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check if iptables service is running. Stop this service and retry the upgrade.
