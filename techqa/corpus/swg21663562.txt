However, logging in with: https//localhost:9083/ibm/console/logon.jsp displays the correct GUI and you can create and delete users successfully.
SKLM otherwise is working fine as far as all the services, ports, CLI, DB2 connection, etc.... 

The solution is to modify "Browser mode" and "Document mode" to "Internet Explorer 9 Standards - IE9" and it should show the proper UI as follows:

1. Launch IE 9

2. Give below URL in browser address bar to launch SKLM 2.5 login page by typing 
(https//ip-address:9080/ibm/SKLM/login.jsp).

3. Login using correct SKLM credential for example SKLMAdmin and password.

4. If blank screen or distorted screen is shown then proceed with step-5 else you have good browser settings and you don't need to follow this document further

5. Keep focus on browser window and Press F12 or click on developer tools link as shown in below screen shot

6. Developer tools will be opened on the bottom of the browser as shown in below
screen shot.

7. By Default Document mode setting is set to Quirks. Change it to “Internet Explorer 9
Standards” by clicking on it and select: “Internet Explorer 9 Standards” from the drop down menu.

8. Page will refresh and GUI should be shown properly

Attached is the step-by-step document on how to do this setting with screen shots.
