ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Queries on ADMSINTABINFO are slow even if all TCBs are loaded in
   memory already.
   
   I set DBHEAP to 40000, should be able to store 20000 tables' TCB
   info, actually about 10000 tables in that db.
   Check with "db2pd -db testdb -tcb" to make sure all tables TCB
   was in DBHEAP.
   
   time db2 "select tabname from sysibmadm.admintabinfo where
   reorg_pending='Y'"
