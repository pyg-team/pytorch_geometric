ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ClearQuest 2003.06.15.734.000
   SQL Server 2000
   Client OS: MS Windows 2000, XP SP1
   Hooks written in Perl
   The control-buttons Apply and Revert are activated in the form
   (which they shouldn't do), when the tab Log is in the front.
   This tab
   contains the field Note_Entry, which was modified during the
   action FollowUp. After pushing the button Apply the following
   error-message pops
   up:
   ---------------------------
   Rational ClearQuest
   ---------------------------
   ERROR! This operation is permitted only when the entity is in an
   editable state (that is, when an AdActionDef of the appropriate
   type is being applied).
   ---------------------------
   OK
   ---------------------------
   and after pushing the button Revert the complete record window
   will be closed by ClearQuest.
   Steps to reproduce issue:
   - Reproduce databases and follow the steps outlined above
   - Log in to ClearQuest Designer and check out the IPIS_WM schema
   - Set the Test database to be IPTS2
   - Test Work
   - Run the All Defects query
   - On IPTS200000155, select the Log Tab
   - Go to Actions -> FollowUp
   - The following dialog appears which is:
   ---------------------------
   IPIS Info
   ---------------------------
   Added followup Defect IPTS200000396 to parent Defect
   IPTS200000155.
   ---------------------------
   OK
   ---------------------------
   - This is expected behaviour, but the Apply and Revert buttons
   are active. They are supposed to be greyed out.
   - When you click on Apply, you get this error:
   ---------------------------
   Rational ClearQuest
   ---------------------------
   ERROR! This operation is permitted only when the entity is in an
   editable state (that is, when an AdActionDef of the appropriate
   type is being applied).
   ---------------------------
   OK
   ---------------------------
   - When you click on Revert, the record closes completely
   Observations:
   - If the Log Tab isn't selected, it behaves as desired
   - If you move to the next record even though the Apply and
   Revert buttons are enabled, and then move back to IPTS200000155,
   the Apply and Revert button will be disabled.
   - Removing the "New Progress Note" from the form makes this
   issue go away, but this is not acceptable for the customer as
   this field is mandatory for other actions.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After execution of a record_script alias action hook the
   fields
   of a record become editable, once modified an attempt
   to commit
   to the database generates an error that the record
   is not in edi
   table state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 2003.06.16-2007A and 7.0.0.1-IFIX01.
