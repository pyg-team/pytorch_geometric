APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Since there were no official Statistics 20FP1 Adapters for C&DS
   5.0, we have proceeded to install the Statistics Adapter 20FP1
   for C&DS 4.2.1 and to change the install folder to C&DS 5.0.
   
   When executing a simple Stats syntax job, C&DS reports sporadic
   failed executions. There are times when job is successfully run,
   however, there were more reports where it is failed.
   
   The cds.log file produces the following message:
   21:50:42,736 ERROR [SPSSBPkgClient] RemoteStatisticSyntaxCommand
   failed with ErrorCode:1, ConnectionId:25
   
   Customer expects to the job to be successfully run all the time
   with no errors.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This has been reported to the IBM SPSS Statistics development
   team for investigation.
   
   The issue seems to lie with the password used for the
   repository. When jobs are submitted, we prepare the REPOSITORY
   CONNECT syntax with an encrypted password. This encrypted
   password generated for each job submission based on the
   repository password. Some times this encrypted password contains
   '+' symbol. Statistics syntax treats '+' for joining two syntax
   lines and when this job finds this invalid symbol probably job
   fails. This job only fails sporadically because we do the
   encrypt every time when we submit the job and only few times
   this symbol is used.
   
   Work around could be disable the repository settings in the job
   step and then prepend the REPOSITORY CONNECT within the syntax.
