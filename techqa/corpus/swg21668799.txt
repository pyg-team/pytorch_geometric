 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL Security Advisory updates Feb 2013: GSKit Lucky 13 TLS CBC Timing Attack - CVE-2013-0169. 
A vulnerability in relation to Session ID Lengths and SSL/TLS Server has been discovered that impacts GSKit - CVE-2012-2190.
OpenSSL before 0.9.8y, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0k, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1d does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP responses, which allows remote OCSP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an invalid key - CVE-2013-0166 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
GSKit advisories: (CVE-2013-0169), (CVE-2012-2190) and (CVE-2013-0166)
VULNERABILITY DETAILS: 

CVEID: CVE-2012-2190 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2190]
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75994 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75994] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 
DESCRIPTION: IBM Global Security Kit (aka GSKit), as used in IBM HTTP Server in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1.x before 6.1.0.45, 7.0.x before 7.0.0.25, 8.0.x before 8.0.0.4, and 8.5.x before 8.5.0.1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted ClientHello message in the TLS Handshake Protocol. 


CVE ID: CVE-2013-0166 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0166]
CVSS:Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/81904 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/81904] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Description: OpenSSL before 0.9.8y, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0k, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1d does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP responses, which allows remote OCSP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an invalid key. 

CVEID: CVE-2013-0169 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0169] 
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/81902 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/81902]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
Description: The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.
