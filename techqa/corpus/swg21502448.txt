Title: IBM How is the license validity for Rational DOORS licenses determined - United States

QUESTION
 Is there a matrix available to identify license validity for IBM Rational DOORS? 

ANSWER
The license key validity for Rational DOORS is basically aligned with the maintenance end date reflected from the respective license key. 

 
For example, if current license has a maintenance end date as follows reflected from the FEATURE/INCREMENT line:


FEATURE DOORS telelogic 2008.1231 permanent 1


 

This means that the key will work only for the DOORS releases available till '2008.1231' as reflected on the key. Hence if there is a later version of DOORS to be used , then this date should be greater than the release date of the respective version. This is accomplished when a new RENEWAL is purchased and the order will be reflected from the license key center. 

There will be two orders listed from LKC as follows: 


IBM RATIONAL DOORS FLOATING LIC 

IBM RATIONAL DOORS FLOATING S&S RENEWAL




 

The above orders depict the 'LIC' (actual license order, which has older maintenance date and used to generate a key by providing the host details), and 'S&S RENEWAL' order keys (for the latest renewal date). Go into 'LIC order first to generate the keys with the expired maintenance order and later go into 'S&S RENEWAL' order to update the maintenance on the already generated keys. 

So the above license feature can look like as follows, after upgrade:


FEATURE DOORS telelogic 2009.1231 permanent 1
