APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to connect WebSphere MQ Explorer to a remote
   queue manager via a SSL configuration using a channel
   definition table (AMQCLCHL.TAB) file; MQ Explorer fails to
   connect. An error dialog is displayed showing:
   
     Queue manager QMGRNAME is not available for client
        connection due to an SSL configuration error. (AMQ4199)
     Severity: 30 (Severe Error)
     Explanation: The user is trying to connect to a remote queue
        manager using a secure connection.
     Response: Check the SSL configuration of the target queue
   manager and the local SSL trust store.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure MQ Explorer v8.0 to use a direct connection instead
   of using the AMQCLCHL.TAB method. This problem only occurs with
   MQ Explorer v8.0, v8.0.0.1; previous versions of MQ Explorer do
   not have this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of MQ Explorer v8.0.0.0 who are
   attempting to connect to a remote queue manager using an
   SSL-secured connection defined in a client channel definition
   table (CCDT).
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64, Linux on x86, Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A coding error in MQ Explorer's CCDT parsing logic meant that a
   NullPointerException occurred when attempting to parse the SSL
   configuration details from the CCDT. This prevented MQ Explorer
   from attempting to connect to the queue manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ Explorer has been updated so that the
   NullPointerException does not occur when parsing the SSL
   configuration information from the CCDT.
