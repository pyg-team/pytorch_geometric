ABSTRACT
 IBMÂ® Content Manager OnDemand for i, product number 5770-RD1, is not sent on the stacked media (CDs) that you receive with operating system upgrades but rather must be downloaded from the Passport Advantage web site. You must be Passport Advantage-entitled (with your software subscription) to the 5770-RD1 product before you can download it. 

CONTENT
You should verify with your IBM marketing representative or IBM business partner that you are Passport Advantage-entitled. If you are, you can go to the Passport Advantage Web site and download the Content Manager OnDemand for i software. 

To download the software: 

1. Go to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage] and click the tab labeled Passport Advantage Online. That will bring you to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm], where you can click Customer sign-in.

2. Enter your registration ID or site number. If you do not know what this is or you do not have a registration ID, contact the Passport Advantage group at 1-800-978-2246. Their hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern time (EDT (summer) or EST (winter)), excluding U.S. legal holidays. For customers outside the U.S. or Canada, see https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html [https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html] . If, on the other hand, you need your password reset or are having issues logging on to Passport Advantage Online, dial 888-426-4409.

3. Click on Software download & media access, then Continue to proceed to the "Download Software" tab. All entitled downloads should be listed. Select IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i. On the next panel, select "All operating systems" (not "IBM i" as you might think) and specify your language, then GO, Confirm that the Version says 7.2.0 and that there is a checkmark next to "Required: 23 files". Click on the plus sign next to "Select individual files" and look for IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i V7.2 Multilingual eAssembly (CRRA6ML). Expand the Twistie and place a checkmark next to IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i V7.2 Multilingual (CIYA2ML). This contains the base Server code (*BASE of 5770-RD1), known as Common Server, and also contains OnDemand Web Enablement Kit (ODWEK). Then click on the Download button. On the screen that follows, you will select a Download location and Download method. Once you agree to the license agreement's terms and conditions, the files will begin downloading. 

4. The CIYA2ML option will download a CMOD_for_i_7.2.zip file, which, depending on the download method selected, might get placed in the C:\DownloadDirector directory. The zip file extracts into two files. These are a) the RD1 code in a file named BASE and b) a CIYA2ML.pdf file that has the instructions for uploading this code to the IBM i server and loading the Licensed Program Product, 5770-RD1. This PDF instruction file is also provided below.

5. Follow the instructions inside the CIYA2ML document to upload and install the product on the IBM i.

Note: You might see a choice for "Optional files" listed on step 3, underneath the "Required files" checkbox. This box should be checked if you are interested in downloading IBM Content Navigator or WebSphere Application Server supplements
