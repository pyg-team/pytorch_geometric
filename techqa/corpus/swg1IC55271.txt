APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After migration to v6.1 the Broker fails to start with the error
   BIP8284E: Failed to find NT security domain, <domain name>.  In
   v6, the Broker verification of the domain information did not
   happen at startup as it now does with v6.1.  If the domain
   information has been stored in lower case, the failure occurs.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Check the registry for the domain name and confirm the name case
   is updated correctly.  Modify the name to upper case and restart
   the system for the change to take effect and the Broker should
   now start.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker V6.1   *
   *                 on Windows.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Broker checks for logon credentials *
   *                      during startup. If the logon domain     *
   *                      name is not in upper case the Broker    *
   *                      will fail to start.                     *
   *                      The following error will be displayed:  *
   *                                                              *
   *                      BIP8284E: Failed to find NT security    *
   *                      domain                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   On the Windows platform, WebSphere Message Broker V6.1
   fails to start if the logon domain name is not in upper case.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed such that a case insensitive
   comparison of domain name is performed.
