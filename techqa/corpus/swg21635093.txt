Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting data for automation scripting problems with Maximo. Gathering this information before calling IBM support will help you with the troubleshooting process and save time analyzing the data. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Maximo Automation Scripting specific Collecting Data information 
This technote describes what information you need to begin troubleshooting a Maximo automation scripting issue. 

*It is important to note that Scripts are considered custom code. Support does not engage in writing scripts or debugging of custom scripts. PMR's submitted that do not reflect a problem with the Application or MBO code provided by IBM may be closed as unsupported.

If you have not compiled the General information, Please see General Collecting Data document 1313647 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21313647] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21393187]and include that information. 

As we build a library of documented examples for how scripting can be used, Support may request you provide the following information for your PMR. Please review the following information that may provide answers to your scripting questions:

1. Customizing with Automation Scripts:

2. Use Service Management Connect site to interact with developers. This is the most effective way to talk directly with developers to get sample code and questions answered regarding your custom code. 

Here are some scripting examples:
