ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   Client OS and level: XPsP2
   
   Server OS and level: Win2003sp2
   
   Database and level: Oracle 10.1.0.4
   
   Scenario:
   
   1. Open SmDemo R19 on Sp5 base
   
   2. Create a new item
   
   3. Lifecycle --> new revision: COM error
   
   
   
   Unable to cast COM object of type 'SmarTeam.Std.Interop.SmarTeam
   .SmRecList.Sm
   RecordClass' to interface type 'SmarTeam.Std.Interop.SmarTeam.Sm
   RecList.ISm  RawRecordList'.
   This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM
    component for the nterface with IID '{C85E7015-8B4F-11D1-8E20-0
   0A02498EA3C}' failed due to the following error: No such interfa
   ce supported (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE)
   ).
   
   mail from Blaise Metzker:
   
   For your information about the file upload:
   
   I added a movie with the scenario. Open the htm to view the movi
   e or
   drag and drop the swf on to Internet Explorer.
   
   
   
   Further I would like to remark, that the error is only within We
   bEditor.
   In Editor the new revision function works correctly.
   
   
   Database search Yes
   
   Search Arguments: SMARTEAM_UNABLE_TO_CAST_COM_OBJECT
   
   Search result: 06521,660,706 and 06596,660,706 are similar but n
   ot
   identical - caused by customisation.
   
   
   
   Reproduction of problem scenario: No
   
   
   
   if not reproduced, why? : Tested on V5R19SP04 but worked ok. Do
   not have
   SP5 environment set up yet.
