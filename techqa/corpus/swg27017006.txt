Application deployment for WebSphere Application Server extended to cell scope 
The was_common_deploy_install_apps action can now be run at the cell scope; previously this action was available at the cluster and server scopes only. 

Executing this action at the cell scope allows you to deploy an action to the clusters and servers that you specify. At the server and cluster scope, this action deploys an application to a server or to all of the servers in a cluster.

In 7.1.1.2, the following new actions for application deployment were added at the node scope:  * was_common_deploy_copy_application_files 
 * was_common_deploy_delete_application_files


If your application requires additional files, such as property files or shared jars, these actions can be used to manage these when you deploy the application. 





Support for installing the latest fix packs to WebSphere Application Server target systems 
The following actions for installing individual fix packs for WebSphere Application Server 7.0 were added: 
If media for these fix packs is available in the media tree, the was_70_install_with_all_patches action installs them. 





Support for installing the latest fix packs to WebSphere Portal target systems 
The following actions for installing individual fix packs for WebSphere Portal 6.1 were added: 
If media for these fix packs is available in the media tree, the wp_61_install_with_all_patches action installs them. 





Fixes and enhancements for version 7.1.1.2 
This version of Rational Automation Framework for WebSphere contains enhancements and fixes to problems in the following areas: 

WebSphere resource providers Improved error handling, results, and comparisons for the default J2EE resources provided by WebSphere Application Server.

Transfer between framework server and target systems Improved speed, consistency, and handling of dropped connections in the logic that transfers media and product code from the framework server to target systems. 

Batch and shell scripts Improved recognition of different operating system and platform architecture combinations. 

Removed case sensitivity from host name comparisons used to determine local versus remote execution.

Enterprise application deployment for WebSphere Application Server  Improved error handling and allowed for the declaration of individual OPTION properties to be declared rather than as a single OPTIONS string.

Environment Generation Wizard GUI Improved handling of RAFW_HOME and password fields that contain special characters.

Allows configuration of a WebSphere Application Sever Network Deployment cell that does not contain clusters.
