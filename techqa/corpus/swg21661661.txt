PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Client has redirected sysout using the WAS redirect_server_output_dir 
command which then permits the usage of the ROLL_LOGS command so that 
they can roll the SYSOUT output (send to a USS file) daily. Documentation regarding the ROLL_LOGS command can be found at the following doc-link: 
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.installation.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/cins_outdest.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.installation.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/cins_outdest.html]


SYMPTOM
Joblog shows: TEMAGCCollector.gclog.path = JESLOG:SYSOUT:DISCARD


CAUSE
ITCAM on z/OS does not check for redirect_server_output. ITCAM z/OS uses the JES capture facility so to use the SYSOUT JES log for the GC data, because that is unique to each servant. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Add the WAS JVM parm Xverbosegclog - ITCAM expects to find the GC data in the sysout of the Xverbosegclog:${SERVER_LOG_ROOT}/<gclogpath> 

 2. The GC log file path specified in the Xverbosegclog JVM parm must be added to the kwjdc.properties parm "TEMAGCCollector.gclog.path=."
