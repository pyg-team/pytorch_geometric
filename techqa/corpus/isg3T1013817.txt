PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I configure host name information? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Hosts that have more than one network interface usually have one Internet address for each interface. Such hosts are called multi-homed hosts.

LSF identifies hosts by name, so it needs to match each of these addresses with a single host name. To do this, the host name information must be configured so that all of the Internet addresses for a host resolve to the same name.There are two ways to do this:

 * Modify the system hosts file (/etc/hosts) and the changes will affect the whole system 

* Create an LSF hosts file ($LSF_CONFDIR/hosts) and LSF will be the only application that resolves the addresses to the same host.

Please refer to page:115 and section: Hosts with Multiple Addresses for details
