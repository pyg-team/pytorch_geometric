ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Initially, a user had issues with the timestamps of emails
   because of a defective laptop battery causing the OS time to be
   incorrect. During their tests, they found that the local OS
   time can be changed via Notes client. This is by using the
   option "Prompt for time/date/phone" in the Basics tab of the
   Location Document. If you set this to YES, once you change to
   this location, you will be prompted by a panel wherein you can
   manually set phone dialing prefix as well as the date and time
   for that location.
   
   You can manually set ANY date, regardless of the year. The
   local OS time will change to the manually set date in the panel.
   If you send an email after manually setting a date, notice that
   the fields in the Document Properties pulls the erroneous time
   from the OS, specifically the Created field on the first tab.
   
   If the date is set in the PAST, the fields Created (Initially),
   Modified (Initially), Added (In this file) and Modified (In
   this file) would be in the present/correct date. After sending
   a few emails, you will notice that the Created (Initially)
   field would sometimes change to the date set in the panel. (The
   other fields would most likely remain at the present/correct
   date.) But this is NOT constant. There are instances wherein
   the Created (Initially) field would display a date that you
   NEVER used in your tests at all, which makes the results
   inconsistent. At times, the Created field is correct, at
   another time, it would remain to the previous date you set
   (will not update to the new date you set in the panel), and
   then, it would display a date you never used at all, which
   makes us wonder where this date is being pulled.
   
   If the date is set in the future, all this fields would be in
   that future date. But at times, would not update to the new
   date set in the prompt and would remain at the previous set
   date.
