Title: IBM Profile Management Tool incorrectly indicates that you can create a cell profile in a feature-pack installation - United States

Text:
ModBatchRnotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you use the Profile Management Tool to create a profile in a Feature Pack for Modern Batch Version 1.0 installation with IBM WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express, the cell profile is incorrectly displayed as an option. However, this profile template does not exist in a WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express installation and is not supported. If you select the cell profile in this situation, profile creation fails.

If you uninstall the feature pack from an installation of WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express, an error message that refers to the BATCH/cell/default profile template is written to the uninstallation log. 

SYMPTOM
If you attempt to create a cell profile with WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express, profile creation fails. 

When you uninstall the feature pack, an error message that is in the following format is written to the uninstallation log:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you attempt to use the Profile Management Tool to create a cell profile in a feature-pack installation with WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express and profile creation fails, retry the creation process and select a profile that is supported. 

If you uninstall the feature pack from an installation of WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Application Server - Express, ignore the error message in the uninstallation log file that references the BATCH/cell/default profile template.
