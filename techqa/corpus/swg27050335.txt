Text:
v2240rlsnotes RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 In rare cases, a permissions issue could cause the ITCAM WebSphere Application Server agent uninstall to fail. 

CONTENT
Problem: In cases where the ITCAM monitoring agent uninstall is not successful, the WebSphere Application Servers that were being monitored will no longer start. This happens when ITCAM for WAS configuration parameters defined in each application server do not get removed when the unconfiguration portion of the uninstall fails.




Resolution: There are two possible solutions for this issue.
1. Deploy the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server again. Once the shared service is deployed, attempt the uninstall again.
2. Manually remove the WebSphere Application Server configuration that is specific to ITCAM and is causing this issue. For information about manual removal, refer to the ITCAM topic the Related Information below.
