QUESTION
 Why am I receiving "Timer heap overflow" messages from my application. 

ANSWER


You should use the CPP_CG::Framework::TimerMaxTimeouts property to do this. You can find this field within the Project Properties and increase the value that may be in the field currently. You can find out more about this within the online help under List of Books>Properties Reference Guide .
