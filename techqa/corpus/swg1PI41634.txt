APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM adds its SOAP headers (ITCAMTOOLKITSyncSoapHeader,
   ITCAMCorrelator, KD4SoapHeaderV2) only when there is a child
   element for Header under the SOAP envelope for JAXWS
   implementation of Axis2 that is used by WebSphere.  If the
   header element is not added or
   stripped out by other handlers in the chain, then the elements
   are not added.  This prevents the linking between multiple
   systems through which the request flows (WAS->WAS, WAS->DP,
   etc.) in SOA, Transaction Tracking or even in the Managing
   server GPS functionality.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   
   Web services monitored by ITCAM to link the provider and the
   client using ITCAM Managing server, ITCAM for Transaction
   Tracking, or ITCAM for SOA.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   ITCAM relies on the presence of SOAP header to add its
   correlators so that the destination of the web service request
   or response can take proper action.  In certain applications, it
   has been observed that the SOAP headers are not created.  The
   SOAP header will need to be created if this condition is
   detected so that ITCAM components can add their correlators to
   the SOAP header.
