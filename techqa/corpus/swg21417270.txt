QUESTION
 How can robotic scripts be moved from a development environment to a production environment? 

CAUSE
Initially scripts are exported to the Application Management Console, T3, directly from the source that creates them, such as Rational Performance Tester (RPT.) Administrators need to have a mechanism to get scripts from one environment to another without having to go back to the source.

ANSWER
In order to move scripts from one ITCAM environment to the AMC in a production environment, use these steps to copy the appropriate files. This process discusses where to find the files, which files to copy, and where to place the files in the production environment. 

 1. It is best to upgrade the source and target T3 agents to the same version before proceeding. 
 2. Where to find the RPT scripts and runtime 
    
    a) RPT scripts (and runtime zips) that run on RRT (Robotic Response Time, T6) agents are exported to the AMC first and then copied to the RRT agent when a profile is activated to run the script. After a script is added and run by a profile, the script is updated on the RRT agent when the AMC copy is updated.
    
    The script is found in <ITM>\kt1depot\T6\RPT\<Script Name>.zip on the RRT (t6) agent and in <ITM>/kt1depot/T3/RPT on the AMC (t3) agent. 
    
    The runtime file is found in <ITM>\kt1depot\T6\RPTRUNTIMES\<Runtime Version>.zip on the RRT agent and in <ITM>/kt1depot/T3/RPTRUNTIMES on the AMC.
    
    b) The RRT agent executes the script via a profile after copying and extracting the associated files. All scripts to be executed are found in the <ITM>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\scripts\<Script Name> folder on the RRT (t6) agent. The runtime is found in <ITM>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\runtimes\<Runtime Version> folder on the RRT (t6) agent.

 3. Which files to copy and where
    
    To use a script and runtime, copy them to the production AMC:
    
    a) Find the robotic script file in the <ITM>\kt1depot\T3\RPT directory on the AMC. 
    Copy the file to the same directory on the production AMC. 
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417270&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417270&aid=2]
    
    b) If you want all the profiles and properties of the T3 agent, then copy the entire kt1depot directory including these subdirectories and contents:
    
    profiles
    applications
    schedules
    transactions
    components
    
    You can copy only profiles from the development AMC to the production AMC. This limits your ability to change schedules and profile content. 
    
    ITM_HOME/kt1depot/T3/profiles/<script-name>.xml (source) ==> ITM_HOME/kt1depot/T3/profiles/<script-name>.xml (target) 
    
    Alternatively, create a new profile and schedule the script to run through the production AMC. After the profile runs the script successfully, the files described in step 1 are found in the RRT file structure. Remove all compressed.encoded files from the kt1depot/T3 directories.These compressed.encoded files are regenerated when the T3 is restarted.
    
    c) If the runtime zip is not already found on the production AMC, copy the runtime.ZIP file from the <ITM>/kt1depot/T3/RPTRUNTIMES directory to the same directory on the production AMC. There are a limited number of runtime zip files. One runtime can be used by multiple RPT scripts.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417270&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417270&aid=3]
    
    
    
    To determine which runtime is needed, find the <ITM>\kt1depot\T3\RPT\<Script Name>.zip file on the AMC host. Open the ZIP file and examine the content of the <Script Name>.properties file. This properties file contains the runtime name. For example:
    
    runtimeLocation=RPTRUNTIMES/7.3.302.v20100825_1050_27288449.zip
    
 4. Removing scripts from the development environment 
    
    a) Stop the RRT agent. 
    b) Open the AMC Editor. Stop the profile and remove the managed systems from the script distribution. 
    c) Optionally delete <ITM>\kt1depot\T3\RPT\<Script Name>.zip on the development AMC host.
    d) Optionally delete <ITM>\kt1depot\T6\RPT\<Script Name>.zip on the development RRT host.
    e) Optionally delete the <Script Name> directory under <ITM>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\scripts on the development RRT host.
    f) From the ITM console (TEPS) AMC > Robotic Scripts workspace, right-click the script name, select the Take Action command to delete the script, and click OK. Press F5 to refresh the screen. The script name is removed from this workspace only.
    g) Restart the RRT agent.
    
    Note: After you restart the T3 agent, it may take the agent several minutes to regenerate the 'compressed.encoded' files. If you try to open the AMC editor before these files have been regenerated, the following message displays: 
    
    The T3 depot agent could not be contacted.
    
    Click OK to dismiss the message. Then, wait a few more minutes and try again.
    
 5. Verify the copy
    
    Navigate to the AMC through the ITM console and verify that the copied script appears.
