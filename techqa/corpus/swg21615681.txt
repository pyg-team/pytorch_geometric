Title: IBM FileNet P8 Workplace XT sessions timeout randomly, sooner than the configured session timeout in WebSphere - United States

Text:
WorkplaceXT; session is invalid; timeout TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Workplace XT (WPXT) sessions randomly time out and users are redirected to the logon screen sooner than the default session timeout setting 

CAUSE
Once authenticated, session information is stored in the default cookie, named JSESSIONID. Other applications may also use that cookie to store data, causing the session information to be overwritten. Consequently, WPXT generates the invalid session error message and redirects users to the logon page.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem can be corrected by simply changing the default cookie name from JSESSIONID to something else as follows:


 1. In WebSphere admin console, navigate to Applications - Application Types - WebSphere Enterprise Applications and click on WorkplaceXT 
 2. Click on Session Management under the Web Module Properties heading 
 3. Click on the "Enable cookies" link 
 4. Under Cookie Name, change to value from JSESSIONID to something else such as JSESSIONIDWPXT 
 5. Click Apply and Ok and save the changes 
 6. Restart the WorkplaceXT application
