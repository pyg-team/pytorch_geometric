APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Call Home dump file root directory was changed to the
   /data/hdd-files/systemlogs/callhome directory in PureApplication
   System version 2.1.2.0.
   
   That directory is created the first time a Call Home trap
   occurs. However, in the case that a user tries to manually
   create a problem or attempts to upload a file to an existing
   problem, before a trap occurs, an error occurs.
   
   "Upload file failed with error number 500"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Navigate to System > System Settings, expand the "Service and
      Support Manager" section and click on the edit icon.
   2. On the "Service and Support Level" tab, choose the "Do not
      collect troubleshooting information and do not open a service
      request..." option. Click OK.
      This will allow us to create the
      /data/hdd-files/systemlogs/callhome directory without opening
      a new service ticket.
   3. Navigate to System > Events, and pick an event that you would
      like to use to create a problem.
   4. Click on the Call Home phone action icon for that event.
      Click OK on any confirmation dialog that may appear.
   5. Navigate to System -> Problems and wait for your new problem
      to be created.
   
      Once it appears, wait for a file to show up in the problem
      files table.
   
      This will mean that /data/hdd-files/systemlogs/callhome has
      been created.
   
   You can now add your file to the original problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Code has been added to create the directory if it does not
   already exist.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.2.0.0.
