APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During RAA V6.0 installation, if the WAS registry keys are not
   found and the WAS location is found using a deep search of the
   filesystem, the WAS home location does not get stored,
   resulting in a NullPointerException when the install tries to
   retrieve the value and update Common.cfg.  This causes a popup
   message to appear to the user that says
   
   
   Error during "install" phase:
   
   Errors occurred while trying to update Common.cfg
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  During the RAA install, on the WAS information panel,
   change the WAS home location to something invalid (e.g. add or
   remove a character from the end of the path to make it a folder
   that doesn't exist).  Next, click the Validate Settings button,
   which will return an error message.  Then, change the path back
   to the correct WAS home location and click Validate Settings
   again.  That will trigger the install program to store the
   location and should resolve the error during the installation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In scenarios where WAS was installed by a different user than
   that which was installing RAA, the RAA installation did not
   properly record the location of WAS on the system, even when the
   installation was able to detect the WAS location automatically.
   The missing WAS location information caused an error when
   updating RAA configuration files later in the installation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The RAA installation has been fixed to properly store the WAS
   location in this scenario so the configuration files can be
   properly updated.
