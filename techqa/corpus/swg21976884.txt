Title: IBM JOBTASK's OWNERGROUP value is incorrect when importing a Job Plan with JOBTASK - United States

Text:
TPAEINTEGRATION; alias TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 JOBTASK's OWNERGROUP value is not set correctly when a Job Plan value is imported with JOBTASK using a flatfile import. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Steps to replicate: 

1. Go to the Object Structures application.

2. Create a new Object Structure. 

 Object Structure : MYJP1 

 Consumed by : INTEGRATION
Source Objects: 
- 1. JOBPLAN 
- 2. JOBTASK - Parent : JOBPLAN - Relationship : JOBTASK 
Support Flat Structure? : checked. 

 Save the record. 


Alias Conflict? becomes checked. You need to change the conflicted attributes' alias.

3. Select Action --> Add/Modify Alias 

 For example, the OWNERGROUP field exists in JOBPLAN and JOBTASK. 

 So you need to change the alias for the JOBTASK's OWNERGROUP field from OWNERGROUP to a different name such as "OWNERGROUP_T" .

Please make sure that Alias Conflict? is unchecked.

4. Go to the Enterprise Service application. 

Create a new Enterprise Service using the object structure 'MYJP1'. 



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21976884&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21976884&aid=3]


5. Go to the External System application 

 Open EXTSYS1 - Go to 'Enterprise Services' Tab 

 Add 'MYJP1' enterprise service 

 
Now import data using the data below:
EXTSYS1,MYJP1,AddChange,EN
AMCREW,ASSIGNEDOWNERGROUP,CALENDAR,CLASSSTRUCTUREID,CREWID,CREWWORKGROUP,DESCRIPTION,DOWNTIME,FLOWACTION,FLOWACTIONASSIST,FLOWCONTROLLED,FNCONOFFSET,HASNESTEDJP,INCTASKSINSCHED,INTERRUPTIBLE,JOBPLANID,JPDURATION,JPNUM,LABORCODE,LAUNCHENTRYNAME,ORGID,OWNER,OWNERGROUP,PERSONGROUP,PLUSCCHANGEBY,PLUSCCHANGEDATE,PLUSCREVCOM,PLUSCREVNUM,PLUSCSTATUSDATE,PRIORITY,REQASSTDWNTIME,SITEID,STATUS,STCONOFFSET,SUPERVISOR,SUSPENDFLOW,TASKTYPE,TEMPLATETYPE,TESTFIELD1,ASSIGNEDOWNERGROUP_T,CLASSSTRUCTUREID_T,CONDITIONNUM,DESCRIPTION_T,FLOWACTION_T,FLOWACTIONASSIST_T,FLOWCONTROLLED_T,JO1,JO2,JO3,JO4,JO5,JO6,JO7,JO8,JOBPLANID_T,JOBTASKID,JPTASK,LAUNCHENTRYNAME_T,METERNAME,NESTEDJOBPLANID,NESTEDJPNUM,OWNER_T,OWNERGROUP_TASK,PLUSCJPREVNUM,PLUSCNESTEDJPREVNUM,PLUSCREVSTATUS,PREDECESSORTASKS,SUSPENDFLOW_T,TASKDURATION,TASKSEQUENCE,TASKTYPE_T

According to the data above, 
JOBPLAN's OWNERGROUP is MAINT, 
JOBTASK 10 's OWNERGROUP is SAFETY 
and JOBTASK 20's OWNERGROUP is MAINT. 

But when importing data, you can see that all JOBTASKs' s OWNERGROUP values are set with 'MAINT' unexpectedly. 

This problem occurs because the alias forJOBTASK's OWNERGROUP (OWNERGROUP_TASK) in the data file is mismatched with the alias (OWNERGROUP_T) defined in the Object Structure. 

The problem will be fixed after matching the alias.
