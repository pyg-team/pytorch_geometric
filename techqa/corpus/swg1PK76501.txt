APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CCSID 5026(DBCS) specified in zparm of QMGR. The following
   error occurs at CHINIT startup.
   +CSQT938E M70A CSQXFCTL Unable to make subscription
    reason=536909121
    subscription name
    topic
    /StreamSupport
   .
   +CSQT866E M70A CSQXFCTL Queued Pub/Sub command message
   discarded, Reason=2195
   .
   The problem occurs because although the command message being
   processed is in 5026 (the qmgr's ccsid) the string
   "/StreamSupport" is not correct for this codepage - the hex
   values for the lowercase characters are incorrect (although they
   would be correct for the majority of EBCDIC codepages).
   .
   In both ccsid 5026 and ccsid 1390 the lowercase characters occur
   at different points in the codepage compared to most EBCDIC
   codepages.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A CSQT938E message is issued upon       *
   *                      CHINIT start up when the queue manager  *
   *                      is running in a DBCS (e.g. 1390 or      *
   *                      5026).                                  *
   *                      or                                      *
   *                      A CSQT938E message with a negative      *
   *                      reason code upon CHINIT start up.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During CHINIT start up the Queued Pub/Sub Daemon is started if
   PSMODE is set to ENABLED. If the queue manager is running in a
   DBCS (e.g. 1390 or 5026) a CSQT938E or a CSQX053E message can
   be issued and the daemon is stopped. This is due to data
   conversion problems in the daemon.
   
   Another problem can be seen during CHINIT start-up if the queue
   manager's PSMODE is set to ENABLED and it doesn't matter which
   CCSID the queue manager is running in. The error message is
   shown below: -
   
    +CSQT938E +MQPT CSQXFCTL Unable to make subscription
     reason=-1985836992
     subscription name
     topic MQ/MQPT
     /StreamSupport
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been altered to accommodate the queue manager being
   run in a DBCS, and to prevent the CSQT938E message with the
   negative reason code.
