APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user is unable to successfully enable TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2
   protocols for the HTTPSConnetor in 8.0.0.4. The property can be
   set using mqsichangeproperties eg:
   
   mqsichangeproperties <broker> -e <eg> -o HTTPSConnector
   -n sslProtocol -v TLSv1.2
   
   The property can be successfully set but inspection of a JSSE
   trace shows TLS being used instead. If the connecting client is
   unable to support TLS then the client may see the following
   exception:
   
   SSLHandshakeException: Server chose TLSv1, but that protocol
   version is not enabled or not supported by the client.
   
   At V10.0 a user is also unable to enable SSLv3 on the
   HTTPSConnector.
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): TLSV1.1, TSLv1.2,
   HTTPSConnector, SSLHandshakeException
