ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  These problems are based upon some usage scenarios from an Emily
   Wang at ITT who is using our UPDM profile, The problems she has
    encountered are not down to the UPDM profile per se but deficie
   ncies in the functionality of the table and matrix views.
   
   2/ In the matrix layout matrixlayout_2 i tried do create a matri
   x
   looking at the relationships between the activities, callbehavio
   urs and
   actions.
   
   
   
   2.1 / Action is not on the Form Element Types and To Element Typ
   es list,
   only State ( i know this maps to an action because of how our ac
   tivity
   diagrams work) See the Matrix view, Matrixview_3.
