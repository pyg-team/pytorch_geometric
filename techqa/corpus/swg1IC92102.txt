APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the HTTPRequest Node receives a response message which
   contains a status line which does not include a reason phrase
   the followingexception may be thrown:
   
   RecoverableException BIP3159S: An error was found whilst parsing
   HTTP header data. The data is not an HTTP Request or Response.
   Invalid HTTP Header data. The first few characters from the data
   were:
   
   ''HTTP/1.1 200
   
   An example of an HTTP status line which includes no reason
   phrase is the line:
   
   "HTTP/1.1 200 "
   
   It is conventional to return the reason phrase "OK" for example:
   
   "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".
   
   The HTTP specification permits a reason phrase to be the empty
   string but a space character must follow the status code however
   this APAR will modify WebSphere Message Broker to be lenient and
   permit status
   lines using any of the following example formats:
   
   "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   
   "HTTP/1.1 200 "
   
   "HTTP/1.1 200"
   
   
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): webservices httprequest
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Modify the remote server to return a non-empty Reason Phrase
