LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Authoring UI, on object list, select Filter by
   Title. There is no "Match Case" option and
   title filter is case-sensitive by default. Customer wants "Match
   Case" option that was available
   in 5.x so they can do case-insensitive filters.
   
   The following errors appear in SystemOut.log:
   None
   
   Problem Analysis:
   Customer's complaint was that they didn't have the option to do
   a case-insensitive filter (which was available in 5.x).
   
   In 6.x, jcr search is case-sensitive by default and juru search
   is case-insensitive by default.
   
   The ui for the match case checkbox on a text filter was disabled
   in 6.x because, according to the comment in the source,
   "JCR currently does not support case matching"
   
   However, this comment was incorrect, since the text filter uses
   internal JCR search, not juru search.
   
   As a result, in 6.x, text filter on view was case sensitive with
   no option for case-insensitive.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  a) create a pair of case-insensitive XPath
   expression types in XPathUtil.java.
   These expression types simply use the XPath function
   fn:lower-case() to downcase both sides of the comparison.
   The two new expression types are:
   case-insensitive "like" (EXPR_LIKE_NOCASE)
   case-insensitive "not like" (EXPR_NOT_LIKE_NOCASE).
   
   b) re-enable the ui in TableStringFilter.java and call the new
   expressions.
