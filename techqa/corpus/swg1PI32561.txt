 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are using the CICS Configuration Manager for z/OS (CICSCM)
   ISPF panelid CCVPACIM to manage CICSCM configuration, and the
   connection field is protected. When you Max and PF8 to the
   bottom, the last 2 rows on the panel do not display .
   
   A terminal emulator that does not display a minimum of 23 lines
   in the body of the ISPF panel is being used. This can be due to
   running in ISPF split screen mode on a 24x80 screensize or
   having PFSHOW ON with 2 rows of PF keys on a 24x80 screen.

 *  Ensure your screen displays a minimum of 23 rows by doing each
   of the following:
   
   - Configure your 3270 emulator to use a larger screen size that
   displays more the 23 rows in the body of the ISPF panel.
   Standard 3270 screen sizes are:
   
           24x80
           32x80
           43x80
           27x132
   
   - Exit ISPF split screen.
   - Enter the ISPF PFSHOW OFF command to free up 1 or more
   display lines if PF keys were displayed.

   1. The CICS Configuration Manager for z/OS ISPF dialog panel
      CCVPACIM edits CICS Configuration definitions for CSD files.
      When this panel is displayed on a 24 line, 80 column device
      with the user function key settings displayed at the bottom
      of the screen (PFSHOW ON), then only 22 lines of the panel
      are visible. The list of related Connection definitions
      commencing on panel line 23 is obscured by the function key
      display, and it is not possible to make them visible by
      scrolling or other viewing options.
   
   
   2. For CICS Configuration Manager v5.1, the copyright notices
      appearing in the ISPF online dialog invocation message, and
      'About CICS Configuration Manager' online help topic,
      and stamped into ongoing execution component changes require
      updating to reflect the change to calendar year 2015.
      The corresponding changes for CICS Configuration Manager v5.2
      were made in APAR PI32070 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI32070]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. CICS Configuration Manager for z/OS is corrected. The layout
      of the ISPF panels used for viewing and editing CICS
      Configuration definitions is adjusted.
      The list of Connections in panel CCVPACIM now appears on
      panel line 21, and is viewable on a 24 x 80 screen device,
      with PFSHOW set ON.
   
   2. The CICS Configuration Manager v5.1 copyright notices have
       been updated.
