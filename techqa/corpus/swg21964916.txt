 Apache HttpComponents that are vulnerable to spoofing attacks are affecting Case Manager Client. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Apache HttpComponents that are being utilized by the Forms widget in Case Manager Client when you are working with IBM Forms are vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]

DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
