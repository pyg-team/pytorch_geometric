Title: IBM Disposition of the Cipher.txt file in Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2.x - United States

Text:
Cipher.txt TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What happened to the Cipher.txt file in Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2.x? 

CAUSE
With Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.1.x, you could use the Cipher.txt file in the /ndm/bin folder to exclude the cipher suites you did not want to appear in the selection field in Secure+. You could edit this file to show only your preferences.
When you upgrade to Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2.x, the Cipher.txt file is still in the /ndm/bin folder but your cipher suite selections in Secure+ are no longer agreeing with the contents of the file.
Also, if you do a new install of Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2.x, the Cipher.txt file is no longer present.


ANSWER
With the introduction of Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2, Secure+ was redesigned - STS support was removed, new cipher suites were added, and a filter function was added to the cipher suite selection process in the Secure+ Admin tool.
The function of the Cipher.txt file was removed from Connect:Direct for UNIX v4.2.x and is no longer used by Secure+ to limit the selection of cipher suites presented.
