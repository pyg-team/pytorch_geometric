ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In WLE 7.2 with FP1 I have configured Exposed Process Variables
   and exposed them to a Participant Group. When a member of that
   group logs on to Process Admin, they do not see and cannot
   configure or update the EPVs. Jason Hackett EmeriCon
   imported the partner's twx file
   exposed the user tw_user to the EPV
   logged in to the Process Admin Console as tw_user -> no option
   was present to modify the EPV
   exposed the user tw_admin to the EPV - logged in to the Process
   Admin console as tw_admin -> was able to access the EPV
   added tw_user to the tw_admins group - logged in to the Process
   Admin console as tw_user -> was now able to access the EPV
