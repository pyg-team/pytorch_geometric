ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To fix syndication problems in the future objectid properties
   were set for the Content Targeting Dialog portlet and page in
   WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.1 CF15.
   
   Also for WebSphere Portlal 8.5 CF05 there were objectid
   properties added.
   
   The drawback of this is when attempting to syndicate with a
   previous Server version they will fail as the objectids will
   be different because they were generated dynamically by
   WebSphere Portal during install.
