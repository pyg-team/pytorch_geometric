ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCAPI - Creating the $NCHOME variable breaks probe functionality
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Unset $NCHOME environment variable setting
   
     In relation to that APAR IV51944, the documentation was
   updated as follows:
   
   Immediately a known issue was created which documented the
   problem:
   
   Setting the OMNIbus NCHOME variable can result in errors
   Symptom:
   Setting NCHOME may cause the probe to point to the wrong
   location and not run.
   No SCA-PI alarms will appear in the AEL.
   You may see the nco_p_stdin process on the SCA-PI Analytics
   component server has status of "defunct".
   Cause:
   This environment variable specifies the home location for Tivoli
   Netcool/OMNIbus.
   It is not mandatory that you manually set this environment
   variable before running the Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus installation
   program.
   Resolution:
   If your OMNIbus and your SCA-PI Analytics component are on the
   same server AND owned by the same user, do not set this
   variable.
   This is in line with OMNIbus documentation - search for "Setting
   Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus environment variables (UNIX and Linux)".
   
   The installation guide sections describing install of
   prerequisites have all been updated to have a caveat describing
   how they should be used, for example:
   
   Document caveat
   This installation guide provides a shortened version of the
   Netcool/OMNIbus installation process.
   Note: It must be noted the installation process prescribed in
   this documentation is not meant to replace the product-specific
   documentation. The installation process here contained for
   Netcool/OMNIbus has been provided for the convenience of the
   end-user and should only be used if:
   You are performing a basic install of Netcool/OMNIbus, accepting
   all the default options.
   You are performing a trial installation of the SmartCloud
   Analytics - Predictive Insights product.
   You must consult the official DB2 documentation if:
   You intend to use extra options or steps that are not the
   default as described in this document.
   You intend to install multiple instances of the required product
   The official and complete Installation and administration
   information for Netcool/OMNIbus can be found in the IBM Tivoli

   All references to changing or updating NC_HOME have now been
   removed from the docs:
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *      Fixed in PI release 1203 in June 2013 by defect 4154.
   
   
       The OMNIbus installation section has been updated to hold
   the details of the existing technote, and now reads:
   
   Note: Please note that setting the OMNIbus NCHOME variable can
   result in errors.If your OMNIbus and your SCA-PI Analytics
   component are on the same server and owned by the same user, do
   not set this variable. This is in line with theOMNIbus
   documentation section "Setting Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus
   environment variables (UNIX and Linux)".
     The NCHOME environment variable specifies the home location
   for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus. Setting NCHOME may cause the probe
   to point to the wrong location and not run.
