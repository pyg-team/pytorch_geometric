 * CVE-2017-15706: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the incorrect documentation of the CGI search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. 
 * CVE-2018-1304: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraint definitions that contain a URL pattern of "" (the empty string) that exactly maps to the context root. 
 * CVE-2018-1305: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraints that are defined by annotations of Servlets in certain cases. 
 * CVE-2018-1323: Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of HTTP request paths in jk_isapi_plugin.c.
