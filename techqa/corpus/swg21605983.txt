Title: IBM ITCAM for SOA HTTP response code 505 when connecting to DataPower - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the ITCAM for SOA data collector is not collecting data from a WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance, review the ITCAM for SOA operations log for error messages. The error messages may include an HTTP 505 response code message that indicates a path configuration issue. 

SYMPTOM
The ITCAM for SOA data collector operations log contains the following error messages: 

 * KD4DP0004E The data collector could not retrieve a domain list for DataPower appliance: <datapower_hostname> using userid ID: <datapower_userid> 
 * Detailed error message: class java.io.IOException Server returned HTTP response code: 505 for URL: https://<datapower_hostname>:5550<path> 
 * java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 505 for URL https://<datapower_hostname>:5550<path> [https://isoappgwt1:5550ibmitm/]


CAUSE
The DataPower.path property for the ITCAM for SOA data collector may be improperly configured, for example:

DataPower.path.1=<path>

where <path> is the path in the HTTP response code 505 message shown in the Symptom section above.


ENVIRONMENT
When configuring the ITCAM for SOA data collector to collect from DataPower, there is an opportunity to provide Path information along with hostname, port, userid and password. The default for Path is a forward slash.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Data entered during ITCAM for SOA data collection is written to a configuration file, for example, 

IBM\ITM\TMAITM6\KD4\config\KD4.dpdcConfig.properties. Review the properties file to confirm that there is a DataPower.path.n entry that contains <path> rather than the forward slash shown below: 

 *  DataPower.count=1
   DataPower.host.1=l<datapower_hostname>
   DataPower.port.1=5550
   DataPower.path.1=/
   DataPower.poll.1=10
   DataPower.user.1=<datapower_userid>
   DataPower.encpswd.1=<datapower_encoded_password>
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If a DataPower.path.n setting is not a simple forward slash as shown in the example above, change the properties file so that the path has the default setting: a forward slash. The ITCAM for SOA data collector should react to the changed property value without requiring a restart.
