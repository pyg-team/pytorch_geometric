PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Upgrading to Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (ECM SM) 5.2.0.002 and attempting to install and update Cala Client from Server is failing.

CAUSE
When updating CALA using the task "Install and Update CALA", never use:


 * Update configuration settings


This option uses the so called Mass Installation facility. It was developed to install CALA on a large amount of servers using configuration files rather than configuring each FileNet system manually to ECM SM. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Try updating CALA using the task "Install and Update CALA", by using options:


 * Update binaries 
 * Update monitor archives 
 * Keep monitor settings
