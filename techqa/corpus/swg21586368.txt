QUESTION
 How can I setup the Taskmaster Web Client Service to automate the upload of web scan batches? 

ANSWER
1. Install the Taskmaster Web Service by running Setup.exe found in the \Datacap\support\WebClientService folder.
2. Double click on \Datacap\tmclient\dc2Run.exe.config. This will allow you to configure the parameters used by this service.

3. The dc2Run.exe.config file has a section for a ShortcutIndex. You can determine what index value corresponds to what shortcut by looking it up in the Buttons Table of the Administrator Database. Update this index to run the upload shortcut..

4. In the dc2Run_localhost_utility section of the dc2Run.exe.config file change the server from “localhost” to your server name or IP address.

5. Update the application name in the Application Settings section of the file to specify your application name.

6. Update the user name in the user section to the user you want to log in and run the upload task.

7. Upload the station name in the station section from “remote” to the station you want the service to log in with.

8. Add the following xml text into the tabs.xml file which is located in the \Datacap\tmclient folder:

<section name="dc2run">
<key.named.list name="Users" kxp="dc2run/?" itemname="User" valuemask="{0}">
<pwd name="password" kxp=":pwd" tip="Set passwords for upload service user"/>
</key.named.list>
</section>

6. Launch DCOrchard.exe whose executable is located in the \Datacap\tmclient folder:
There will be a new tab called dc2run. Under this tab add your user and password which will be used to log into the service with. The user name and password are stored in the applications .app file with the password encrypted.

Note: The user name needs to match the user name that was configured in the dc2Run.exe.config file.

8. To test the uploading of batch first log into Taskmaster Web, scan can at least one batch, and then start the Web Client Service from the Window Services Control Manager. The station that you use to create batches that will be uploaded by the Web Client Service have to be created logged in as the same station that is configured in the dc2Run.exe.config file. 

9. After you start the Web Client Service, confirm that the batches have been uploaded.
