Text:
"Lotus Connections" component; web access; com.ibm.websphere.servlet.error.ServletErrorReport: Filter [UserDataConstraintFilter]: could not be initialized.; Unable to find configuration with id: LotusConnections; Check logs for XML schema validation errors. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When a user tries to access Homepage, or any other Lotus Connections component, the browser displays the following error: 

 * 
 * "Oops, that didn't work. Something went wrong - click the back button and try again."


Clicking "Show full error message" reports the error:  * com.ibm.websphere.servlet.error.ServletErrorReport: Filter [UserDataConstraintFilter]: could not be initialized.

SYMPTOM
WebSphere Application Server's SystemOut.log file will show something similar: 

 

 * [12/4/08 8:28:23:718 EST] 0000001e VenturaConfig E org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger error CLFRO2002E: com.ibm.ventura.internal.config.VenturaConfigurationProviderImpl Unable to find configuration with id: LotusConnections
 * 
 * [12/4/08 8:28:23:781 EST] 0000001e AbstractAuthF E org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger error There was an issue with the LotusConnections-config. Check logs for XML schema validation errors
 * .


CAUSE
The LotusConnections-config.xml file is missing from the following WebSphere Application Server directory: 


 * 
 * profiles\<profile name>\config\cells\<cell name>\LotusConnections-config
 * 


Please note: This file is also case sensitive, and you may see similar issues if the file exists but is not staying true to case. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In one reported case, the LotusConnections-config.xml file had been moved out of the proper directory. In addition this problem may occur if the customer has placed a backup or duplicate copy of the LCC.xml in the same directory. 

Locating and replacing the file, removing all duplicate copies, in the correct file system location resolved the issue.
