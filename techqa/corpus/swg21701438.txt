Title: IBM ITM Server Dashboard Widget drill down results in message "CTJSD303I" - United States

Text:
Server Dashboard Widget CTJSD303I TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does ITM Server Dashboard result in error when navigating to non-OS Managed System widgets? 

CAUSE

The Server Dashboard Managed System group only support drill down into the agent health metrics reports for the Operating System widgets such as the Windows OS agent, UNIX OS agent, and Linux OS agent systems. The Non-Operating System agent widgets provide only event related reports.

This is consistent with the drill down informational message,
"Data cannot be displayed for this managed system CTJSD303I"

Subsequent click on the error expands the error box and the following message in shown:
"The monitoring agent is not supported in this release. Please launch into the Tivoli Enterprise Portal through the Actions menu to open the default workspace for <Managed System> "



ANSWER
 

The Server Dashboard Managed System Group overview show widgets corresponding to all the monitored system types in the environment.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=1] 

Select the ALL_UNIX Manage System widget provide a drill down report view showing the overall health of those systems, 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=2] 


From there you can drill down to an individual server and navigate to a set reports tabs that provide a rich set of health check metrics, 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=3] 

However, if you select a non-OS agent Managed System widget such as the MS_NET Frameworks or the VMWare ESX servers, etc.. you will be met with the information message shown below, 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701438&aid=4]
