Title: IBM My java application is failing with the exception, "No Suitable Driver". - United States

Text:
no suitable driver DB2 JCC JDBC java connect connection URL class name TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My java application is failing with the exception, "No Suitable Driver". 

SYMPTOM
java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver 


CAUSE
This occurs when either the incorrect driver class name or more typically the JDBC database URL passed is not properly constructed or incorrect permission to access the driver jar files. 

When a Connection request is issued, the Driver Manager asks each loaded driver if it understands the URL sent. If no driver responds that it understands the URL, then the "No Suitable Driver" message is returned. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Verify following steps: 

1) Ensure your application is configured properly with the appropriate driver files included in the CLASSPATH environment setting. 

 *  db2java.zip for the Legacy Type 2 driver db2jcc.jar for the Universal and Data Server driver for JDBC 

Check that the proper implementation class name is used.  *  COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver for the legacy Type 2 driver from db2java.zip com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver for the Universal JCC driver from db2jcc.jar 

And check that the URL syntax is correct for the connection  *  jdbc:db2:<dbalias> for the Legacy Type 2 driver connection jdbc:db2://<hostname>:<port>/<database> for the Universal and Data Server driver for JDBC. 

Note: db2java.zip support has been discontinued as of v10.1, see DB2 JDBC Type 2 Driver is discontinued [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_10.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.wn.doc/doc/i0058719.html].  

2) Check if you have DB2 Extended security enabled on the DB2 Client using the command: 

 * 
 * 
 * If enabled, the output will show: 
   [g] DB2_EXTSECURITY=YES
   
   If so, make sure the application userID is part of DB2ADMNS or DB2USERS groups in Windows
