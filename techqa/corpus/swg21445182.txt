 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 To create a Purchase Order in JD Edwards server successfully with executing Business Functions F311FSBeginDoc, F4311EditLine and F4311EndDoc in a batch by WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, keep the mnTransactionID the same for F311FSBeginDoc, F4311EditLine and F4311EndDoc. 

CAUSE
When executed Business Functions F311FSBeginDoc, F4311EditLine and F4311EndDoc in batch by WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne to create a Purchase Order in JD Edwards server, there were no records generated in the JD Edwards server. 

The mnTransactionID populated by F311FSBeginDoc was changed in F4311EditLine and F4311EndDoc.


ANSWER
Set the attribute level ASI 'Reference' for mnTransactionID in F4311EditLine and F4311EndDoc to get the mnTransactionID value from the execution result of F311FSBeginDoc, then the Purchase Order record will be generated properly in the JD Edwards server. 

Example: <jdeasi:Reference>F4311FSBeginDoc/Mntransactionid</jdeasi:Reference>
