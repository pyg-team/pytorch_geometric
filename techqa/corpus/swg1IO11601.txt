ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   ********************
   
   Customer stated :
   
   I have a html page which is set up to encrypt/decrypt strings
   entered in by a user using tea encryption. this form calls a
   javascript in the source and works perfectly.
   I have copied this script exactly into a new script in TDI and
   in my
   AL I am calling the same function from that script and passing
   the
   string to encrypt and the key encrypt with.
   I am passing the same data into it as i do from the html page
   yet it
   wont process properly and wont give me a correct result. no
   matter
   what string and key I pass i get the same weird wrong result.
   gaaaiaaa......
   Everything is the same except one is run in html one in TDI, how
   would
   I set TDI to process javascript just the same as the html does.
   I believe it is slight differences in how html and TDI interpret
   javascript.
   What is my best option here to get this running correctly.
   I am calling the encrypt function, I will not need this script
   to
   decrypt as this is done in another application.
   
   
   Action Taken : L3 has provided code fix which could not be
   ************** tested by Customer, however it's a valid code
   fix.
