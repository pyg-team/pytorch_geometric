QUESTION
 Why has the format of the MEMFILE cache file name changed after applying 9.1 Fix Pack 6? 

CAUSE
A fix was included in 9.1 Fix Pack 6 that changes the MEMFILE cache file name. This is to be consistent with version 11.3

ANSWER
Prior to 9.1 Fix Pack 6, the MEMFILE cache file name uses the format lkp##########, where ########## is an integer value. 

After applying 9.1 Fix Pack 6, the MEMFILE cache file name uses the format ODPP.Pxxxxxxxx.Tyyyyyyyy.lkp where xxxxxxxx and yyyyyyyy are hex values.
