Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on October 15, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Cognos Metrics Manager. IBM Cognos Metrics Manager has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-3567 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak when handling failed session ticket integrity checks. By sending an overly large number of invalid session tickets, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server. 
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3513 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the DTLS Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension parsing code. By sending multiple specially-crafted handshake messages, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server. 
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3568 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker bypass security restrictions. When configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
