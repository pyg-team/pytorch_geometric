APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   When using Remote Deploy to "upgradeagent" the NT agent on an
   endpoint where there is no valid C: Drive, the remote deploy
   will fail stating the C:\IBM\ITM is an invalid directory. The
   Remote Deploy install is not recognizing that the product is
   already installed on another drive so it tests path C:\IBM\ITM.
   On a machine that does not have a C: drive this test will fail.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   
   To recreate this problem a machine without a C: drive is
   required.  Windows can be installed on a NON C: drive, but if
   the C: drive exists the test will pass and the agent will be
   installed on the NON C: drive. However, if the C: Drive does
   not exist, the test will fail and the agent will not upgrade
   when it should.
   
   Environment:
   
   Windows any version where Remote Deploy is being used to
   upgrade the NT agent on the endpoint where ITM is installed on
   a NON C: drive and the C: drive does not exist. This failure
   may also occur for any agent upgraded with the "tacmd
   updateagent" command or by requesting an upgrade to an agent
   through TEPS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix:
   
   In the Depot of the deploy machine, edit the
   NT_Silent_Install.txt file and change the Install Directory
   from C:\IBM\ITM to the location of where ITM is really
   installed. This will allow the test for the NON C: drive to
   pass and the NT agent will be upgraded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Windows silent install (including Remote Deploy) may fail if the
   install directory inside the silent install file points to a
   drive that does not exist on the target system.  This occurs if
   Windows is not installed on the C: drive and the C: drive does
   not exist for the target system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed test to verify that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring registry
   key and values exist.  If registry key
   HKLM\Software\Candle\Omegamon exists and it has a Directory
   value present then we know IBM Tivoli Monitoring has been
   installed and the install does not need to test for a valid
   install directory.
