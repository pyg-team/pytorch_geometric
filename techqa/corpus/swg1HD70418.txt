     Check also if another user is using the file. Contact your
     System Administrator to obtain the correct permission.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   SMARTEAM
   SmarTeam viewer open various files and viewers,
   each of them is different by the size and memory
   use he needs to view file.
   When the tab viewer is clicked, a file is being
   temporarily copied to the file system, and then
   begins a loading process.
   This process may be quick or a bit slow for
   different size of files, and different viewers.
   When user select a different object to view, a
   deleting process start immediately for the viewed
   file.
   From time to time, the file still not finish its closing
   by its host application while SmarTeam viewer
   trying to delete the file.
   In this case the file is locked by the application and
   SmarTeam failing to delete it.
   We advice our customers to be patient switching
   objects while viewing them, as any other
   application loading, deleting, opening and
   presenting  images.
   When these processes are disturbed and not
   completed, an error appears.
   The viewer must delete the file before presenting
   another one, but he cannot delete the file while
   loading it.
   To avoid this error- please wait until file is
   completely loaded in the viewer, before switching
   to another object.
