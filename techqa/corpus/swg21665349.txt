QUESTION
 Does ITCAM Extended agent for Oracle Database support local monitoring on Oracle Exadata platforms? 

CAUSE
Oracle Exadata platform is not listed in the agent support matrix.

ANSWER
ITCAM Extended agent support for Oracle Exadata depends on the operating system it is using. 

At the time of publishing this technote, Oracle Exadata platform support is available as follows:

1. ITCAM Extended Oracle monitoring agent can monitor Oracle instances running on a remote host. Therefore, you can install the agent on one of the supported host operating systems, and configure it to remotely monitor Oracle instance running on a remote Exadata host.

2. If using Oracle Solaris, currently Solaris 11 Sparc is certified for the ITCAM Extended Oracle agent. The Extended monitoring agent for Oracle can be installed locally on this system. This is the only certified Oracle Exadata platform at this time. For other Exadata platforms, read the discussion below.

3. If using Oracle Linux, and you want to install the ITCAM agent locally, then you must first contact IBM support. See explanation below:
Oracle Exadata operating systems are customized for Oracle. This requires that the ITCAM monitoring agent has to be specifically certified on these platforms to be installed, configured, and run locally.

Refer to the Oracle Linux documentation at links below

Determine if Oracle Linux is installed, as described in pdf link above. Files to look for may be:
/etc/redhat-release (from RedHat)
/etc/oracle-release (from Oracle) 

The uname may look like the following:
2.6.39-400.126.1.el5uek

The "uek" stands for Unbreakable Enterprise kernel. See section Kernel and Driver update in the link below:
https://oss.oracle.com/el5/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-U7-en.html [https://oss.oracle.com/el5/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-U7-en.html] 

The Oracle Linux is not certified for local installation of ITCAM Extended Oracle agent. A special request form needs to be submitted to the ITCAM product manager, with a request to certify the agent on the Oracle platform. IBM support facilitates submission of the request.

If Oracle adds other operating systems to Exadata, those will also require contacting IBM support for certification of the agent for local installation.
