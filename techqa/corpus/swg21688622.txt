Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects Identity Insight (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in Identity Insight. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Identity Insight 8.1 and 8.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
SSLv3 should be disabled on WebSphere Application Server that is deployed with Identity Insight to remove the POODLE vulnerability. Settings below will turn off TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 which are vulnerable. This mitigation will be replaced by a WebSphere fix when it is available.

Server configuration file:
The SSL protocol is set in the sslProtocol variable in the security.xml file. Edit the security.xml file and replace the reference to 'SSL_TLS' with 'TLS' for the sslProtocol setting. This needs to be done for each security.xml file in the configuration.

Client configuration files:
The SSL protocol is set with the com.ibm.ssl.protocol property in the ssl.client.props file. Edit the ssl.client.props file and set the com.ibm.ssl.protocol value to TLS (was SSL_TLS). This needs to be done for each ssl.client.props file in the configuration.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3.
