im; updi TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you apply interim fixes and fix packs for WebSphere Process Server (WPS) Version 7.0, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) Version 7.0, and for the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Version 7.5 products using the Update Installer utility (UPDI), you can cause inconsistencies with Installation Manager.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not use Update Installer utility (UPDI) to apply interim fixes and fix packs for WebSphere Process Server (WPS) Version 7.0, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) Version 7.0, and for the IBM Business Process Manager Version 7.5 products. Apply updates to these products using IBM Installation Manager only. 

Interim fixes for WebSphere Application Server, which are embedded within these products, are commonly available in the Update Installer .pak format. However, applying these fixes using Update Installer can cause inconsistencies with Installation Manager and lead to problems. 

The Update Installer utility is meant only for WebSphere Application Server administration. While this is satisfactory for a standalone product, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, and the IBM Business Process Manager products require additional Installation Manager functionality to orchestrate fixes and make future updates smoother. 

The Update Installer utility is not included as part of these products. Documentation for these stacked products instruct you to use Installation Manager and do not instruct you to use the Update Installer utility. 

To install an interim fix for the underlying WebSphere Application Server infrastructure, which is included in the WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, and IBM Business Process Manager product fix packs, see the following fix lists. These fix lists include a link to the associated WebSphere Application Server Fix Pack, which lists the interim fixes that are included. Install the WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, or IBM Business Process Manager product fix pack that includes the desired WebSphere Application Server interim fix. See the following fix lists: 

 * WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Version 7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27017312] 
 * IBM Business Process Manager Version 7.5 products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022242]


For example, in your environment, you might be using WebSphere Process Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 3, which uses WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 11. However, you need WebSphere Application Server interim fix for APAR PM22090, which is included WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 17. WebSphere Process Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 4 uses WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0. Fix Pack 17. Thus, you can upgrade from WebSphere Process Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 3 to Fix Pack 4 and receive the included fix for WebSphere Application Server APAR PM22090. Note: An exception to this recommendation is during the first upgrade of an original WebSphere Process Server or WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Version 7.0.0.0 installation to a higher level. In this specific case, use the Update Installer Utility to remove the following fixes that are included in the initial Version 7.0.0.0 installation:


 * SDKPM00452.pak 
 * 7.0.0.7-WS-WAS-<platform><arch>-IFPK98944.pak 

Refer to the specific fix pack installation instructions for more details. RELATED INFORMATION
