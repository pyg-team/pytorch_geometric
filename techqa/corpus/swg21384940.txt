Title: IBM InfoSphere Enterprise Records - auto declaration fails with BDSException error - United States

Text:
RMAutoDeclare; BDSException; auto declare; declaration fails TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Auto declaration of Records using the RMAutoDeclare event fails with a BDSException error. 

SYMPTOM
Documents created using a document class that has a subscription configured for the RMAutoDeclare event do not get declared as records. 

When reviewing the FileNet Content Engine p8_server_error.log, the following exception is noted: 

Exception occurred during execution phase 1 of batch
Caused by: com.filenet.rm.bds.exception.BDSException: Exception occurred during execution phase 1 of batch 'DeclareEvent'. (100503)\n at com.filenet.rm.bds.integration.BDPIntegrationFacade.executeJob(BDPIntegrationFacade.java:1196)\n at com.filenet.rm.bds.integration.BatchImpl.execute(BatchImpl.java:256)\n at com.filenet.rm.bds.impl.BaseBulkServiceImpl.executeBatch(BaseBulkServiceImpl.java:225)\n at com.filenet.rm.ceintegration.eventhandler.declareoperation.impl.BDSDeclareAsRecordImpl.declare(BDSDeclareAsRecordImpl.java:144)\n at com.filenet.rm.ceintegration.eventhandler.Declare.doDeclare(Declare.java:176)\n ... 23 more


CAUSE
The target Record Class may have properties that require a value on Record creation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Check if the target Record class in the File Plan Object Store has any properties that require a value.
    
    
 2.  Using IBM FileNet P8 Enterprise Manager, right click the specific Record class, then the Properties Definitions tab.
    
    
 3. Leaving the System Properties option unchecked, click on each property listed and choose Edit. 
    
    
 4. Click the More tab and notice if Value Required is checked.
    
    
 5. Either the Record Class definition should be modified as to not require a value or the RMAutoDeclare.properties should specify a property from the source document that can be used to populate the required value.
