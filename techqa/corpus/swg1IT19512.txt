APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An additional step for rolling back an MQ Appliance firmware
   from 9.x to 8.x is missing from the MQ Knowledge Center. When
   rolling back the firmware, it is necessary to remove the 'no
   force-mode' attribute from each physical ethernet interface
   stanza found within the config:autoconfig.cfg folder. Failure
   to remove this attribute will result in a 'Notice: startup
   config contains errors.' warning on reboot.
   
   When a user login to the MQ appliance after downgrade the
   following message with a Notice at the end will be displayed.

   Notice: startup config contains errors.

   The startup-errors log file contains the following error
   messages:

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the 'no force-mode' attribute from each physical
   ethernet interface stanza found within the
   config:autoconfig.cfg folder after the downgrade from 9.x.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users downgrading/switching MQ appliance from MQ 90x to MQ 8.0
   and referencing the section "Reverting to the previous level of
   firmware" in the MQ infocenter.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When downgrading/switching MQ appliance to previous level or
   older level might result in startup config errors if the
   autoconfig contains any new attribute added at higher MQ
   applinace level, but not present at lower MQ level. The problem
   can be resolved  by executing the command "write memory" after
   rebooting the MQ appliance and then rebooting the MQ appliance
   again. MQ knowledge center needs to be modified to add these
   additional steps.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following sections of the MQ Appliance knowledge center will
   be updated to describe the necessary steps to downgrade the
   firmware:
   
   
   Topic URL MQ 8.0 :
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5K6E_1.0.0/com.
   ibm.mqa.doc/upgrading/up00002_.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5K6E_1.0.0/com.ibm.mqa.doc/upgrading/up00002_.htm]
   Topic URL MQ 9.0.x :
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5K6E_9.0.0/com.
   ibm.mqa.doc/upgrading/up00002_.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5K6E_9.0.0/com.ibm.mqa.doc/upgrading/up00002_.htm]
   
   Note that queue managers which have been started on a later
   major firmware version will not be eligible to run with an
   earlier version, even if the firmware is reverted.
