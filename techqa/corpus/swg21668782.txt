PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Workplace XT login error - A system error has occurred 

SYMPTOM
From a client station, attempting to login to Workplace XT returns a pop-up window with the following message: 


A system error has occurred

The WebSphere SystemOut.log file on the Workplace XT server showed the following messages:

[3/27/14 10:35:17:434 EDT] 00000044 CSIv2Effectiv W JSAS1479W: The target realm [abcd.Local:636] does not match the current realm [abcd.local:636]. Specify the target realm in the Trusted target realms field. From the AdminConsole, go to: Security -> Global Security -> RMI/IIOP security -> CSIv2 Outbound Authentication.

[3/27/14 10:35:32:025 EDT] 00000044 servlet E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception created in one of the service methods of the servlet /WcmDefault.jsp in application WorkplaceXT. Exception created : com.ibm.websphere.servlet.error.ServletErrorReport: com.filenet.wcm.api.RemoteServerException: com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException&#59;The JNDI cannot be accessed. [Code=null]&#59; OMFC/TheNetwork/NoOp//API_UNEXPECTED_JNDI_ERROR



CAUSE
The realm name defined in WebSphere on the Workplace XT server did not match the realm name defined in WebSphere on the CE server. The realm names are case sensitive, so "Local" would not match "local".


ENVIRONMENT
XT 1.1.5
CE 5.1
WAS 7.0
Windows 2008
MS AD




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The correct realm name with the correct case sensitivity needs to be configured in the WebSphere.



On both the XT and CE servers, open the WebSphere Administrative console and check for the incorrect realm name in the following locations: 

 1.  Security
     
     
 2.  Global Security
     
     
 3.  User account repository (Standalone or Federated LDAP) - Configure...Standalone:
     
     
     Check the Host and DN settings
     
     
     Federated:
     
     
     Check the Realm name
     
     
 4.  Security
     
     
 5.  Global Security
     
     
 6.  Authentication - RMI/IIOP security
     
     
 7.  CSIv2 outbound communications
     
     
 8.  Related Items - Trusted authentication realms - outbound
     
     
 9.  Security > Global Security
     
     
 10. Authentication - RMI/IIOP security > CSIv2 inbound communications
     
     
 11. Related Items - Trusted authentication realms - inbound
     
     
 12. Correct any misspelling in the Realms section
