ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   Approver Initials:    bs
   Severity:             2

   ABSTRACT:             TIP/TBSM charts receiving read timeout
   error in TIP UI
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   ================
   When running the ITM HTTP web service to retrieve data from the
   TIP/TBSM UI in the tip server, the ITM workspace retrievel
   throws a read timeout error  resulting in no data or charts
   visualized in the TIP UI.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==================
   Run the TIP/TBSM product which retireves ITM workspace
   definitions and data from the Tivoli Portal database. Create
   some custom navigator items and workspaces via the Tivoli
   Portal client. Attempt to retrieve these workspaces using the
   tip/tbsm client and run the data requests to try and render the
   workspace definitions. It's possible to get a read timeout
   error in the TIP UI if the request is being sent to many agents
   on the ITM side.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TBSM/BIRT Reports in Tivoli Integrated Portal can fail with a
   read timeout error when requesting data from IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring agents.
   
   
   Data requests from the Tivoli Integrated Portal to IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring can timeout if too many agents are queried at one
   time.  If the data request is sent to all agents of a particular
   group, either non responding agents or SQL size restrictions can
   be encountered when the amount of agents exceeds 100.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed the TIPHttpWebService application deployed in the Tivoli
    Enterprise Portal Server eWAS to use the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
   managed system list in the data request instead of trying to
   string together all agents of one group into the same "OR"
   clause in the SQL executed at the monitoring server.
