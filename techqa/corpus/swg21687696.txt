QUESTION
 Verbose GC trace could provide more detail information about how Garbage Collector take action, it is very helpful for diagnosing performance issue. Verbose GC is not enabled by default, how could we enable it for CDC? 

ANSWER
Steps of how to enable GC trace for CDC:
1. Stop all subscriptions
2. Stop CDC instance which you want to enable GC trace.
3. Backup the file <cdc_install_dir>/conf/dmts64.vmargs to dmts64.vmargs.bak , then we can recover it by replacing the file with dmts64.vmargs.bak if we want to disable GC trace.
4. Edit the file <cdc_install_dir>/conf/dmts64.vmargs by adding the following line in front of the content
-Xverbosegclog:/<directory>/verbosegc.txt
For example:
before add the GC trace log, the content of the file should be like this
-Dcom.datamirror.ts.instance=%TSINSTANCE% com.datamirror.ts.commandlinetools.script.Startup
after add the GC trace log, the content of the file should be like this
-Xverbosegclog:/opt/cdc/ReplicationEngineforOracle/log/verbosegc.txt -Dcom.datamirror.ts.instance=%TSINSTANCE% com.datamirror.ts.commandlinetools.script.Startup

5. Start the CDC instance
6. Start all subscriptions
7. Collect the GC trace from the directory you specified in the file, e.g. /opt/cdc/ReplicationEngineforOracle/log/verbosegc.txt
