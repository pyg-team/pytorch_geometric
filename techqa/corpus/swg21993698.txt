PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 "ClassNotFoundException:com.ibm.tivoli.maximo.report.applet.quickprint.SilentPrint" in Maximo v7.6 when using Direct Print 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Some clients may have a business need to configure SSL* on their network to further secure it. When clients configure SSL version TLS 1.2**(on their webserver), it causes the following error msg (when using Direct Print capability of Maximo v7.6 application): 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993698&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993698&aid=1]

To resolve this error message and enable direct print capability in Maximo, the user should revert back to TLS 1.0.

NOTES: 

*TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are protocols that provide data encryption and authentication between applications and servers in scenarios where that data is being sent across an insecure network.

**Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message. TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
