PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an LDAP authentication issue that can occur when migrating from Rational Team Concert 1.0.0.1 to Rational Team Concert 2.0. 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to authenticate with an LDAP server using the Web client, users will receive the message: 

 * 
 * "An error was encountered attempting to fetch the authenticated user from the repository. This is often caused by a problem connecting to the database. Please contact your administrator."


And the server log will include a number of errors such as:  * 
 * CRJAZ1093I Service failed to activate.
   
   CRJAZ1092I The service class "com.ibm.team.repository.service.internal.
   schemagen.PersistentMappingService" failed during activation.
   
   CRJAZ0820I Failed to create the system schema.
   
   CRJAZ1141I Failed to get the service "com.ibm.team.repository.service.
   internal.IInternalContributorService".
   
   CRJAZ1092I The service class "com.ibm.team.repository.service.internal.
   schemagen.PersistentMappingService" failed during activation.
   
   CRJAZ1185I Cannot retrieve user "xxx@xx.ibm.com" because the repository is inaccessible. Logging in as "ADMIN". Check the configuration of the server.


CAUSE
Incorrect login ID and password. User logged in using login credentials other than Admin and attempted to import the repository. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must use the Admin ID and password when importing the repository.
