APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Creating a new Network Access Policy rule through the LMI allows
   one to enter an invalid CIDR-format subnet mask and successfully
   save the policy. This causes the inspection engine to fail to
   restart and in turn causes network failure.
   
   Affected audience: Users that mistype or otherwise enter an
   invalid CIDR-format subnet mask as part of a network access
   policy rule.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Exert extra caution when entering CIDR-format subnet masks
   (x.x.x.x/24) or use 255.x.x.x notation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Anyone that uses the LMI Network Access Policy menus to      *
   * create a rule with an invalid CIDR-format subnet mask.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * This issue can cause the inspection engine of the XGS        *
   * appliance to fail to operate, causing network failure.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Apply latest cumulative fixpack.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The patch provides tighter validation on CIDR-format subnet
   masks to prevent invalid entries such as 192.168.2.1/42.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Apply latest cumulative fixpack.
