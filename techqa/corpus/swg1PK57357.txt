ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The readme for 6.0.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_SVR-IF0003 misses the
   requirement to restart application servers with data collectors
   after applying 6.0.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_SVR-IF0003 to the managing
   server.
   If, after applying 6.0.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_SVR-IF0003 to the
   managing server, application servers with the data collectors
   currently connected to the managing server have not been
   restarted, the data collectors lose connection to the managing
   server and are not able to reconnect.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After applying 6.0.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_SVR-IF0003, application
   servers with the data collectors currently connected to the
   managing server must be restarted.
