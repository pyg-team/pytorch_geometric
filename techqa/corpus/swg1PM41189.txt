   ****************************************************************
   Using the was_common_configure_sibus to read and
   subsequently write MQ links or SIB links was failing as
   was_common_configure_sibus uses AdminConfig to write data
   back to WAS when it should have been using AdminTask to
   perform the write back to WAS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Properly capture SIB links and MQ links using
   was_common_configure_sibus in export mode.
   was_common_configure_sibus cannot be used in execute mode to
   write out the data, as AdminConfig is used instead of
   AdminTask, which is what should be used.  In order to write
   out the data base to WAS,
   was_common_configure_sibus_mq_links  or
   was_common_configure_sibus_sib_links  should be used
   instead, as they use AdminTask to write the data.
