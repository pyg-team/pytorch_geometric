Title: IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) in-flight instance migration fails if the running instances have tokens on the business process definition (BPD) or service-level components are removed in the new snapshot - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running instances that are being migrated have tokens on the BPD or service-level components are removed in the new version, the migration process might fail. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 Tokens indicate where a runtime instance is currently executing and a token can be present on an activity, a conditional sequence line, a coach, a service call, and numerous other components. You can still migrate the instances from the old snapshot to the new snapshot. However, the instances fail when you try to complete the missing activity.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In those cases, it might be preferable to allow existing in-flight instances to run against the old snapshot.
