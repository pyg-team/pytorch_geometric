PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to view TIFs and PDFs with Daeja Pro on IBM Content Navigator (ICN). Getting an error message "The document was not loaded" on ICN.

Server headless check has succeeded
WebContainer : 5 Aug 4, 2015 11:47:37 AM (000001128/000000005): ViewOnePlatform.navigator.streamer> document repository version file missing



CAUSE
The settings on both the iviewpro.streamer.properties file for Daeja and the same properties exist in the ICN desktop ViewOne settings do not match.

ENVIRONMENT
Daeja 4.1.x
ICN 2.0.3

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check streamer.log and look for "document repository version file missing"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Confirm that the settings in the iviewpro.streamer.properties file for Daeja and the same properties exist in the ICN Desktop ViewONE settings for all nodes should be applied. 




 1. To verify the ICN Desktop ViewONE settings, go to -> Setting (icon) -> Daeja ViewONE -> Document Streaming (tab) -> Additional Settings -> (Make sure the values are identical with the ones listed in iviewpro.streamer.properties or vice versa. Create new items if needed.) 
 2. Bounce the JVMs. 
 3. Verify the verify page at http://<host_name>:<port>/navigator/viewers/verify.jsp, and make sure everything is correct such that "Validity" shows "OK". 
 4. Display the images by launching the viewer.
