PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempt to upgrade an instance of IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus WebGUI version 7.3.1 FixPack 3 (FP3) that was installed using IBM Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) failed after hostname change. 

SYMPTOM
Change hostname of IBM Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) and attempt IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus FixPack 3 (FP3) installation


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus WebGUI version 7.3.1.x with IBM Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE), non-root instance

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the installation (IA) logs and you'll noticed that there are two DE instances were created using a single user, as a result of hostname change: 

Example:
1. /home/<username>/.acsi_hostname1 (the new/working copy)
2. /home/<username>/.acsi_hostname2 (the old copy, prior to hostname change)

Unfortunately, we should have only one instance of DE for a single user.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow the steps noted below to resolve this issue:

1. Rename .acsi_<hostname2> directory to .acsi_<hostname2>_OLD located at /home/<username>/.acsi_<hostname2> 

2. Create a softlink to .acsi_<hostname1> with hostname '<hostname2>' using below command : 

# ln -s /home/<username>/.acsi_<hostname1> /home/ncoadmin/.acsi_<hostname2> 

3. Re-attempt FP3 installation. Now, it should re-use the existing DE instead of creating new instance again.
