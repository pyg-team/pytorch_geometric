PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve a SQL0407N error, that can occur when doing an import or export in IBM Rational Build Forge. 

SYMPTOM
SQL0407N error is found in bfimport log: 

 * 
 * DBD::DB2::st execute failed: [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/NT]
   SQL0407N Assignment of a NULL value to a NOT NULL column
   "TBSPACEID=2, TABLEID=65, COLNO=1" SQLSTATE=23502 
   
   11368 /PerlApp/BuildForge/DB/db2.pm(BuildForge::DB::db2):65 
   11368 /PerlApp/BuildForge/Importer/Data/Project.pm
   (BuildForge::Importer::Data::Project [Data::Project]):195 
   11368 /PerlApp/BuildForge/Importer/XMLImporter.pm 
   (BuildForge::Importer::XMLImporter):350 
   2009/9/7 12:18:56 Database: 11368: 
   [execute] 
   Invalid argument at /PerlApp/BuildForge/Importer/Data/Project.pm line 
   317. 


CAUSE
If the value for name is of the form “TBSPACEID=n1, TABLEID=n2, COLNO=n3”, then the column name from the SQL statement was not available when the error was issued. The values provided identify the tablespace, table, and column number of the base table that does not allow NULL value

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this example, the problem is with Column 1, which is either bf_pid or bf_level. So it is likely level - the importer is trying to 

assign the imported project to an invalid access group. 

Make sure system configuration is set up correctly.In 
Administration->System, check the values of 

- Import Default Secure Access Group 
- Import Insecure Default Access Group

And make sure they contain values of access groups that actually existed

For other column ID is simliar error message, please contact IBM Rational BuildForge Support.
