QUESTION
What are the tips and known issues for Proventia Network Mail Security System (PNMSS) and Lotus Protector for Mail Security (LPMS)?

ANSWER
Known issues (applies to both LPMS 2.5 and PNMSS 2.5) 

 * You cannot use special characters, such as, single-quotes ('), double-quotes ("), left-brackets (<), right-brackets (>), or ampersand signs (&) in the name of any object within the policy engine. These special characters are no longer supported in version 2.5. Before you begin the migration of data to version 2.5, you must modify the names of objects containing any of these special characters. If a policy is shown as invalid after you have upgraded to version 2.5, check whether there are special characters in the name of an object. If special characters are present, you must rename the object using a name that does not contain one of the special characters, and then save the new policy. Even though a policy might be shown as invalid, the filter is still working correctly. This is an issue with the user interface, not with the filter engine. 
 * After you upgrade your system to Firmware 2.5, the mapping of physical ports 1, 2 , 3, 4 might change, in which case you will need to plug the network cable into a different port. 


Firmware 2.5 Firmware 1.8 
eth3 eth0 
eth2 eth1 
eth1 eth2 
eth0 eth3 The list on the left shows the interfaces that are configured for Firmware 2.5. The list on the right shows the interfaces that are used up to Firmware 1.8. 

The most typical setup uses only eth1. After you upgrade your system to Firmware 2.5, the cable from port eth1 needs to be plugged into the port that was previously used for eth2. 

 * You cannot use some non-ASCII characters (such as, Chinese 7C/5C characters) in all fields of the user interface. 
 * A static route might not be visible in the Local Management Interface (LMI) after a reboot of the system. The route will be configured and active on the machine. 


Known issues (applies to PNMSS 2.5 only)  * It is no longer possible to configure an IP address through the LCD panel on MS3004 appliances. You can still, however, configure an IP address through the LCD panel on MS3004N appliances. 
 * Due to a change in the licensing mechanism, you might receive a license key file when you extend your license. This is due to the processing mechanism and is not needed after you upgrade to Proventia Network Mail version 2.5. You do not need to upload this file to Proventia Network Mail. During the migration to version 2.5, the license will automatically be converted; no Administrator interaction is needed. 


Fixed issues (applies to both LPMS 2.5 and PNMSS 2.5)  * Fixed a possible crash of the CRM daemon when the Updates tab is displayed in the Local Management Interface (LMI). 
 * Joining a cluster is now possible with Internet Explorer 7. 
 * The SMTP log files are now written in hourly chunks to prevent files from becoming too large. 
 * The Apache Web Server was configured for better security. 


Known Issues (applies to v2.1)  * It may take up to 30 minutes to change the time zone of the appliance. 
 * For VMware: Saving the configuration in the Local Management Interface (LMI) under a high load may cause an error message that the service did not respond within 45 seconds. You should be able to save the configuration on the next attempt. 
 * It is not possible to create a cluster setup with Internet Explorer 6 or 7. As a workaround, you can use Firefox (2.x/3.0) to generate a cluster setup. 
 * Some pages in the Local Management Interface (LMI) may not function properly if you are using Firefox 2.0.0.17. 
 * For the hardware appliance: The filter service will restart itself every 10 minutes on the appliance's hardware if you are using a ruleset with only tagging enabled. Contact IBM ISS Technical Support for a patch if you are experiencing this issue. 
 * In SiteProtector, antivirus events generated by the appliance will display the actual virus name as the class of the event.
