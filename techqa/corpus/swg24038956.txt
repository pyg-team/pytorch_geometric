Version 6.2.3 FP03 : 

Provisional Fix 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0003-IV65616 is required to repair the product installation media, before installation is attempted, on RHEL 7 platforms. This fix is always required before installation on RHEL 7 platforms can be successful. 

This patch should be applied to the following entities of your IBM Tivoli Monitoring environment.  * IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 03 Agents installation media 
 * Other product installation media containing the ITM Common Installer component versions 06.22.00.00 - 06.23.04.00 which has been certified for installation on RHEL 7 platforms.


This patch can be applied directly to the installation media, or it can be applied to the installation media after it has been added to a Monitoring Server depot. 

After applying the fix directly to the installation media, you can use the updated media image for any of the following purposes: 
- Run install.sh from the updated media. 
- Run tacmd exportbundles with -i pointing to the updated media. 
- Run tacmd addbundles with -i pointing to the updated media. 
- Transport the new tar file generated from the updated media and 
transport it to another system, expand it and run install.sh. 

If you intend to use "tacmd exportbundles" with the "-os LINUX" option, after applying this provisional, you must also apply the provisional 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0003-IV65616.1 before you run "tacmd exportbundles". Failure to do this will result in the generation of a silentInstall.sh in the exported bundle directory which will not execute successfully on RHEL 7 platforms. 

After applying the fix to the installation media already loaded into a monitoring server depot, you can use the updated image in the depot age for any of the following purposes: 
- Run tacmd createnode. 
- Run tacmd updateagent. 
- Run tacmd addsystem. 
- Run tacmd exportbundles using the "-p" option without the "-i" option. 




Provisional Fix 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0003-IV65616.1 is required only when you will be using "tacmd exportbundles" with the "-os LINUX" option to generate exported bundles. If you will not be using the "-os LINUX" option or even the "tacmd exportbundles" command, then this patch is not required. 

This patch should be applied to the following entities of your IBM Tivoli Monitoring environment.  * IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 03 Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions component installed at IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 03 monitoring servers.


If you intend to use "tacmd exportbundles" with the "-os LINUX" option after applying this provisional to install on RHEL 7 platforms, you must also apply the provisional 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0003-IV65616 to repair the installation media which will be referenced with the "-i" option before you run "tacmd exportbundles". Failure to do this will result in the generation of an exported bundle directory which will not install successfully on RHEL 7 platforms. 

This patch can be installed locally or through remote deploy. 

After the Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions component has been updated, "tacmd exportbundles" with the "-os LINUX" option will generate a silentInstall.sh script which will execute correctly on RHEL 7 platforms. 


Version 6.2.3 FP05: 

Provisional Fix 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0005-IV65616 is required to repair the product installation media, before installation is attempted, on RHEL 7 platforms. This fix is always required before installation on RHEL 7 platforms can be successful. 

This patch should be applied to the following entities of your IBM Tivoli Monitoring environment.  * IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 05 Agents installation media 
 * Other product installation media containing the ITM Common Installer component version 06.23.05.00 which has been certified for installation on RHEL 7 platforms.


This patch can be applied directly to the installation media, or it can be applied to the installation media after it has been added to a Monitoring Server depot. 

After applying the fix directly to the installation media, you can use the updated media image for any of the following purposes: 
- Run install.sh from the updated media. 
- Run tacmd exportbundles with -i pointing to the updated media. 
- Run tacmd addbundles with -i pointing to the updated media. 
- Transport the new tar file generated from the updated media and 
transport it to another system, expand it and run install.sh. 

If you intend to use "tacmd exportbundles" with the "-os LINUX" option, after applying this provisional, you must also apply the provisional 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0005-IV65616.1 before you run "tacmd exportbundles".

This patch should be applied to the following entities of your IBM Tivoli Monitoring environment.  * IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 05 Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions component installed at IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring, Version 6.2.3: Fix Pack 05 monitoring servers.
