APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I'm using IBM SPSS Statistics v23 and recently upgraded my
   operating system to Windows 10.  I use extension bundles and
   just tried to upgrade my existing installed bundles by selecting
   Utilities->Extension Bundles->Download and Install Extension
   Bundles.  I selected a bundle that showed a more recent "Latest
   Version", took the default to "Download and install selected
   extension bundles", and clicked OK.  I then received the
   following error:
   
   SPSSINC RAKE:Cannot install extension bundle to any of the
   specified locations:Please see
   Help.[C:\ProgramData\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23\extensions,
   C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23\extensions,
   C:\PROGRA~1\IBM\SPSS\STATIS~1\23\extensions]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This is an issue resulting from more restrictive permissions
   being required by Windows 10 to modify the folder where
   extension bundles are stored. Applying the next IBM SPSS
   Statistics 23 Fix Pack will upgrade all the pre-installed
   extensions to the latest releases, and you should be able to
   continue installing new extensions from the catalog, just not
   able to upgrade any you've already installed. We are working on
   a more robust solution and expect to provide it in a future
   release.
   
   A workaround is to create the following System Environment
   variables and folders prior to installing SPSS Statistics
   Client:
   SPSS_CDIALOGS_PATH=C:\dlg
   SPSS_EXTENSIONS_PATH=n:\extcommon;c:\extcommon
   
   * Where C:\dlg, N:\extcommon;C:\extcommon are existing folders
   on your local file system.
   * Use of separate paths can minimize permissions problems.
   
   If you've already installed Statistics and are now failing to
   update with 23.0-FP2 (or from the Utilities menu), it is
   possible to:
   1) Create the alternative paths
   2) Create the System Environment Variables
   3) Run the extension bundle installer from Utilities  or run the
   Statistics 23.0 FP2 installer to install, recreate, update your
   extensions.
   
   
   An alternate workaround involves the editing of your Windows
   Registry by completely disabling the UAC feature of Windows.
   This involves locating and editing the value of the 'EnableLUA'
   registry key. Please search online for articles on how this can
   be achieved.
   
   ** Disclaimer **
   Manually editing Registry Keys is done at the end-user's own
   risk. Ensure you have a backup and restoration plan regarding
   your Registry on the unlikely event of an error occurring when
   making this change.
