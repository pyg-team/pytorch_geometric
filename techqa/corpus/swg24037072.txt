ERROR DESCRIPTION: 
WebServer Plug-in custom property "UseInsecure" does not affect plugin-cfg.xml generation in V7. 

LOCAL FIX: 

PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
IBM WebSphere Application Server web
server plugin users

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Users running WebSphere plugin v8.5 may want allow secure connection failures to use nonsecure connections.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

When using WebSphere Plugin V8.5 or higher, if a secure request arrives and a secure transport is defined, the connection will fail if a secure connection can not be made to the application server. This behavior can be changed by setting the "useInsecure" custom property as described in PM85452. This custom property was previously only settable when generating the plugin configuration in WebSphere v8.5 or higher but with this apar, the customer property can be set and picked up when generating the configuration in WebSphere Application Server v7 or v8.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 
This custom property was previously only settable when generating the plugin configuration in WebSphere Application Server V8.5 or higher but with this apar, the custom property can be set and picked up when generating the configuration in WebSphere Application Server V7 or V8. 




NOTE-This custom property is only recognized (and only needed) in web server plugin v8.5 and higher. 

Set the custom property UseInsecure=true on the Servers > Web Servers > Web_server_name > Plug-in properties > Custom properties page. 

The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix packs 7.0.0.33 and 8.0.0.9. Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for delivery information: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]
