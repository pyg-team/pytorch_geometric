ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Liberty Fixpack Update And Associated CICS Support.
   PM80214 updates the Liberty Profile technology shipped with CICS
   TS 5.1 to WebSphere Liberty Profile v8.5.0 Fixpack 1. It fixes a
   number of minor configuration issues when running in a CICS JVM
   server, but most importantly it introduces support for OSGi
   applications deployed as EBAs (Enterprise bundle archives) to
   Liberty.
   Liberty Fixpack 1 introduced a restriction that prevents direct
   access to exported packages of OSGi bundles from Servlets within
   a WAR application. This CICS APAR provides an alternative
   mechanism to achieve that design pattern (Servlets to access
   OSGi bundle code). The support is provided by leveraging the
   more functionally rich "OSGi Application" provided by the
   WebSphere Development Tooling for the Liberty Profile. An OSGi
   Application is deployed as an Enterprise Bundle Archive (EBA)
   file to Liberty, and CICS Explorer SDK will be extended to
   deploy this application type to the Liberty Server instance
   running under a JVM server in CICS.
   Within an OSGi application you can develop both Servlets (as WAB
   files) and OSGi bundles (as Plug-in projects). Servlets in the
   WAB file may access OSGi services provided by the OSGi bundles
   within the same EBA. EBAs provide a level of isolation (and run
   in a Blueprint container) within the Liberty Server runtime.
   Application developers should consider the use of Blueprint and
   EBA as a way to deploy their applications once this APAR has
   been installed

COMMENTS
 *  CICS TS 5.1 has been updated to use a Liberty JVM server
   that is based on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile
   Version 8.5.0 Fix Pack 1.
   In addition, the following WebSphere Application Server Liberty
   profile APAR fixes have been incorporated into the CICS Liberty
   JVM Server:
   PM83572 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM83572], PM83576 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM83576], PM83586 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM83586], PM83666 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM83666], PM84523 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM84523], PM85097 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM85097], PM86895 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM86895].
   
   This fix removes visibility between applications deployed
   to the Liberty profile server and OSGi bundles installed into
   the OSGi framework of JVM server via CICS Bundle resources
   and middleware bundles listed in the OSGI_BUNDLES variable of
   the JVM profile, with the exception of DB2 JDBC driver jars.
   To overcome this restriction, CICS now supports OSGi Application
   Projects which are deployed as an Enterprise Bundle Archive
   (EBA) via a CICS bundle resource.
   
   The CICS Explorer version 5.1.1 is required to deploy an EBA
   in a CICS bundle resource.  The existing example applications
   have been converted to EBA and the example RDO group DFH$WLP
   has been updated to include bundle resource definitions for
   deploying the examples.
   The CICS Liberty profile features: cics-ts and
   cics-ts-security have been changed to cicsts-1.0
   and cicstsSecurity-1.0 to be in line with other Liberty
   profile features. If the Java property
   -Dcom.ibm.cics.jvmserver.wlp.autoconfig=true is set
   in the JVM profile, CICS will update the Liberty profile
   configuration with the new feature names.
   If the property is not set, the Liberty profile server.xml
   will need to be updated manually.  The CICS feature no
   longer imports the jsp-2.2 feature.
   
   A new Liberty profile feature cicstsJdbc-1.0 is available
   when using DriverManager to get a connection to a DB2
   database with JDBC.  The feature aids visibility between
   web applications and DB2 JDBC drivers.  The Java property
   -Dcom.ibm.cics.jvmserver.wlp.jdbc.driver.location specifies
   the location of the DB2 driver. If the Java property
   -Dcom.ibm.cics.jvmserver.wlp.autoconfig=true is set in
   the JVM profile and either
   -Dcom.ibm.cics.jvmserver.wlp.jdbc.driver.location is set, or
   the OSGI_BUNDLES variable contains the location of DB2 drivers,
   CICS will update the Liberty profile configuration with the JDBC
   feature. If the autoconfigure property is not set, the Liberty
   profile server.xml will need to be updated manually.
   
   The CICS TS 5.1 Infocenter has been updated with the
   changes introduced by this APAR.
