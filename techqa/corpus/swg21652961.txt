ABSTRACT
 A new version of the Netcool/OMNIbus Probe Extension Package will be available to download from December 14, 2017. 

CONTENT
 

The Probe Extension Package is a separate package that provides extra rules files that a probe will use when processing data. Each time an updated version of the Probe Extension Package is released you can update the rules file that your existing probes use when processing data.

This allows you to update to the latest rules files without having to upgrade the probe currently running on your target device.

This version of the Probe Extension Package provides probe rules files to support the following:

 * Lookup file updates for Adva FSP-NM Version 9.5 and 9.6
 * Event enrichment for Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Version 13.0 and 14.0
