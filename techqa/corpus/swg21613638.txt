CAUSE
The message "a user-mapped section open" typically means a running process is using that file and the installer is unable to proceed. On Windows, this is most commonly caused by an Anti-virus 

program or Desktop search software.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the wpinstalllog.txt and log.txt for the above error messages. The files can be found here: 


<PortalServer root>/log/wpinstalllog.txt
<AppServer root>/logs/install/logt.txt


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Manually uninstall the existing environment. 


2. Shut down any file indexing services you may have running. Be sure to shut down all of them. This includes any antivirus software (such as Norton Antivirus) or desktop search software (like Google Desktop).

3. Re-attempt the installation

4. After the install completes, re-enable whatever Windows services were disabled.
