SUMMARY
 Apache Tomcat and OpenSSL have security vulnerabilities that enables an attacker to exploit the application. Respective security vulnerabilities are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
This section includes the vulnerability details that affect the Rational Build Forge. 

CVE-ID: CVE-2016-8610 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8610]

Description: OpenSSL has a security vulnerability, where processing of ALERT packets that are defined in the TLS/SSL protocol during a connection handshake results in a denial-of-service (DOS) attack.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).


CVE-ID: CVE-2017-6056 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6056]

Description: Apache Tomcat has a security vulnerability, due to which a programming error while processing of HTTPS requests results in a denial-of-service (DOS) attack through an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122312] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).


CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5647 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647]

Description: Apache Tomcat has a security vulnerability, while send file processing of the previous request is complete, the pipelined requests are being lost. This vulnerability results in sending wrong responses to wrong requests that exposes the possibility for an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the responses.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).


CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5648 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5648]

Description: Apache Tomcat has a security vulnerability, where it allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions caused by the failure to use the appropriate facade object by certain application listener calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access and modify data on a system.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124399 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124399] for the current score.
