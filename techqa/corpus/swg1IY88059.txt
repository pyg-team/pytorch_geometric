APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Removing a node from a Websphere cluster that contains FIM
   product, does not cleanup node data pertaining to FIM
   configuration.
   
   Since cleanup is not properly executed, ISC console will still
   show the removed node within "runtime mangement" gui screen.
   
   Development has indicated this issue is a limitation of FIM. The
   limitation is due to the node not being able to remove the stale
   data from the FIM management service.
   
   However, there is a procedure or workaround that can be executed
   to properly cleanup node information. This workaround needs to
   be documented for this limitation
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround is to remove the stale data from FIM:
   
   In order to remove the nodes, the customer needs to go into the
   directory $WAS_HOME/config/itfim/<domain name>/nodes/.../ and
   delete the directories corresponding to the servers that have
   been removed from the cluster.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   Stale node data still exists in ISC after node
   removal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   The fix for this APAR is expected to be cont
   ained in the following maintenance delivery vehicle:
