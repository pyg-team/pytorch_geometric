QUESTION
 Using ITCAMfTx with a Rational Performance Tester (RPT) test script that involves custom code included in .jar files, how to make such script to be played back successfully on a Robotic Response Time agent? 

CAUSE
By default, the .jar files are not 'visible' or found by the jvm running the RPT script on the T6 RRT agent

ANSWER
The following steps are needed to be done or verified : 

1) When the RPT script has been uploaded to the ITCAMfTx AMC T3 agent, and then deployed on the ITCAMfTx RRT T6 agent, the custom jar files included in the source of the script package are normally deployed under 
<ITM HOME>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\scripts\<script name> directory 
automatically 

2) To have the ITCAM RRT T6 agent to pick up the needed jars as part of the JVM, follow the technote 1381106 - Error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibm.util.VariablePersister
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21381106 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21381106] 

For example, if your RPT script is using the following two jar files that include your custom codes : 
- "cleanARM.jar" and "customSecurityDefinition.jar" 

manually copy the cleanARM.jar and customSecurityDefinition.jar 
from <ITM HOME>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\scripts\<script name> 
to 
<ITM HOME>\app\RPT\lib 

Note that since/if this above lib folder doesn't exist yet, you can simply create it. 

3) Stop the ITCAM4tx Robotic agent (t6). 

edit the managed_jvm.xml file located 
in <ITM HOME>\TMAITM6\app\RPT\config

add the needed two jars there as part of the classpath, with the following lines : 
<element path="${MA_DIR}/app/rpt/lib/cleanARM.jar" /> 
<element path="${MA_DIR}/app/rpt/lib/SecurityDefinition.jar" /> 

4) Restart the ITCAM agent.

5) Using the AMC Editor from the TEP console, create a robotic response time profile to playback your script.
