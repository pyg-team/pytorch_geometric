ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Open ReqPro Project from Within RSA takes too long.
   Note: This APAR is about open ReqPro project Only. The Linking P
   erformance issues are handled in a different APAR
   
   PMR INFO:
   
   Description of problem:
   
   The customer is having performance delay when opening Requisite
   Pro Project within RSA Requirements Perspective takes more than
   20 minutes.
   
   When opening a Requisite Pro Project from Networkdrive, in some
   cases the opening of the Project fails with a error message sayi
   ng 'a error occurred' in some cases it takes up to 30 Minutes to
    open it. The project has  dependencies to dB2.
   
   This seems to happen to one particular project.
   
   After doing some db2 tuning, the time to open the requisitePro p
   roject seems to have improved
   
   Our DB2 performance tuning efforts improved the situation signif
   icantly.

   Steps to reproduce (if there are none, description of what you'v
   e already tried):
   -? not relevant since we did not reproduce
   
   Does the customer have a workaround?
   -? no
   
   What is the customer expecting as the result?
   -? The customer wants to know;
   1. how he can improve even improve  more the connection performa
   nces.
   2. what are the recommendations we can give them on how to manag
   e their database db2 and their RequisitePro
   3. how to improve connection time when on opening remotely.
   -? in ReqPro the requirements are loaded 'on demand'. Can simila
   r behavior be setup for the opening of the project in RSA?
   RSA seems to fetch the entire DB at opening time.
   4.Best practice on using RequisitePro project and RSA
   -? How should they structure their project to have reasonable pe
   rformance at opening time and when linking requirements
   to UML elements.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Performance issue opening project.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in release RSx 754.
   
   Changed the logic of the Open RequisitePro project to fetch
   all data at once instead of package by package
