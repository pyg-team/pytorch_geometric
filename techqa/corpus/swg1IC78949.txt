APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SSL handshake failures on incoming connections to SSL enabled
   front side handlers can cause unpredictable failures in other
   transactions on the appliance.  The unpredictable failures could
   include (but are not limited to):
   
   premature TCP connection closure
   RSA sign failure
   RSA verify failure
   RSA encrypt failure
   RSA decrypt failure
   certificate validation failure
   SSL handshake failure
   WTX operation failure
   crypto engine runtime errors with log messages ending in "e: 9"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are users of SSL-enabled HTTPS, IMS Connect, Stateless
   Raw XML, and Stateful Raw XML handlers.
   
   In firmware versions 4.0.1.0 through 4.0.1.3 and version
   4.0.2.0, customers using services with certain SSL-enabled
   handlers might see unpredictable failures in other transactions
   on the appliance.
   
   The unpredictable failures are triggered by certain SSL
   handshake failures to these handlers where a resource is
   released incorrectly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 4.0.1.4 and 4.0.2.1.
