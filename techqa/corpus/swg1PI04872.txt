Fixes integrated in WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.1 Combined Cumulative Fixes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034497]



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WCM uses a default transaction timeout of 120 seconds even when
   the value is changed in the server.  Need a fix to configure
   the default transaction timeout value used by WCM.
   
   The transaction timeout can be experienced, for example, when
   deleting a virtual portal via the UI:
   
   TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction
   PA_MageVirtualPortals#MgeVirtualPortals
   .war#ManageVirtualPortals
   <transaction ID#> has timed out after 120 seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To avoid the timeout in the virtual portal case, utilize the
   ConfigEngine task to delete the virtual portal instead of the
   UI.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WCM uses a default transaction timeout of 120 seconds even when
   the value is changed in the server.  Need a fix to configure
   the default transaction timeout value used by WCM.
   The transaction timeout can be experienced, for example, when
   deleting a virtual portal via the UI:
   TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction
   PA_MageVirtualPortals#MgeVirtualPortals
   .war#ManageVirtualPortals
   &lt;transaction ID#&gt; has timed out after 120 seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 09 (PM98649 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM98649]) for Portal
   8.0.0.1 available from Fix Central:

   Note: In order to leverage the code fix, you must add (or
   update if already exists) the following custom property to the
   WCM_WCMConfigService Resource Environment Provider:
   Name: wcm.transaction.timeout
   Value: 600 (for example)
   Restart server to take effect.
