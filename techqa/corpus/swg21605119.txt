Title: IBM Suppress the documentation text in the generated IRL of business rules - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In a ruleset, the documentation text for each business rule is normally included as a comment before the generated IRL. How to suppress such comments in the ruleset ?
Why is the documentation text of a decision table repeated for every rule (one per row) in the generated IRL ? 

ANSWER
The documentation of a rule is meant to be part of the extraction process, and it is possible to access its value programmatically at runtime with the API IlrRule.getFormalComment() [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.reference.studio/html/api/html/ilog/rules/engine/IlrRule.html]. Since each row of a decision table is converted to one IRL rule, in order for the documentation text of the decision table to be accessible at runtime with the API IlrRule.getFormalComment(), the comment is repeated in every IRL rule derived from the decision table. 

If the documentation of the rule is not needed at runtime it is possible to suppress it in the generated IRL by implementing a custom IlrIRLCodeGenerator that overrides the method IlrIRLCodeGenerator.printDocumentation(String documentation) [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.reference.studio/html/api/html/ilog/rules/brl/translation/codegen/IlrIRLCodeGenerator.html#printDocumentation(java.lang.String)] 

 

A sample Rule Designer plugin nodocirl_1.0.0.jar is provided below along with its source code: 

 nodocirl_1.0.0.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=2]nodocirl_1.0.0.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=1]nodocirl-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=4]nodocirl-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=3] 

Install the Sample in Rule Designer 

To deploy in Rule Designer drop the plugin file nodocirl_1.0.0.jar in the dropins folder of the Eclipse installation in use ( for example C:\IBM\WODM80\WODM\dropins , or C:\IBM\WebSphereILOGJRules7114\eclipse\dropins ). Then restart Rule Designer and do a clean build of the rule projects. 

Install the Sample in Decision Center 

The same custom IlrIRLCodeGenerator code can be used in Decision Center. To deploy it, bundle the file nodocirl_1.0.0.jar in the jrules-teamserver-<APPSERVER>.ear/teamserver.war/WEB-INF/lib directory and add a file jrules-teamserver-<APPSERVER>.ear/teamserver.war/WEB-INF/classes/preferences.properties containing the line: 

webui.codeGenerator.irl = nodocirl.NoDocIRLCodeGenerator 

Then redeploy the Decision Center application. Clean the Decision Center cache to make sure previously built artifacts are rebuilt with the customization in place.
