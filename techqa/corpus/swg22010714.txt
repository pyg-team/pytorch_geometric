QUESTION
 Why is the MyFilegateway users not timing out at the time it is supposed to expire in Sterling Filegateway?

The user was created as a Sterling Filegateway Partner and the timeout value was set to 10 minutes. 

The following was observed: 

*The MyFilegateway Partner logged in.

*They did their activity within the MyFilegateway User Interface(ui). 

*They stayed logged in but idle (not doing any more work on the screen). 

*The UI timed out 1 minute before it was meant to time out. In this case, it timed out 9 minutes after inactivity. The user was configured to time out at 10 minutes. 

ANSWER
This is working as designed. 
Please take a look at the documentation of the Session Timeout for Partner creation, which points out this behavior: 

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4TGX_2.2.0/com.ibm.help.sfg_route_prov.doc/SFGCreatePartner.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4TGX_2.2.0/com.ibm.help.sfg_route_prov.doc/SFGCreatePartner.html]

Snippet: 
Session Timeout (in minutes) Number of minutes of inactivity before session ends. Default is 15. To change the default, System Administrators can edit the customer_overrides.properties file.
Note
The actual timeout value your partner experiences will always be slightly shorter than the value you set. For example, the default value 15 results in an actual session timeout of 14 minutes. If you set the value at 10, the actual session timeout is 9 minutes. This helps prevent data loss by ending the client session before the server times out.
