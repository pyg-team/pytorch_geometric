 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If you have two FileNet P8 environments as shown below:



First Environment

FileNet P8 4.0.1 FP 11

Jboss Application Server

Windows 2003

Oracle 10G



Second Environment

FileNet P8 5.2.0 FP003

WebSphere Application Server

Windows 2008

Oracle 11G



Is it possible to export one object store from CE 4.0.1 to CE 5.2 by using FDM ?


CAUSE
There is no other alternative.

ANSWER
No, you cannot and it's not supported. You must upgrade the Object Store. As for export/import using FEM/FDM, it is meant for exporting/importing from a source system to a target system of the same
release (e.g., Dev => Test environment, UAT => Production environment, etc.)

The following export/import scenarios are supported:

- 3.5.x => 3.5.x - supported with FEM
- 4.0.x => 4.0.x - supported with FEM
- 4.5.0 => 4.5.0 - supported with FEM
- 4.5.1 => 4.5.1 - supported with FDM (FEM as it has been deprecated for export/import in 4.5.1)
- 5.0.0 => 5.0.0 - supported with FDM (FEM as it has been deprecated for export/import in 5.0)
