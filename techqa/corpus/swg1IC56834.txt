APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If for example a channel has a invalid conname and is BINDING
   when the queue manager is ended with preemptive option the qmgr
   indicates it has shutdown but the channel process will remain
   until the IO on TCPIP completes. After a period of time
   depending on how long it takes the process to get the response
   from TCPIP the queue manager will report the process' existence
   preventing strmqm completion.  Workaround is to either wait for
   the process to end, could be up to 5 minutes, or stop the
   process found by strmqm that is preventing it to complete.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After an endmqm -p completed, a strmqm displays:
   AMQ8041: The queue manager cannot be restarted or deleted
   because processes,that were previously connected, are still
   running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The EC failed to stop a MCA process during preemptive shutdown
   for a channel that was in a BINDING status at the time.
   Released in WMQ V53 HP NonStop V5313 fix pack.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Verify if any processes are left running for the queue manager
   on OSS using command:  ps -f | grep <qmgr name>
   Manually kill the process(es) found running.
