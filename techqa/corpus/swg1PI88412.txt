APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The authoring portlet menu buttons are no longer functional
   after accessing the same server under a different hostname via a
   link that is rendered from the initial server instance.
   
   Depending on the button/links being used, exceptions similar to
   the following can be seen in the browser console:
   - TypeError: ibm.wcm.widget.menu is undefined
   - full.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
   'MenuFactory' of undefined
   - dojo/parser::parse() error Error: Unable to resolve
   constructor for: 'ibm.wcm.widget.favorite.FavoriteLocation'
   
   Note: The issue only occurs on Firefox and Chrome.
   
   Example:
   - The server hostname is named both and Test02.
   - Create a link that points to the authoring portlet on Test02.
   - Access the server from Test01 and render the link.
   - Once the link is clicked, the browser will redirect to the
   authoring portlet from Test02
   - And even though Test02 is the same server instance, the
   authoring portlet buttons no longer work after logging into
   Test02
