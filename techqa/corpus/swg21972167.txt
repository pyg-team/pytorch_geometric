Title: IBM Installing a no-charge, unsupported IBM HTTP Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I install a trial (unsupported) version of IBM HTTP Server? 

CAUSE
IBM HTTP Server is available as a no-charge, unsupported download for projects that require an HTTP server for purposes not directly related to IBM products that have bundled IBM HTTP Server. This is referred to as a "trial" download, but it has no functional or temporal limitations.

Trial versions of IBM HTTP Server are not eligible for customer or product support. For best-effort/community support, see the ibmhttpserver tag on http://stackoverflow.com [http://stackoverflow.com/].

ANSWER
Beginning in 9.0.0.6, the simplest way to get started is to use what's called the "IHS Archive Install". The archive based installation includes an integrated copy of the WebSphere WebServer Plug-in, and requires no IBM Installation Manager nor WebSphere Configuration Tool. The historical option, using IBM Installation Manager remains available.



 OPTION 1: INSTALL FROM AN ARCHIVE (NO IBM INSTALLATION MANAGER) 
 1. Search Fix Central for IHS Archive Install installation packages
    Fix Central search: "Archive Install: IBM HTTP Server" [https://www.ibm.com/support/home/search-results?q=%22Archive%20Install:%20IBM%20HTTP%20Server%22] 
    Or...find the latest available Fix Pack in the WebSphere Application Server recommended updates page and follow the link to the fixpack-specific download document (scroll to "IBM HTTP Server Archives") http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004980#ver90 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004980#ver90] 
 2. Download the appropriate package for your operating system and architecture, and simply extract to install. 
 3. Run the "postinstall" script at the root of the archive. 
 4. Full details about working with the archive install are available in the IHS Knowledge Center: 
    https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/tihs_install_config_archive.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/tihs_install_config_archive.html]


 OPTION 2: INSTALL USING IBM INSTALLATION MANAGER 
 1. Download and install IBM Installation Manager, available from the following URL: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27025142#1.8 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27025142#1.8]
    Note: If IBM Installation Manager is already installed on the system where you want to install IBM HTTP Server, skip this step.
    
 2. Launch IBM Installation Manager. 
    
 3. Determine the IBM Installation Manager repositories for IBM HTTP Server.
     * For IBM HTTP Server Version 9.0, specify the following repository URL:
       http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/V9WASSupplements [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/V9WASSupplements]
       (URL is for IBM Installation Manager, not direct browser access) 
     * For IBM HTTP Server Version 8.5.5, specify the following repository URL:
       http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.IHSILAN.v85 [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.IHSILAN.v85]
       (URL is for IBM Installation Manager, not direct browser access)
       
    
    
 4. Add the repository URL via the 'File > Preferences' menu ('Repositories' page) in IBM Installation Manager.
    
 5. Return to the default IBM Installation Manager screen, click Install, find the "IBM HTTP Server for WebSphere Application Server" in the list of Installation Packages, and follow the prompts.



Notes: 

 * The WebSphere Application Server Web Server Plug-in and the Plug-in Configuration Tool are available as part of the same repository as IBM HTTP Server. However, these components are typically used directly as part of an IBM product that has bundled them and should be installed through non-trial/standalone mechanisms. 
 * Trial versions of IBM HTTP Server are not eligible for customer or product support. For best-effort/community support, see the ibmhttpserver tag on http://stackoverflow.com [http://stackoverflow.com/].
