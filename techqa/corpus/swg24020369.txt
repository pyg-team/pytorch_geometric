IBM WebSphere Customization Tools are provided for the following:

Components: 

 * Application Server 
 * Feature Packs


Supported Linux Releases:  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 
 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 and higher


Supported WebSphere Application Server Versions: 
This version of WebSphere Customization Tools can be used to configure WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V7.0. The contained Profile Management Tool can also be used to configure WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V6.1. 


Purpose 
You can install the most current release of WebSphere Customization Tools Version 7.0 on a workstation running a Windows or a Linux Intel operating system so that you can use the Profile Management Tool and the z/OS Migration Management Tool to generate the jobs and instructions for creating and migrating profiles. The WebSphere Customization Tools (WCT) contain the following tools for customizing WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V7.0:  * Profile Management Tool (z/OS only) 
 * z/OS Migration Management Tool


Known issues with WebSphere Customization Tools 7.0.0.29 
 * When creating the customization jobs for a cell definition, if "Use a z/OS security product" on the Administrative Security Selection panel is selected and "Enable Writable SAF Keyring support" is selected on the following panel, the necessary RACF statements for writable SAF keyring support are not generated in the resulting customization jobs. The workaround is to create your cell using the management - deployment manager and application server customization jobs and then federate your application server. 
 * The "Augment" button may not work for customization locations that contain Japanese characters in the path name. The work around is to create customization locations with path names that do not contain Japanese characters. 
 * For some Linux configurations, the "Customization Instructions" and "Migration Instructions" views may not display the instructions for the selected definition. These instructions are displayed with an internal SWT Browser. 
   
   For details on the Linux configuration requirements for the Eclipse internal browser, refer to these URLs:  * What do I need to run the SWT Browser inside Eclipse on Linux/GTK or Linux/Motif? [http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserlinux]
      
      
    * What do I need to run the SWT Browser in a stand-alone application on Linux GTK or Linux Motif? [http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserlinuxrcp]
   
   
   Alternatively, you can use the PMT's associated "Customization Summary" or "Migration Summary" view (by default, the tabs for these views are right next to the tabs for the associated "Customization Instructions" and "Migration Instructions" views) to get the path name of the instruction file. Then manually display the instruction file in an external browser of your choice.
