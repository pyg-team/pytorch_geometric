 *  The following accessibility issues exist in Process Portal
   (note that these issues were found using Version 14 of
   JAWS (R) screen reading software from Freedom Scientific):
   
   1. If the user logs in with an incorrect ID/password, the
   "Login failed" message is not spoken.  Subsequently when the
   cursor is in the User ID field, it is not spoken.
   
   2. On the Work page, under the Following tab, the text "You
   are not following any processes" (when displayed) is not spoken.
   
   3. After clicking on a process being followed, displaying the
   Details page (with Stream on the right side of the page), the
   user experiences the following issues:
   
   a. The drop-down button at the top next to the task name
   and Follow icon/button is not spoken.
   b. The due date is spoken, but with the wrong time of day.
   c. The created and completed dates are not spoken.
   d. The Stream label is not spoken (instead, "Main region
   work post edit type of text" is spoken.
   
   4. On the Work page, under the @Mentions tab, the text "Your
   name does not appear in any posts" (when displayed) is not
   spoken.
   
   5. On the Unfollow dialog, the text "Are you sure you want to
   stop following this process?" is not spoken; additionally
   pressing Insert+Z may be needed to have the text "Don't show me
   this message again" spoken.
   
   6. With a Coach form open, in the header, the "Task: Submit
   requisition drop-down" speaks "Unlabeled 7 button".
   
   7. In Work > My Tasks, the "Expand all task rows" button text
   is not spoken (although hover text is displayed).
   
   8. On the Claim task dialog, the text "This task is still
   unclaimed. When you open this task, it will be assigned to you"
   is not spoken.
