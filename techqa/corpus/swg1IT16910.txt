APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When constructing a decision service a .RULES file is created
   that contains:
   - Parameter signatures (name, type, direction)
   - Rules text
   
   When a .RULES file is deployed, the values are read from the
   file and used to create an IBM Operational Decision Manager
   (ODM) Ruleset that the DecisionService node uses.
   
   Incorrect behavior may be seen such as parameters not being
   matched to their name or type etc because the tag values within
   the .RULES file can be truncated.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus v9.0 and v10.0 deploying a
   decision service .RULES file to create an IBM Operational
   Decision Manager (ODM) Ruleset to be used by a DecisionService
   node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a .RULES file is deployed, the values are read from the
   file and used to create an IBM Operational Decision Manager
   (ODM) Ruleset that the DecisionService node uses.
   
   As part of this process the .RULES file is parsed as an XML file
   and a defect existed such that the tag values within this .RULES
   file could be right truncated. This can cause incorrect behavior
   such as parameters not being matched to their name or type.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been corrected and the tag values in the .RULES
   file are no longer truncated when parsed.
