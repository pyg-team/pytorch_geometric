Title: IBM Deployment Engine upgrade failure "ACUDCI0711E" - United States

Text:
DEL2; TIPL2; Deployment Engine; ACUDCI0711E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Maintenance updates fail during the Deployment Engine pre-checks with the error:

"ACUDCI0711E Dependency Checker determined that the following IUInstance: <>, cannot be created because another version of that instance already exists in the IURegistry.." 

CAUSE
Cause is unknown. Somehow the DE installation has become corrupted, possibly due to previous failed installation attempts.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the product installation log in the install user's home directory. Check for errors similar to:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform a de_backupdb: 
From a command prompt execute:
<DE HOME>\bin>de_backupdb

You should get a confirmation "Request completed successfully." Verify you see a backup file with the current date in the following directory:

<DE HOME>\backupDBs. 






 1. Copy the most recent backup file to a safe location outside of <DE HOME>
    
 2. Remove the existing DE: 
    From the command prompt execute:
    <DE HOME>\bin>si_inst.bat -r -f 
    
    You should see something like:
    
    ACUINI0077W The backupDBs directory was not removed. Please remove it 
    manually. 
    ACUINI0027W Deployment Engine Uninstallation could not remove all files and directories.
    
    *****Do not remove the acsi folder where the backupDBs directory is located***** 
    
 3. Run the installation program for the base version of the product in question. Only run the installer until the Pre-Installation summary is displayed. At that point the DE component has been reinstalled and you should quit the base product installer.
    
    Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in the following technical note to reinstall DE:
    Manually installing the Deployment Engine component [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621801]
    
 4. Perform a de_restoredb: 
    From a command prompt execute:
    
    <DE HOME>\bin>restoredb.cmd 
    
    ACUDB0005I The restoredb command completed successfully. 
    
    This should restore the backup that was taken in step 1. 
    
 5. Retry the product maintenance/fix pack installation.
