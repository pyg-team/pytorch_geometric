QUESTION
 What happens when you close or deactivate a matter in the Atlas application? 

ANSWER
Please note that if a matter is closed or deactivated, the custodians who were part of a hold will not automatically be sent a release notice. The system will consider the custodians released from the hold regardless of whether the release notice was sent. Therefore, when closing or deactivating a matter the paralegals and or attorneys should make sure all the necessary procedures are followed before taking action.
Closing a Matter

The following is a description of what happens to a matter and the underlying requests, holds, collections and interviews when the matter is closed.


 * All the requests with the "In Progress" status will be marked as "Completed". This means that these requests can no longer be used for creating notices. 
 * Hold notices and self-collection notices in either the "Drafted" or "Published" status will remain in the same state, but the option to publish them will no longer be there. 
 * Hold notices and self-collection notices with the "Sent" status will now be set to "Suspended". These notices can still be sent out after closing the matter if you choose "Resume Email Transmission" option. The responses from the recipients will be recorded even if the matter is closed. 
 * Self-collection and interview plans will be marked as "Completed". 
 * Published preservation plans will be set to "Release" status; drafted plans will be set to "Inactive". 
 * Published collection plans will be set to "Complete" status; drafted plans will be set to "Inactive". 
 * Closed matters will no longer be displayed under the default matter list screen. In order to access closed matters, you can use advanced search screen or change the search options for the matter list screen. 

NOTE: Once the matter is closed, you will not be able to send out any new notices. As a best practice, we recommend that you issue the release notices prior to closing a matter. 


Deactivate a Matter 

The following is a description of what happens to a matter and the underlying requests, holds, collections and interviews when the matter is deactivated. Deactivating a matter essentially means that you are "deleting" it. 
 * All of the requests with the "In Progress" status will be marked as "Inactive". This means that these requests can no longer be used for creating notices. 
 * Hold notices and self-collection notices in "Drafted" status, will be set to "Inactive". 
 * Hold notices and self-collection notices with the "Sent" status will remain the same. Even though the notice status doesn't change, reminders will not be sent out as the matter will no longer be active. 
 * Self-collection and interview plans with the "In Progress" status will be marked as "Inactive". Plans with the "Completed" status will remain the same. 
 * Published preservation plans will be set to "Release" status; drafted plans will be set to "Inactive". 
 * Published Collection Plans will be set to "Complete" status; drafted plans will be set to "Inactive". 
 * Inactive matters will longer be displayed on the matter list screen. If order to access inactive matters, you can use advanced search screen or change the search options for the matter list screen.


NOTE: Once a matter has been deactivated, the only way to activate the matter is send an update through the matter management feed with an active status . RELATED INFORMATION
