APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The message '+CSQX541E ! CSQXRESP Invalid CCSIDs for data
   conversion, 932 and 5026' was issued when the client channel
   tries to start.
   However, the conversion for these CCSIDs (932 and 5026) is
   supported.
   CSQSNAP showed error occurred in rriConvertValidate because
   'Data conversion failed' for handling 'USERID_DATA' field.
   Customer used DBCS in their OS userid which used in the USERID
   of this client channel.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use SBCS in the UERID field.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 9       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A client application using a userid     *
   *                      which contains DBCS characters after    *
   *                      conversion to the Queue Managers CCSID  *
   *                      fails to connect to the Queue Manager,  *
   *                      with message CSQX541E in the CHINIT.    *
   ****************************************************************
   Conversion of the UserIdentifier field during the connection
   fails when the field contains DBCS characters after conversion
   to the QMGR CCSID. This causes the output of the conversion to
   return a value too large for the field buffer, regardless of the
   contents. This results in the connection to the channel failing
   and message CSQX541E is produced.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The conversion of this field has been altered to allow values
   containing DBCS characters to be used, as long as the value can
   still fit in the field, preventing the CSQX541E message.
