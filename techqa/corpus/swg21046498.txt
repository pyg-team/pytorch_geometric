QUESTION
 While your situation and upgrade proposal might be unique, what are the general advantages and costs when upgrading CICS Transaction Server for z/OS? And, what is required when upgrading to the latest releases of CICS TS from earlier releases? 

ANSWER


 * Advantages to upgrading
 * Costs and things to consider when upgrading
 * Requirements when upgrading






Advantages to upgrading


Typical CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) features being improved and made available with each release:


 * Improved capacity, performance, constraint relief, hardware exploitation, and better documentation
   
 * Consumability and productivity improvements, such as an easier installation process, new off-line tools, and runtime improvements
   
 * Removal of dependencies, such as those capabilities that were previously delivered in CICS TS SupportPacs and CICS TS Feature Packs being moved into CICS TS base code.
   
 * Better support for open standards, in particular relating to TCP/IP and web services
   
 * Being ready when projects need new features, rather than waiting for projects to need new features and risk delaying those features while implementing an upgrade


In particular, for release CICS TS V5.4: 

CICS TS V5.4 delivers unparalleled mixed language application serving. It adds support for a number of programming concepts that are critical to a mixed language application hosting environment, and includes: 
 * Support for applications written to the Java EE 7 Full platform specification.
   
 * A powerful and new asynchronous API to extend programming language capabilities.
   
 * Dynamic policy-based management of applications that span multiple languages.
   
 * Enhanced security and resiliency of applications across all languages.
   
 * API extensions that enable improved interoperability with batch applications.
   
 * Enhanced management capabilities for applications that utilize IBM MQ for z/OS.
   
 * Numerous enhancements to simplify or automate common workflows.



Comprehensive IBM product integration testing: 
 * Latest maintenance is included; this includes post-general availability enhancements that are all tested together for compatibility
   
 * CICS TS is tested with all minimum-releases of co-requisite products, such as the z/OS operating system and other IBM co-requisite products
   
 * Support for Enterprise compilers, such as IBM MQ, IBM DB2, and IBM IMS

Costs and things to consider when upgrading


 * The cost of upgrading the level of operating system, to support the new release of CICS TS.
   
 * The cost and risk of implementing prerequisite upgrade and maintenance of other tools and packages.
   
 * The cost and risk associated with upgrading CICS TS, especially in the planning and execution of that update.
   
 * The removal or announcement of stabilization of CICS TS features that may necessitate an upgrade or changes to newer solutions.
   
 * Some new features require new configurations, or changes to existing configurations, applications, and even development processes within your organization.
   
 * Avoiding any disruption to systems and applications while executing an upgrade. This can necessitate a planned phasing or rolling upgrade to be implemented.
   
 * Did you know? The cost of monthly license charge (MLC) between CICS TS releases is the same. This means that it costs the same for a later release of CICS TS as it does for an earlier release of CICS TS, making cost an incentive to move up to the latest releases of CICS TS.
   
 * The cost of staff education and re-education.

Requirements when upgrading 
IBM provides guidance on Upgrading [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.4.0/upgrading/intro.html] from previous releases of CICS TS in the product documentation, in the IBM Knowledge Center [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/]. In topic Changes between releases [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.4.0/upgrading/changes/version_intro.html], details are provided on the impact of changes to CICS TS between versions or releases of the product. 


The upgrading information for unsupported releases of CICS TS, such as CICS TS V2.3 and CICS TS V3, can be found under CICS Transaction Server 4.1.0 > Upgrading [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_4.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.migration.doc/migrating.html?lang=en] in the IBM Knowledge Center. Note that discontinuance of service for CICS TS V4.1 and CICS TS V4.2 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS915-025] [https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS915-025]has been announced becoming effective towards the end of 2017 and 2018 respectively. Details for upgrading from CICS TS V4 to a later release of CICS TS are available under CICS Transaction Server 5.1.0 > Upgrading [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.migration.doc/topics/migrating.html] in the IBM Knowledge Center. 

When upgrading CICS TS you should always review cross product dependencies in the CICS Preventative Service Planning (PSP) Buckets [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21231874] and the Detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006382] for the release of CICS TS that you are installing. 

IBM also recommends that you review Upgrading information for CICS when changing releases of CICS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21207399], which provides information on problems you might encounter when upgrading CICS and also what to do to prevent the problems from occurring during upgrading.
