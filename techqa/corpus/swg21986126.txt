ABSTRACT
 Cascading ruleset execution enables a ruleset to be executed from rules of another ruleset in a different instance of an execution unit (XU). You can use it in IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) V8.8.0 and V8.8.1. 

CONTENT
Cascading ruleset execution can be useful for routing rules. For example, an insurance company might need to execute a different ruleset for each client category. In this case, the company can call a ruleset to determine the client category, and then execute corresponding ruleset: 

 * The execution of the first ruleset (master ruleset) and the second ruleset (child ruleset) are handled by different XUs. 
 * The caller application executes the master ruleset by using the master XU. The rules of the master ruleset invoke a XOM method that creates the child XU. The child XU then executes the rules of the child rulesets.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986126&amp;aid=1] Cascading ruleset execution is supported in ODM and ODM for z/OS. The master and the child XUs must be in J2SE mode.
