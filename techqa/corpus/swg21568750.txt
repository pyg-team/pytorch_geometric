Title: IBM InfoSphere Information Server installation error on the Services tier "java.lang.NullPointerException" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing Information Server on the Services tier with the option 'use an existing WebSphere application server' the installation issues an error "An Unexpected error occured: java.lang.NullPointerException." when selecting the deployment manager profile. 

CAUSE
WebSphere application server network deployment contains an unmanaged node in the cell with missing directories. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
On the Services tier where WebSphere application server is installed change the current directory to config/cells/<cell_name>/nodes/ from the root of the deployment manager profile. The deployment manager profile by default resides under /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/dmgr01. Validate the directories for each node and the unmanaged node should not have a directory named “servers” 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Cell is a grouping of related nodes and their node agents and a deployment manager from which all administrative tasks for the nodes are installed. A node is a logical grouping of WebSphere Application Server managed server processes.




The InfoSphere Information Server installer expects each node under the Network Deployment cell to be a managed node that contains a directory called "servers" with at least one subdirectory, for example, server1. Remove the unmanaged node from the cell that does not contain the "servers" directory using the WebSphere admin console. An unmanaged node does not have a node agent to manage its servers. Unmanaged nodes in the Network Deployment environment can have server definitions such as Web servers, but not Application Server definitions.

Note: It is a best practice to install InfoSphere Information Server on a single-node cluster and then, after the installation, expand the cluster by adding new managed nodes and cluster members.
