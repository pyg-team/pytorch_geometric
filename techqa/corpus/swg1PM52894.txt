   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enable backward migration to version    *
   *                      7.0.1 after a queue manager has been    *

   *                      queue managers to coexist in a queue    *

   ****************************************************************
   PTFs for the backward migration APAR must be applied on version
   7.0.1 prior to attempting fallback from WebSphere MQ for z/OS
   version 7.1.0.
   
   Attempting to restart a queue manager, which has been run with
   version 7.1.0 libraries, at version 7.0.1 without this PTF will
   result in abnormal termination of the queue manager with reason
   code 00C90D01.
   
   When reverting to Version 7.0.1 after running a queue manager at
   version 7.1.0 the following should be considered.
   
   - It will NOT be possible to backwards migrate to V701 from V710
     if the new functions available in V710 have been activated by
     the OPMODE parameter. Refer to the WebSphere MQ Version 7.1
     infocenter section b
     manager to version 7.0.1b
   
   - If V710 has been started with OPMODE=NEWFUNC then any attempt
     to restart the queue manager at V701 will result in abnormal
     termination of the queue manager with reason code 00C90D01.
   
   - CHLAUTH objects are stored on the SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE.
     They will not be visible at V701 but will reappear when the
     queue manager is subsequently restarted at V710
   
   - New object attributes introduced in V710 will not be present
     in V701, and when you subsequently migrate to V710 they will
     be reset to default values.
   
   - If the queue manager is a cluster repository queue manager,
     then after backward migration, any other V710 queue managers
     in the cluster will not receive information about new V710
     attributes on clustered queues, topics and queue managers from
     this full repository.
   
   - If you are using the MQ Explorer to administer your queue
     manager then after migration between releases the following
     Explorer actions must be performed:
     o Remove the migrated z/OS queue manager
     o Add Remote Queue Manager
   
   This APAR also provides coexistence aspects when migrating queue
   sharing groups to V710.
   
   The coexistence aspects of this APAR allow a V701 queue manager
   in a queue sharing group to handle DISPLAY command responses
   from a V710 queue manager that contain new attributes that exist
   only in V710.
   .
   Following the application of the PTF for this APAR, the queue
   manager must be restarted if coexistence with any V710 queue
   managers in the same QSG is required.
