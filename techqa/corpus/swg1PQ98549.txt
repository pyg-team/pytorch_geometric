APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABENDS such as S0C1, S0C4, S01F, etc. can occur when running
   HAA@BULD job performing the DISASTER RECOVERY function.  There
   are many symptoms of the problem, including S0C4 abends in
   module FEC$BOOT.
   This is a result of more than one Task invoking FEC$BOOT at the
   same time. This has been corrected by ensuring MVS loads a
   separate copy of FEC$BOOT each time it's LOADed.
