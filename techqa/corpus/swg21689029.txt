Title: IBM Rulerunner hangs exporting to IBM P8 Content Engine with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When processing an export to P8 Content Engine using IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture, the Rulerunner thread hangs on the FNP8_Upload action. 

CAUSE
If the uploaded file name is identical to an existing name, Content Engine needs to search for the next available name. If every batch sends identical image names (e.g. TM000001.tif), Content Engine will eventually take so long to locate a name that no response is returned. Since the Rulerunner thread never receives an acknowledgement or an error, it waits indefinitely until forced to shut down.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The immediate solution is to create a new folder in P8 and change the export to point to that folder. The longer term solution is to do one of the following: 

 * Modify the application to send each batch to a different folder. 
 * Modify the application to send a unique file name for each document.
