APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is continuation of COGCQ00292486. We found out that
   customer is using a Websphere monitoring tool called Wily (from
   CA, appears on IBM partner pages).  When this tool is in use,
   any C8 (8.4.1 FP2) deployment fails with a java crash. Even when
   the tool is disabled afterwards, new deployment jobs go straight
   to pending state. The only known way to restore the deployment
   functionality is to restore the content store from a pre-crash
   state backup (NC DROP script does not help).  We do not have
   WILY to test, so cannot reproduce the actual process of crashing
   but we do have the copy of the crashed content store which
   exhibits the behavior (any new deployment goes to pending). This
   is reproducible inhouse even with Tomcat, so it shows a
   corruption in the content store.    Even though customer
   actually discovered a workaround (start WILY with the old
   xCLASSPATH option instead of -javaagent), they would still like
   to know if it was possible to examine the content store and get
   details on the actual corruption to possibly find out - without
   having WILY inhouse - how it happens.  Already explained the
   customer that this might very well be a fruitless exercise but
   they still insist.    Details in testcase.
