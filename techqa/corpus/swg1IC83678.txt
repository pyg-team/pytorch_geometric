APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A firmware upgrade changes the WSDL option settings such as
   'Schema validate request messages', 'Do not schema validate SOAP
   headers', etc. under the Web Service Proxy Policy.
   
   This only affects the display in the WebGUI. The configuration
   will still work as configured.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add the subscription id manually
   through the CLI:
   
   Steps:
   1) co
   2) wsgw <wsp-name>
   4) no user-policy
   3) user-policy "" "" "" "" "" "" <user toggle values>
   <subscription name> on <fragment id>
   4) exit
   
   Subscription name can be found in the WSP Policy Tree and the
   Fragment ID is found under the Web Service Gateway Configuration
   object
   under the "User Policy" tab. Toggle values can be determined by
   running "show" before removing the user policy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  User toggles on the WSDL policy tree in the WebGUI do not
   accurately reflect the running configuration after a firmware
   upgrade to 3.8.1.x
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In firmware releases prior to 3.8.1.x the subscription name was
   not set on the user-policy object.
   After 3.8.1.x, the User Toggles on the WSDL policy
   tree are dependent on the subscription name in the user-policy
   to display properly.
   
   Fix is available in 3.8.2.14, 4.0.1.12, 4.0.2.8 and 5.0.0.1
