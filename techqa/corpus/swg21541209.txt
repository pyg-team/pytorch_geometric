PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Document extraction map is not correctly splitting documents for JD Edwards data (SCI62982) 

SYMPTOM
Map for the Document Extraction Service is not properly splitting the input file. 
Document extraction only splits the first document. then appends subsequent splits onto first split.


CAUSE
The extended rule did not properly account for the quotes around the data fields for JD Edwards data

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Modified the extended rule to account for the quoted data. To validate when to split the documents, the extended rule looks at the left-most two characters which equate to "1. It then looks at the right-most character within that selection which is 1.



string[1024] buffer;
string[1] match;
integer match_len;

// set these next two variables as desired
match = "1"; // header tag
match_len = 1; // the length of the tag

// read the block we're on and write it
readblock(buffer);
writeblock(buffer);

// keep reading and writing records until the end of the document
while readblock(buffer) do
begin
if right(left(buffer, 2),match_len) = match | buffer = "" then
begin
unreadblock();
break;
end
writeblock(buffer);
end
