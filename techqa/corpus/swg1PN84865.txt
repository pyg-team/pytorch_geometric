APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The NPF VTAM capture point will issue msgCSV002I, msgEZY0622s
   and msgEZY0653E after being active for an extended period of
   time.  The capture point will stop processing print requests
   after these messages are issued.
   The problem is related to the VTAM capture point only.  The VTAM
   capture point processing causes EZAPPFCM to issue a load for
   EZAPPFCF when a new dataset is opened.  FCM branches to FCF
   after a successful load.  FCF will then issue a load request for
   EZAPPFCA.  Both of these modules are linked REUS so the load
   only increases the use count.
   The VTAM capture point calls FCM to perform a RELEASE function
   after the current print request dataset is closed.  The release
   routine in FCM calls FCF to perform a RELEASE function.  The
   code in FCF frees up the working storage, but does not issue a
   delete request for EZAPPFCA before returning to FCM.  After
   control is returned to FCM, the working storage is released, but
   a delete request is not issued for EZAPPFCF.
   VERIFICATION STEPS:
   The VTAM capture point joblog will have the following messages:
   msgCSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE EZAPPFCA EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   msgEZY0622S LOAD failure for EZAPPFCA
   Routing: Major Key =          Minor Key =
   msgCSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE EZAPPFCF EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   msgEZY0653E Unable to load EZAPPFCF
   Routing: Major Key = UNKNOWN  Minor Key = UNKNOWN
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Periodically restart the VTAM capture point.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   For each print request processed, the NPF VTAM capture point
   issues a load for modules EZAPPFCA, EZAPPFCF, and EZAPPCTR.
   Since these modules are linked REUS, the use count is
   incremented for each load.  Once the use count exceeds the
   allowable maximum, message CSV002I is issued and the load fails.
   NPF will the issue message EZY0622S (for EZAPPFCA) or EZY0653E
   (for EZAPPFCF) and stop processing print requests.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  .
   The NPF VTAM capture point has been modified to load the
   EZAPPFCA, EZAPPFCF, and EZAPPCTR modules during initialization
   processing only.  The addresses for these modules are now
   kept in global storage and passed to the subroutines which
   previously issued the loads for each print request.
