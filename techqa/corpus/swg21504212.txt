PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When configuring Rulerunner threads in Rulerunner Quattro Manager with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture, a list of the tasks do not appear after selecting the three check boxes for the application on the Workflow:Job Task tab. Instead, an error appears stating:

Login error.
Could not login. User ID(domain\Windowsuser), Password or Station
ID is incorrect, or Station ID is already in use. Please correct and try again. 

CAUSE
This occurs when the Station ID is invalid or has not been given permissions for the application.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct: 

 1. Run Taskmaster Client and log in to the application. 
 2. From the Settings menu, select Stations. 
 3. If the station does not exist, select Add and create it using the Station ID configured in Rulerunner Quattro Manager. 
 4. If the station already exists, make sure that Permissions are checked for All or the tasks that Rulerunner will be executing.
