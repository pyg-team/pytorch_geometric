ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On the Physical Counts > Count List page multi-Bin records are
   not showing up for User.   For example, item A12345 is in BinA,
   BinB and BinC however, on the Count List Page only BinA is
   showing up.  Yet if they go to other pages on Mobile and use the
   Bin Look up all Bins have been downloaded - Or use the SQL
   outside of Mobile to see what the result set is all Bin Records
   show up.
   
   User said in Dec /Jan timeframe there was an issue
   around Bins and their mulit bins were showing up at one point
   for them - they are not sure what changed this.  Would you be
   able to check their xml to see why this would be happening to
   them.  On my build I do see multi-bin records on the Count List
   page.
   
   
   Note Below from User:
   
   Changing severity to 3 since we can workaround.  We found the
   XML is
   fine and multiple bins are now displaying.  The problem is both
   usequeries and queryrequired have been set to false but old
   queries we
   added are still in the MOBILEQUERY table and effect the query
   results.
   When you log on to Security Groups (Mobile), there are no data
   groups
   or queries displayed.  They only display when usequeries are set
   to
   true.  I suggest the MOBILEQUERY records be deleted when updated
   metadata files (e.g. mobileinv.xml) are imported that don't use
   them.
