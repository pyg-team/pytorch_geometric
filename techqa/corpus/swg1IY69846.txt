ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer has a problem to connect their Clustering SQL
   Server by our SQLServer agent.
   
   
   BCBS-IL installed MSCS on their server and SQL Server Monitoring
   Agent. They had two problem.
   
   1. They setup the named instance same as their hostname.
   And when they ran sqlserver monitoring agent, it couldn't
   connect to their server. It was trying to connect their server
   by host name even though their COLL_CLUSTER and COLL_SERVERID
   env were correct.
   
   
   Because KOQ_NAMED_INSTANCE setby 0, it caused the problem.
   Modify 'kddixdcl.cpp' and sent new kddirex.dll (
   newkddirex.zip ). It fixed their problem.
   
   2. Another machine also setup MSCS but this time, they setup the
   virtual server for their default server.
   
   That case, agent should make a connect only by hostname but it
   wasn't considered before. Sent a new fix kddirex.dll
   
   Made a new PTF and sent to customer ( kddirex0331.zip )
