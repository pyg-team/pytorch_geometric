Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In Cognos 10.2.2, user interface profiles could be configured to customise Workspace Advanced for different users, groups and roles.
Workspace Advanced is not present in Cognos Analytics, yet in Cognos Administration, the 'User Interface Profiles' tab is present in the sidebar under 'Security.'
Do user interface profiles have a different role in Cognos Analytics or are they obsolete? 

ANSWER
User interface profiles no longer have any effect in Cognos Analytics. 

Their documentation has been removed from the Cognos Analytics Knowledge Center. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEP7J_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.cbi.doc/welcome.html?lang=en]
