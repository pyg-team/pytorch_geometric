IBM Business Process Manager is a comprehensive BPM platform that gives you visibility and insight to manage business processes. It scales smoothly and easily from an initial project to a full enterprise-wide program. IBM Business Process Manager harnesses complexity in a simple environment to break down silos and better meet customer needs. 

Version 7.5.0 Fix Pack 1 introduces refactoring capability in the Process Designer tool. This capability allows a process designer to refactor common assets from the process application. This capability enables a Process Designer to move common assets like services from a process application to a toolkit or from a process application to another process application.

The fix pack also introduces support for Windows-based authentication for Microsoft SQL Server.
