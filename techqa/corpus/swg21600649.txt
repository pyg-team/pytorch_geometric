Title: IBM InfoSphere Streams SWS failure during instance startup and Unable to access NameService - United States

Text:
Streams not starting; Streams Nameservice TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Streams Web Service (SWS) fails when you start the instance. The following error message is displayed when the Streams instance starts: "ERROR: NSSupport.nsNameService() Unable to access NameService". 

CAUSE
This problem is caused by a bug related to the "leap second" adjustment on RHEL61 and CENTOS6.

ENVIRONMENT
This problem can occur in InfoSphere Streams version 2.0.0.2 and later.


In particular, it can occur under the following conditions: 

 * The host is running RHEL61 or CENTOS6 on an x86_64 architecture. 
 * The (optional) SWS is running. 
 * The NameServiceUrl property of the instance is set to the default value "DN:".


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Run this command to determine if the leap second adjustment has run: 


dmesg | grep leap 

This output is displayed if the leap second adjustment has run:

Clock: inserting leap second 23:59:60 UTC


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reboot the InfoSphere Streams host or enter: 

/etc/init.d/ntpd stop; date; date `date +"%m%d%H%M%C%y.%S"`; date 

then, if you rely on the ntpd daemon: 

/etc/init.d/ntpd start
