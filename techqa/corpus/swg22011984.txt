 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Initiate Master Data Service is vulnerable to multiple Apache CXF issues and could allow remote attackers to steal a victim's cookie-based authentication credentials and read arbitrary files on the system. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6812 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6812]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the FormattedServiceListWriter() function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the 'matrix ' parameter in a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120409 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120409] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-8739 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8739]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in JAX-RS implementation. By using a specially-crafted XML data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120408 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120408] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5653 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5653]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the improper validation of service response in JAX-RS XML Security streaming clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the servers.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5656 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5656]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the STSClient. By sending a specially-crafted token, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security restrictions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125216] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3156 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3156]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to use the OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using timing attacks to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
