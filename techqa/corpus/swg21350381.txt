 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Where can information be found on Cognos Metric Manager error codes? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error_language_text table in the content store database contains a list of error messages. Users can query that table to find the error text that correspond to specific error codes.

For example for the error code MLE-0104 has the text:

select error_cd, error_text from error_language_text where error_cd = 'MLE-0104'
