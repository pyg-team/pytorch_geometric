PROBLEM
In Lotus Domino, when you are creating an LDAP document in the Directory Assistance database (DA.nsf), there is an option to bind to the LDAP server using an LDAP user DN and password. These fields are encrypted, but not masked.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue has been reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# FBAY747KAQ as an enhancement request for a future version to change the password field-type from "Text" to "Password". The default access of a Directory Assistance database is Reader, so if you wish to hide the password, you must encrypt the document or change the Password field-type. 

To encrypt the document, follow the instructions in Notes Designer Help.

To mask the "password" field (replace the password text with asterisks) do the following:

1. Open the DirectoryAssistance form (in the da.nsf) in the Notes Designer Client.
2. Go to the LDAP tab.
3. Click on the "LDAPAdminPassword" field and open the Field properties infobox.
4. Change the 'Type' to "Password".
5. Save and close the form.

You will now see "*******" instead of "password" in this field for every LDAP [DA] document. 

Notes: 

 * If the database (.NSF) inherits the design from the template (.NTF), you might need to make the change on the template. 
 * This behavior is working as designed. It is not necessarily the admin password that is specified for the optional authoring credentials (it can be any designated credentials).
