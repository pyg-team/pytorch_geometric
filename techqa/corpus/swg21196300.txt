QUESTION
In Lotus® Domino® Web Access (iNotes™ Web Access) 6.5.2 - 6.5.4 you create a new memo and type in a few lines of text without pressing the ENTER key. You then print the memo and notice the word wrapping is not working correctly. Portions of the words are cut off on the right side and printed on the next line. There is no truncation and no characters are missing; they appear on the next line.


For example, this is how the text looks in the new memo: 


this is a very long sentence probably going to be run on to test problem that the 
customer says he is having with printing text without hitting the enter key, mine 
seems to wrap automatically I will see if this works correctly printing this memo to 
see if I can reproduce the problem 


This is how it prints:

this is a very long sentence probably going to be run on to test problem that the customer says h 
e is having with printing text without hitting the enter key, mine seems to wrap automatically I wil 
l see if this works correctly printing this memo to see if I can reproduce the problem 


ANSWER
This issue was reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# IMAO66SNQF, and has been fixed in Domino Web Access (DWA) 6.5.5 and 7.0. This issue does not occur in DWA 8.0. 


Excerpt from the Lotus Domino Release 6.5.5 MR fix list (available at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus]):

Note: The Domino Server must be upgraded to 6.5.5 in addition to the iNotes template to implement this fix; simply upgrading the template to 6.5.5 (or 7.0) does not resolve it. 



In a similar case, the text can be completely cut off (rather than wrapping oddly) when printing from DWA. For more information refer to the technote, "Domino Web Access: Text truncated when printing memo with long lines" (# 1087256 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21087256]).
