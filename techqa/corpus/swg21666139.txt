Title: IBM Cannot generate Excel file. Invalid column index (1638) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error "Cannot generate Excel file. Invalid column index (1638)" is thrown when retrieving the Excel output values file in the report of a DVS test. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is thrown when retrieving the Excel output values file generated when you select the option "Create an Excel file separate from the report to store the output values" of a DVS test: 

 *  Cannot generate Excel file
   
   Invalid column index (16384). Allowable column range for EXCEL2007 is
   (0...16383) or ('A'...'XFD') 


CAUSE
This is a documented limitation of Excel: the maximum size of a worksheet is 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. You can refer to the Microsoft Excel specifications and limits [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-specifications-and-limits-HP010342495.aspx] for more information.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the "Ignore for DVS" BOM flag to reduce the number of columns in the generated Excel files. 

See "Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Decision Server Rules > Testing and simulating rulesets > Working with Excel scenario files > Removing columns from the Excel file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.designer.test/topics/tsk_delete_excelcolumns.html]" for more information.

Beyond a certain number of columns, it becomes difficult to visually review all the data, so you should reduce the number of columns as much as possible using "Ignore for DVS".
