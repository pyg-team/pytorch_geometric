Title: IBM Support Assistant Data Collector for ITCAM for Transactions Usage - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you install and run IBM Support Assistant Data Collector for ITCAM for Transactions to quickly collect diagnostic files to aid in problem resolution? 

ANSWER
Use IBM Support Assistant Data Collector to collect log files. IBM Support Assistant Data Collector for IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) for Transaction knows the data files that IBM Support analysts need to aid in identifying, diagnosing, and recovering from occasional operational problems with ITCAM for Transactions. By using IBM Support Assistant Data Collector, you can collect files automatically and package them for sending to IBM or for your own analysis.
Installation Instructions:
Contact Customer Support for a copy of the ITCAM for Transactions ISA-DC. The tool is also included with ITCAM for Transactions 7.4 agents and can be found in the $CANDLEHOME/tmaitm6/tools/isadc folder.

Using the ISA DC tool:

1. Decompress the zip file.

This creates an isadc directory. If you do not have an unzip utility on your platform, you can use
'jar -xvf filename' from any Java Runtime.

NOTE: This step is not required if you are using the version included with an ITCAM for Transactions agent.

2. Before running the ISA DC tool

Find your ITM Java Runtime by executing:
C:\IBM\ITM\InstallITM\CandleGetJavaHome.bat
or
/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/CandleGetJavaHome
Prepend the Java path to your PATH or set it as your JAVA_HOME. If you do not do this you are prompted for the Java Runtime Environment path, or your system's default Java Runtime can be used.

E.g. for Windows
set PATH=<javapath>\bin;%PATH%
or for Linux and UNIX
export PATH=<javapath>/bin:$PATH

NOTE: On 64 bit systems, a 32bit JRE should be used otherwise portions of the data collection do not function as expected.

3. Launching the ISA DC tool

For Linux and UNIX platforms you may need to add the execution permission on the file script 
`chmod u+x isadc/isadc.sh`

NOTE: for Transaction Tracking stop the Transaction Collector and Transaction Reporter before collection; for use with MQ we recommend running as a user with group access to both MQ and ITM; For use with RRT on Windows the Agent must be stopped before collection.

Run the tool as an appropriate user. If multiple applications and users are involved, you may need to run the tool for each user. If gathering ITM files or agent information, run as the user they normally function. If gathering data for another application (such as MQ) run the tool as a user with access to those files (for MQ this may be the user 'mqm'). 

To run the command line interface simply execute isadc\isadc.bat for Windows or isadc/isadc.sh for Linux and UNIX.

For usage assistance, pass the "-help" command line option to the script.

To run the Web user interface simply open isadc\index.html in a web browser.
