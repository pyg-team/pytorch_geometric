QUESTION
 Why can't nzreclaim reclaim space while there is an active Tx-Idle? 

ANSWER
The nzreclaim command can't reclaim any space if there is an active transaction.
Deleted records are marked with the ID of the transaction that deleted them. Record-level reclaim filters delete records based on a "safe" transaction ID returned by the transaction manager. This ID is the most recent transaction whose records can safely be reclaimed because they can't be undeleted by rolling back a transaction. If the safe transaction ID is "older" than the transaction ID in a deleted record, the deleted record isn't yet available for reclaiming. Therefore, it may take a while for deleted records to become available to be reclaimed.

In order for nzreclaim to reclaim all the data space, you must end any unwanted transactions or wait until all of the outstanding transactions have completed and try the reclaim again.
