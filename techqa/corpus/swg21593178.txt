PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) for WebSphere Application Server is an optional component that provides response time and CPU usage statistics for WebSphere Application Server applications. This component is only available as a download, and it is not available as part of the WebSphere Application Server V8.5 product. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Obtain the ITCAM for WebSphere Application Server component from the following website:
https://www.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/ismlibrary/ [https://www.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/ismlibrary/]


The ITCAM for WebSphere Application Server component is composed of a data collector. Configure the data collector to a WebSphere Application Server instance. The data collector then runs within the same JVM as the application server and captures information about the running applications. When you configure the data collector, a new Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) module is created in the application server. The data that ITCAM for WebSphere Application Server provides augments the data provided by the application server through the existing PMI statistics.
