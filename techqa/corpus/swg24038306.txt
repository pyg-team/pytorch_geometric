INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Remediation Steps: Apply this interim fix to your environment.


IBM has released a generally available interim fix to resolve several issues in Multi-Enterprise Integration Gateway. We recommend that all Multi-Enterprise Integration Gateway customers download this interim fix and apply it to their environments immediately.

• If you are not running a customer specific interim fix, you must apply this interim fix to resolve these issues. 

Note: You must already have V1.0, Fix Pack 1 installed, prior to applying Interim Fix 4. Interim fixes are cumulative, Interim Fix 4 includes the fixes for Interim Fixes 1, 2, and 3.

Follow the instructions below:

1) Download the interim fix (filename: IBM_Multi-Enterprise_Integration_Gateway_V1.0.0.1_4_iFix_Media.zip) containing the resolutions for these issues from Fix Central. 

2) Install the interim fix on each node in your environment. Remember that applying this interim fix will require a node outage. IBM recommends that you apply the interim fix to your test environment first and run your regression tests against it before applying it to production.
