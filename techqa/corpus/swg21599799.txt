Title: IBM Launch the TDWC to directly display the results of a query - United States

Text:
TDWC; Direct Query; Create URL TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can you create a bookmark in a web browser for specific queries on the Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) Engine using Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC)? 

ANSWER
To create a basic URL to Open TDWC, perform the following steps: 
1. Define the URL to access the Dynamic Workload Console:

https: //{WebUIHostname:adminSecurePort}/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.External.navigation&showNavArea=false

where:

WebUIHostname is the fully qualified hostname or the IP address of the computer where the Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console is installed.

adminSecurePort is the number of the port on which the Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console is listening.


Example: 

https: //mypc:29443/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.External.navigation&showNavArea=false


2. Specify the action that you want to run, by specifying the corresponding parameter:


&action - indicates the action that you want to perform and can have one of the following values:

BrowseJobs
ZBrowseJobs
BrowseJobStreams
BrowseCriticalJobs
BrowseWorkstation
InternalTask


3. Specify the engine on which you want to run the query by entering its parameters: 

&hostname - For distributed environments, this is the host name or TCP/IP address of the computer on which the Tivoli Workload Scheduler engine is installed. 

For z/OS environments, this is the host name or TCP/IP address of the computer on which the z/OS connector is installed.

&port - Specifies the port number that is used to connect to the computer on which the Tivoli Workload Scheduler engine or the z/OS connector is installed.

Typically, the default port numbers are:

Default port numbers

Port 
number Engine

31117 Tivoli Workload Scheduler distributed engine

31127 Tivoli Workload Scheduler for z/OS engine with z/OS connector V.8.3

31217 Tivoli Workload Scheduler for z/OS engine with z/OS connector V.8.5 or higher

&server - This parameter applies to z/OS systems only and is mandatory. It is the name of the remote server of the engine as it was specified in the z/OS connector.

Example: 
&hostname = webuidev&port = 31217&server = C851

Example of a complete URL: 
https: //mypc:29443/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.External.navigation&showNavArea=false&action=BrowseJobs&hostname=webuidev&port=31117

Advanced optional parameters: 

Depending on the query whose results you want to view, you can complete your URL with the following parameters.

Monitor Jobs on distributed systems: 

Create a URL by specifying the BrowseJobs action, as described in “Creating a basic URL” on page 77 of the Administrator's Guide.

You can also specify any of the following filters:

&workstation - Filter by the workstation on which the jobs runs.
&jobstream - Filter by the job stream that contains the jobs.
&job - Filter by the job name.
&schedtime - Filter by the job scheduled time.
&status - Filter by the job status. You can filter by one or more statuses. Possible values are:

W Waiting
O Successful
H Held
R Ready
E Error
U Undecided
S Running
C Canceled
B Blocked

&columns - Specify the number of columns that you want to display in your result table. If not specified, the default number of columns for this query is shown. Supported values are:

Min - Display a minimum set of columns
All - Display all columns

Example:

https: //mypc:29043/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.

External.navigation&showNavArea=false&action=BrowseJobs

&hostname=webuidev&port=31117&workstation=my_ws&jobstream=my_js_name&job=my_job_name&status=ESB&columns=ALL

Monitor Critical Jobs: 

Create a URL by specifying the BrowseCriticalJobs action, as described in “Creating a basic URL” on page 77 of the Administrator's Guide.

You can also specify any of the following filters:

&workstation - Filter by the workstation on which the job runs.
&jobstream - Filter by the job stream that contains the jobs.
&job - Filter by the job name.
&schedtime - Filter by the job scheduled time.
&columns - Specify the number of columns that you want to display in your result table. If not specified, the default number of columns for this query is shown.

Supported values are:

Min - Display a minimum set of columns

All - Display all columns


Example: 

https: //mypc:29043/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.

External.navigation&showNavArea=false&action=BrowseCriticalJobs

&hostname=webuidev&port=31117

&workstation=my_ws&jobstream=my_js_name

&job=my_job_name&server=C851&columns=Min

where &server is a parameter used for z/OS only.


Monitor Job Streams: 
Create a URL by specifying the BrowseJobStreams action, as described in “Creating a basic URL” on page 77 of the Administrator's Guide.

You can also specify any of the following filters:

&workstation - Filter by the workstation on which the job stream runs.
&jobstream - Filter by the job stream name.
&columns
- Specify the number of columns that you want to display in your result
table. If not specified, the default number of columns for this query is
shown. Supported values are:

Min - Display a minimum set of columns
All - Display all columns


Example: 

https: //mypc:29043/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.

External.navigation&showNavArea=false&action=BrowseJobStreams
&hostname=webuidev&port=31117
&workstation=my_ws&jobstream=my_js_name



Monitor Workstations: 
Create a URL specifying the BrowseWorkstation action, as described in “Creating
a basic URL” on page 77 of the Administrator's Guide.

You can also specify any of the following filters:

&workstation
- Filter by the workstation on which the job stream runs.
&columns
- Specify the number of columns that you want to display in your result
table. If not specified, the default number of columns for this query is

&workstation=my_ws&jobstream=my_js_name
&server=C851&columns=ALL

where &server is a parameter used for z/OS only.


Existing task: 
Create a URL by specifying the InternalTask action, as described in “Creating a
basic URL” on page 77 of the Administrator's Guide.

You can save this URL can be saved as a bookmark in your browser, so that, by clicking the bookmark, you can directly open the results of a previously created task.


To save a task URL, perform the following steps: 
1. Create a task with the Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console:

2. From the displayed panel, click the Add bookmark icon to save this link in your bookmarks.

3. Specify a name for the new bookmark. By default the task name is used. Organize your bookmarks for your convenience, for example, you might organize your saved tasks in a different folder for each engine.


Example of a saved bookmark: 

https: //cairapc:29043/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.
External.navigation&showNavArea=false
&action=InternalTask&hostname=fferrar4&port=31117
&taskname=All%20Jobs%20in%20plan%20for%20ferrari

Starting from this bookmark you can manually create a URL as follows:

https: //mypc:29043/ibm/console/xLaunch.do?pageID=com.ibm.tws.WebUI.

External.navigation&showNavArea=false&action= InternalTask
&hostname=webuidev&port=31117
&server=C851 &taskname=myTask
