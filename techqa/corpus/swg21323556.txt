QUESTION
 There isn't VBA on Solaris, how do I access the API? 

ANSWER


Rhapsody users on a Solaris platform can access the Rhapsody API using VBScript (Visual Basic Scripting edition), a cross-platform development language. Running VBScript: The setup for running VBScript scripts is now done during installation. But there are still some actions that users must take to get started:  

 *  Before running a VBScript script, the user must run Rhapsody at least once for registration of the COM interfaces in the registry. 
 *  Run the script VBS located in the Rhapsody home directory. 
 *  Use the vbstest program by mainsoft to run vbs programs. 
 *  VBScript samples are available in the Samples/VBS directory of the Rhapsody installation. 

 

 See the online help for further info and VBScript samples.
