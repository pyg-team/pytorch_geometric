ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Mandatory attributes from Classifications not working if they
   are applied by Jobplans on Tasks
   
   Go to Classifications app and create a new classification.
   Make sure it is being used for objects JOBPLAN, JOBTASK and
   WOACTIVITY
   Make sure that your classification has 2 attributes, where 1 one
   them is
   mandatory on the WOACTIVITY object.
   Create a job plan with 2 tasks, and associate the classification
   you
   just created with the 2 tasks from this jobplan
   Associate the jobplan to a workorder, or create a new workorder
   and
   apply the recently created jobplan
   Make sure that your workorder has 2 tasks in the Plans tab,
   loaded from
   the jobplan.
   Go to Activities and Tasks app and search for the Tasks from the
   workorder
   You will see the Tasks are there, with the classification set,
   however,
   the attribute values are null, and if you try to save this task,
   you can
   normally save it.
   
   (When I apply this classification to a task manually the
   attributes are
   attached to the tasks and I am being prompted for entering
   values as
   expected)
   
   To verify the functionality of mandatory field I tried it out on
   changes and service requests. It all seems to work fine except
   when I
   use job plans to generate the tasks.
   However our workflow is applying the classification to a job
   task of a
   job plan and then applying this job plan to a change. In this
   scenario
   the attributes are attached to the activities as well, but I
   never get
   prompted for entering values when I save the activity.
   
   This is happening on core applications and SP applications,
   like,
   Activities and Tasks (SP) , Changes (SP) , etc...

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This is not a bug.  Even if  we fix the code to look at the
   mandatory flag defined at the Classifications app for
   woactivity, user will not be able to save the work order
   because they will have no way to give values when the
   WORKORDERSPEC is being copied from JOBTASKSPEC.  By design,
   workorderspec is copied from jobtaskspec when jobplan is
   entered for a work order - they are not regenerated.  As a
   workaround, user can setup mandatory flag for JOBTASK object
   for the attributes in the Classifications app. In the Work
   Order Tracking app, JOBTASKSPEC is visible in the
   Specifications tab, user can enter values right in the app when
   they try to save the work order but the JOBTASKSPEC is
   requiring values. When the JOBTASKSPEC has values, the values
   will be copied to the workorderspec generated in the run time.
