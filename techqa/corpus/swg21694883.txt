CAUSE
The wrong password was entered for the Password for the Directory service user account in the "Configure the General Properties for the Directory Service" screen. There is no option to test the LDAP connection, and clicking on the "Next" button does not return any errors.

ENVIRONMENT
P8 CPE 5.2.1

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Verify the password for the Directory service user (LDAP bind user) and update the "Configure the General Properties for the Directory Service" screen in ACCE with the correct password.
