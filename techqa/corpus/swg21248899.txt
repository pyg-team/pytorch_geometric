Title: IBM Remove a view or VOB tag using the uuid - United States

Text:
rmtag -uuid; rmtag -view -uuid; rmtag -vob -uuid; remove tag; remove vob; uuid; garbage; invalid; bad; corrupt tag; universally unique identifier; 1248899 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides a change request that has been opened to request the ability to remove a view or VOB tag using its universal unique identifier (uuid) when using IBM® Rational® ClearCase® or IBM Rational ClearCase LT®. 

SYMPTOM
 

In cases where a view or VOB tag is created using nonstandard or invalid characters, removing the object using either cleartool rmview or cleartool rmvob may fail.

CAUSE
 

In these instances, it is possible to unregister the object by specifying the uuid in the command, for example: 

cleartool unregister -view -uuid 1728ae68.fa364ad4.bcce.6e:b9:c8:44:03:1c 

Note: The uuid is displayed in the cleartool lsview -l output for the view. 

 

However, there is no -uuid option for use with the cleartool rmtag command from command line on UNIX®, Linux® or Microsoft® Windows®. 


Change request (RFE) RATLC01002678 has been opened to investigate adding a -uuid switch to the cleartool rmtag command and has been closed. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 


The decision was made by Product Management to exclude the resolution of this feature from future upgrades and releases of the ClearCase installation due to the significant architectural changes required to implement the solution.

WORKAROUNDS:


 * Microsoft® Windows®:
   The tag can be removed from the ClearCase Administration Console.
   
   Note: These steps illustrate removing a view tag, but the steps are similar for removing a VOB tag.
    1. Go to Start and browse to IBM Rational ClearCase > Administration > Administration Console:
       
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248899&amp;aid=1]
       
       
    2. Traverse to ClearCase Network > Host_Name > Views > View Storage > Tags:
       
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248899&amp;aid=2]
       
       
    3. In the right-hand pane > right-click the tag > All Tasks > Remove Tag:
       
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248899&amp;aid=3]
       
       
   
   
 * UNIX® or Linux®:
   
   There is no GUI workaround for this issue on UNIX or Linux hosts. Contact IBM Rational support for further assistance referencing this technote.
