Title: IBM Why do I lose my workstation connection when I do a batch scan? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 My workstation connection is being dropped whenever I try to scan in a batch of documents using IODM (ImagePlus Object Distribution Manager) and I am getting the following error messages: 
EKC0357A VTAM NODE ERROR SENSE DATA 800A0000
EKC0233A SESSION LOST MODERR: 
EKCBRCVO. 

ANSWER
The sense data message indicates that the PIU (path information unit) exceeds the maximum length, or that you don't have sufficient buffering. Since this error originates from EKCBRCVO, it appears that the object is too large for VTAM buffering. 

 * Check that the RECEIVE size definitions in CICS are correct. 
 * Be sure that the PACING and VPACING parameters, in the VTAMLST entry for the region, are set correctly.


To view the session definitions for the high-speed capture (HSC) workstation, you need to take a CEDA V GROUP(*) SESS(W003) of your IODM region. We see from the trace that there are two definitions for the same workstation; one with the RECEIVEsize set to 1920, the other with RECEIVEsize set to 30720. Your 'normal' workstation also has two session definitions, but both have the RECEIVEsize set to 1920.

You must have the same session definitions for the connection to work.
