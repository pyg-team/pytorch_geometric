* JCL - 20150601_01 based on Oracle 7u79-b14 

What date will Java 1.8 be installed with the agents? 
* There are currently no plans to move ITM to Java 1.8. Java 1.7 is still in support by Oracle and IBM. Updates to the ITM JRE are regularly published to address any security bulletins that affect ITM.

Is it possible to redirect the agent to use a different JRE? 
* No. 

Are there any plans to eliminate Java completely from the OS Agents? 
* Not for ITM. 
* APM reduces the need for/use of Java. And where it does use Java, it uses version 1.8.
