ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer does not accept that that the probe cannot
   configure/maintain the port and describes the scenario whereby
   the probe/element manager are unable to maintain the port;
   
   "We also tried to force the port to stay the same with the
   ORBLocalPort property, it made its job (in the sense that the
   source port did remain the same)
   but the IORs were different in any case, and, what's more, if
   the probe dies, it fails next connection attempt because the
   port remains opened."
   
   So in this sense theb probe is behaving abnormally with respect
   to the API client standards.
   
   The solution would appear to be to discuss the problem with
   Nokia to see if there is something in the probe/element manager
   that can be done for a forced disconnection of the client.
   
   In the attached
   
   'Nokia FM CORBA Interface
   3GPP Compliant Northbound Interface
   Interface Specification'
   Chapter 9.3
   
   it is stated that:
   
   "When 3GPP Manager subscribes it is supposed to use a fix IOR
   for the SequencePushConsumer object in its attach_push call"
   
   and:
   
   "In the case where the 3GPP Manager is stopped without an
   unsubscribe being performed (i.e. manually killed or died), its
   subscription stays active. But when it is restarted and a new
   subscribe is attempted, the external manager will receive the
   exception ?AlreadySubscribed?."
   
   Instead, from the attached log of the probe we can see that, for
   repeated attempts, all probe IOR numbers are different!
   Therefore, when a "dirty" disconnection happens between the
   probe and IRPAgent, the next attach attempt is performed by the
   probe with a new IOR, while the old one remains in Nokia Netact
   NBIF subscription table indefinitely. No "Already subscribed"
   message will ever be received by the probe this way.
   After many attempts the 3GPP IRPAgent "believes" it has a large
   numbers of clients, to send events to, and it does, thus slowing
   down the throughput.
   
   We also tried to force the port to stay the same with the
   ORBLocalPort property, it made its job (in the sense that the
   source port did remain the same) but the IORs were different in
   any case, and, what's more, if the probe dies, it failes next
   connection attempt because the port remains opened.
