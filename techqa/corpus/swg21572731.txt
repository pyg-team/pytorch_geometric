RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are only two supported methods for installing the Operations Console (OC): 

 - You can use a graphical installation program, the so-called installation wizard.
- You can install the operations console in silent mode, using a response file you generated in a previous wizard-driven installation.

The Installation Guide includes X Windows as a prerequisite for the OC on Linux and AIX systems.
