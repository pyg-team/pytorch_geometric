ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer will see intermittent SIGSEGV and SIGILL abends of
   the DataFlowEngine process when the HTTPRequest Node sends an
   HTTP request. This occurs on multiple platforms including AIX,
   Linux and Windows. The message flow abends when an HTTPRequest
   Node is configured with "Replace input message with web-service
   response" unchecked and "Response message location in tree" set
   to OutputRoot.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All Users of WebSphere Message Broker V7.0.0.0 running message
   flows containing an HTTPRequest Node.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When an HTTPRequest node is placed in a flow its default
   properties include:
   "Replace input message with web-service response" - checked
   "Response message location in tree" - OutputRoot
   
   When the properties are changed to:
   "Replace input message with web-service response" - unchecked
   "Response message location in tree" - OutputRoot
   
   then the WMB toolkit recognises that the location is the
   default and does not send it to the broker resulting in
   improper node initialisation leading to an access violation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to initialise the
   node properly.
