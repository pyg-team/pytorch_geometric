Title: IBM iNotes doesn't load using IE9, IE10 or IE11 within an iFrame, including the iNotes portlet - United States

Text:
ie; ie9; iframe; iNotes portlet TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When using Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 with the iNotes portlet for WebSphere Portal, you get errors in the iNotes console.

CAUSE
The iNotes portlet is an iframe portlet, and Internet Explorer 9 can fail in rendering iframes due to changes in that version for iframe handling.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To avoid the errors and work successfully with the iNotes portlet in IE9, add the following flag to the header of any pages that contain an iframe portlet: 

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE8" />
This flag causes the browser to switch to Internet Explorer 8 compatibility mode; therefore, the portlet works as expected.

To avoid the errors and work successfully with the iNotes in an iFrame using IE10, the solution is adding the following META tag to the HTML which contains the iFrame tag.
<META http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE9" /> 
This flag causes the browser to switch to Internet Explorer 9 compatibility mode; therefore, the portlet /iFrame works as expected.

Currently, there are no plans to create a new iNotes portlet that does not use iframes. However, we are re-designing the iNotes code and targeting changes to use HTML5 standards mode for Internet Explorer in a future version of iNotes, so that this emulation mode will no longer be necessary.
