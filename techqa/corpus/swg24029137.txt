List of minimum levels of required fix packs and interim fixes for WebSphere Application Server and Process Server deployed with WebSphere Portal version 7.0.0.1. 

The required fix pack level and additionally recommended maintenance for WebSphere Portal V7.0.0.1 to function properly when deployed with WebSphere Application Server or Process Server is listed in this document. The minimum fix pack levels required are: 


 * WebSphere Application Server: V7.0.0.13 (distributed platforms) 
 * [optional:] WebSphere Process Server (client code version tested): V7.0.0.3 
 * [optional:] WebSphere eXtreme Scale: V7.1.0.0 
 * [optional:] WebSphere Virtual Enterprise V6.1.1.2

Installation and support for these fixes and fix packs is provided by the appropriate WebSphere product support teams, not WebSphere Portal support. When installing non-Portal interim fixes, you must use the appropriate Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21205991] which is not provided with the downloads, and NOT the WebSphere Portal Update Installer. 

Service releases later than the levels listed above might also be used and in most cases are considered to be untested but supported as described in the WebSphere Portal Support Statement [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/WebSphere_Portal_Support_Statement_wp7]. 

Customers choosing to install a later service level of WebSphere Application Server or Process Server must ensure on their own that the level they are using includes some or all of the co-requisite Application Server or Process Server interim fixes listed in the Information Center and Release Notes, and then install any additional individual interim fixes not included.

The fixes listed below are needed to address any specific problems documented in the associated APARs, in addition to the minimum fix pack level listed above:
