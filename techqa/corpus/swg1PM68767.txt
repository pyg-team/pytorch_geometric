   Missing continuation character (\) on the
   "-Dfile.encoding=${FILE_ENCODING}"  line in
   configManagerLauncher.sh causing error during  Business Process
   Management 8 install on IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5.
   Adding the continuation character allows the command to
   complete successfully.
   Received message "Configuration errors were detected during
   the installation.  " at the end of installation. And the
   following warning in the Installation Manager logs:
   <entry num='246' time='1336666138215' elapsed='06:29.93'

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Due to the missing continuation character (\) the command does
   not complete successfully and configManagerLauncher.sh fails
   to run. To avoid this problem the continuation character (\)
   was added on the line "-Dfile.encoding=${FILE_ENCODING} \" in
   the configManagerLauncher.sh.
