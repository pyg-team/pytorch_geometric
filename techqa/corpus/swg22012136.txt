PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My Java API plug-in for IBM Rational Rhapsody crashes when it should be exiting the plug-in due to the system.exit call. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You have used the system.exit function in your plug-in code, and Rhapsody crashes at that point in the code.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The system.exit call should not be used within a Rhapsody Java API plug-in; terminating the execution of the plug-in in this way causes Rhapsody to crash. Instead, it is recommended to handle any errors that are encountered by outputting them to the Rhapsody log.
