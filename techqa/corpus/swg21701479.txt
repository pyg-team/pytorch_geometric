Oracle 12c TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I perform a fresh installation of Content Manager Enterprise Edition version 8.5 fix pack 2 or higher with an Oracle 12c database running on Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard? 

CAUSE
Support for Oracle 12c databases was added in Content Manager Enterprise Edition (CM) version 8.5 fix pack 2 (FP2)

ANSWER
Important information about the Oracle 12c versions and the related Oracle patches which are required by Content Manager Enterprise Edition V8.5 FP2 or later: 

 * 
 * 
 *  For Linux x86_64, Solaris, or AIX: Patches 18169693, 19920266, 20051833 Windows: Oracle Windows bundle patch 12.1.0.1.19 (patch 20912366) 
 * 
 *  For Linux x86_64, Solaris, or AIX: Patches 19920266, 20051833 Windows: Oracle Windows bundle patch 12.1.0.2.5 (patch 20684157) 

With CM version 8.5 and later, it is possible to install, but not configure base versions, then install and configure on a later fix pack level


Here is the high-level process to use: 

 1. Install Windows Server 2012 Standard R2 according to documentation 
 2. Install and configure Oracle 12c with listeners prepared according to CM 8.5 Oracle 11g procedures (see this tech note for information on the Oracle configuration [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688665]) 
 3. Install and configure a supported version of WebSphere Application Server (if installing the CM resource manager on the same server as the library server) according to documentation 
 4. Set the environment variable IBM_CM_ALLOW_ORACLE_12C=TRUE as indicated in the tech note above 
 5. Set the environment variable IBM_CM_LOGLEVEL=7 to enable debug level installation and configuration logging as described here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRS7Z_8.5.0/com.ibm.installingcm.doc/dcmit355.htm?lang=en] 
 6. Run the Content Manager Enterprise Edition 8.5 GA installer -- do not choose the option to configure Content Manager at this time 
 7. Run the Content Manager Enterprise Edition 8.5 FP2 (or higher) installer -- after installation completes, choose the option to configure CM
    


This should allow for a fresh installation of CM 8.5 FP2 or higher with Oracle 12c on a Windows Server 2012 Standard R2 server. 

 * NOTE: This behavior is different than in versions and fix pack levels of CM earlier than version 8.5, and it is possible because the entire installation and configuration routine was changed in CM 8.5 in order to allow for remote configuration of CM servers 
 * Should you run into any issues during installation or configuration of Content Manager using the above process, please create a PMR for IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition Server Level 2 Support
