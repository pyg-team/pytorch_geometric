Title: IBM HTTPs download not working - United States

Text:
patch; https; download; timeout TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Starting from the beginning of October most of the Fixlets in the Patch Management Sites include pre-fetch of patch binaries using “https” URLs. It has been observed that when downloading from https URLs through a proxy, the Bigfix Server can fail with a timeout error. 

CAUSE
Until a fix will be available to address the above issue, customers may consider to use ad interim the following workaround based on the “File Pre-cache Wizard” available on BES Support Site.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following procedure documents a simple workaround to pre-cache on the server multiple patch binaries, with few simple steps, leveraging the “File Pre-cache Wizard” available on BES Support Site.


1) From the Console Portfolio, select the “File Pre-cache Wizard” available on the BES Support Site.

2) In the “Select Site” panel, select the site of interest (e.g. Enterprise Security (Patches for Windows)) and click Next. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969510&amp;aid=2] 

3) In the “Specify Search Criteria” panel, choose the filter criteria that you prefer to identify the Fixlets that you would like to pre-cache. (e.g. fixlets released in October 2015) and click Search.

4) In the “Select Fixlets to Pre-Cache” panel, select the fixlets that you are interested in and click Finish. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969510&amp;aid=4] 

A Bigfix Action will be created that includes in the action script all the prefetch 

statements of all the selected fixlets. 

The above mentioned prefetch statements need to be edited in order to replace where needed the https URLs with the corresponding http URLs.

5) The Operator has to select the BigFix Server machine in the target tab and click OK to submit the action. 

6) All the files referenced in the above action will be pre-cached on the server, so when this action has been completed you can submit successfully all the fixlets selected in step 4. 

The download for them will not fail anymore being the file already cached on the server. 

Note: The Pre-cache workaround may require to increase the Server Cache size to make sure that the cache folder is able to include all the files to be downloaded. 

To increase the cache folder you can leverage the official Task in BES Support Site that allows to easily configure the Server Cache: 

ID: 148 – Name: BES Relay/BES Server Setting: Download Cache Size 

If the server cache has not been enlarged enough there may be cases where the cache gets full leading to the deletion of some files already cached. 

In this situation after enlarging the Server cache, the generated pre-cache action has to be activated again.
