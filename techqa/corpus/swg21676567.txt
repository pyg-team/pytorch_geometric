Text:
TIPL2; login multiple attempts tries TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I have to enter user id password multiple time to login to TIP 

ANSWER
This is a known issue and is fixed in Tivoli Integrated Portal version 2.2.0.13. To resolve this issue please upgrade TIP to this version. Before upgrading check with product team if this version is certified with the product installed on your server.

If you can not upgrade and must require a test fix then open a PMR and provide below file:
<TIPHOME>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/isclite.jar 

If the server is already on TIP 2.2.0.13 and you are still having this issue then please clear the java and browser cache. Close the browser and restart it. After this check if the issue is still present.
