PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to reset the default access rights in Microsoft® Windows® Vista™ for the IBM® Rational® Robot Test folder. Windows Vista support was added in Rational Robot 7.0.1 iFix01 release. Additional configuration is required for users who are not administrators. 

CAUSE
In Microsoft Windows Vista, users who are not administrators are restricted from using system folders. When Rational Robot creates a new project, it will modify the RegisteredProjects.xml file in the Rational Test folder which is in a system folder. The default security model for Windows Vista will block this attempt and Rational Robot will not be able to update the file. An error message is displayed when a project is created. 

 * 
 * Access is Denied
 * 

The same error is displayed even when the project is being registered.
