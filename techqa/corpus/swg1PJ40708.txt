APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Continuable queries drop the cemp_partition_date comparison
   when the current query fails to return the full page size of
   results.
   
   CBR queries submitted without a specific SQL ORDER BY clause
   will by default be configured to run as continuable queries to
   improve performance. If date partitioning was configured at
   index time, the number of CBR indexes searched will further be
   reduced to only the indexes which contain data which matches
   the values of the partionable properties specified in the query.
   
   A problem can occur if the PAGESIZE setting (on the object
   store) is less than the FULLTEXTROWLIMIT (set either on the
   object store or overridden in the client API query).  Once any
   of the continuable query iterations produces a resultset
   rowcount less than the fulltextrowlimit, the subsequent
   queries will no longer use the partitionable query values to
   limit the search results.  This may be caused by an index
   being searched having fewer results than the
   FULLTEXTROWLIMIT or the total results being reduced by
   the Content Engine security filtering which restricts the user
   issuing the query only to objects they have permissions to
   view.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Anyone running CBR continuable query with date partitioning. *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * While running CBR continuable query with date partitioning,  *
   * the date partition criteria is removed from the query before *
   * issuing the join query between CBR hits and repository data. *
   * The date partition criteria is used to select collections to *
   * search. If the join query produces results less than the     *
   * page size specified on either the query itself or the object *
   * store, query needs to be re-issued in attempt to fill the    *
   * page. The reasons for the join producing less results than   *
   * the page size could be either full text row limit specified  *
   * on the query is less than the page size or security          *
   * filtering that Content Engine applies on the rows returned   *
   * from the repository or some other property criteria          *
   * specified on the query that limits the number of rows that   *
   * can be returned.                                             *
   * This re-issued query doesn't take into consideration the     *
   * date partition criteria specified resulting in search issued *
   * against all the collections producing wrong results.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 4.5.1-P8CE-FP008 or later versions.               *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Content Engine 4.5.1-P8CE-FP008 or later versions now correctly
   applies the date partition criteria.
