APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a DataPower service acts as an SSL server with server side
   session caching
   enabled it is possible for a malicious client to modify the
   ciphersuite
   associated with a saved session in that SSL server's session
   cache.
   
   The malicious client can only change the associated ciphersuite
   to a value
   that the SSL server would support on the initial handshake which
   limits
   the severity of this attack.  The attacker cannot associate a
   weak cipher
   with the session if the server does not support weak ciphers in
   the initial
   handshake.  By default the DataPower SSL server does not support
   weak
   ciphers in the initial handshake.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Yes.  Disabling Server-side Session Caching in a given SSL Proxy
   Profile
   object will avoid the problem for all subsequent SSL connections
   to services
   using that object.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fix the ciphersuite downgrade attack.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 3.7.3.17, 3.8.0.11, 3.8.1.10 and
   3.8.2.2.
