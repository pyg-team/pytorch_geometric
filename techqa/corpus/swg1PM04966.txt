   Testing Java thin client against a Websphere Application Server

   Option  Description
   WebSphere Application Server V7.0  Import the JAR files under th
   e following directories:
   
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\lib
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\plugins
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\?profil
   eName?\installedConnectors\wmq.jmsra.rar
   
   Depending on the nature of you application you may also need to
   add some property files by adding the following directory: ?inst
   allation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\?profileName?\prop
   erties
   ...'
   
   is inaccurate and should read:
   
   For WAS v7.0 with Java 6.0
   add appropriate runtime thin client jars
   from the WAS_HOME/runtimes directory
   ( == {RAD/RSA Install Dir}\SDPxx\runtimes\base_v7\runtimes )
   using:
   RC on Java Project ? Properties ? Java Build Path : Libraries Ta
   b ? Add External jars.
   
   This is documented in the WAS70 IC:
   Stand-alone thin clients
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/ccli_standaloneclient [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/ccli_standaloneclient]
   .html
   
   In WAS v6.1 {WAS_HOME}\runtimes\base_v7\runtimes
   There are few specific jars for web service java thin clients
   
   
   For the case of this limited use testcase such as JNDI Context a
   nd lookup, you can just use the
   com.ibm.ws.admin.client_7.0.0.jar (also available in WAS 6.1)
   Depending if this is an EJB, JPA, JMS or Web Service client you
   would us one of the other function/application specific jars as
   appropriate. Sometimes it is necessary to use com.ibm.ws.orb_7.0
   .0.jar for Namespcae issues.
   
   If the above thin clinet jars do no suffice, it may still be nec
   essary
   Import the JAR files under the following directories:
   
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\lib
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\plugins
       * ?installation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\?profil
   eName?\installedConnectors\wmq.jmsra.rar
   
   Depending on the nature of you application you may also need to
   add some property files by adding the following directory: ?inst
   allation_directory?\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\?profileName?\prop
   erties.
