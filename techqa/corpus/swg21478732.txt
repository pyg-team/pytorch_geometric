Title: IBM LM sentinel feature name = 0 instead of SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the WlmAdmin application, I see the feature name (under feature information) is displayed as 0 instead of SPSS. 
How can I change this to read SPSS?

Also the version number is set at 140 instead of 14.0 
How do I change this to read 14.0? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WlmAdmin is a 3rd party application over which we have no control

To find the corresponding product name and feature code, please make sure you have Sentinel License Manager 7.3.0.9 installed.

There is a separate application, "lmshowlic.exe", in the SPSSSentinel directory that displays the mapping between the feature code and the actual product name and version. Command line usage for this utility is 

lmshowlic server_name

This is documented on p. 9 of the Network License Administrator's Guide. 

We apologize for any inconvenienc
