Text:
SQL0968C; "The file system is full" ; 57011 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Customer run Database Wizard for creating databases with partial success, following databases failed to get created: 

 * Homepage 
 * Library 
 * Metrics 
 * Mobile 
 * Profiles 
 * Wiki
   

CAUSE
The disk where DB2 databases reside in has become full. 

Per System requirement for IBM Connections 4.5 on Linux [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=1316596301949&osPlatform=Linux]:
Database server:
Four processor cores per server, 2.0 GHz CPU speed, or higher
Minimum 8 GB of memory
- For enterprise-scale deployment, at least 20 GB of memory is recommended
50 GB of available disk space after installation and configuration of the base operating system


ENVIRONMENT
Redhat Enterprise Linux 6.4, DB2 9.7



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Checked the Dbwizard log files in db2inst1/lcWizard/log/dbWizard directory and found following error:

dbWizard/dbConfig_20140306_170734_homepage_createDb.log:
SQL0968C The file system is full. SQLSTATE=57011 


On Unix-based systems, this disk full condition may be due to exceeding the maximum file size allowed for the current userid. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Administrator dropped the databases, increased disk space for db2 instance, 

ran the chuser command to update fsize to unlimited for current userid "lcuser", 

then rerun the database wizard and it completed successfully.
