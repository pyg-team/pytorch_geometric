   during
   startup of every server/cluster, it will traverse datasource of
   every
   component via JNDI lookup, like BPC, ProcessServer,PerformaneDW.
   But every datasource has its specific scope, like
   PerformanceDW(jdbc/PDWDB) was created only in Support cluster so
   that
   some error like "First
   component in name PDWDB not found." would be thrown when
   attempting to
