PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There is an error in detecting the 64 bit plinux operating
   system and results into this incorrect HeapDetect setting.  With
   the fix of this APAR the setting on plinux will be set correctly
   and an ODR server should be able to be started after creation.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 9.0.0.7.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  In the server.xml of the ODR server, search for
   agentlib=HeapDetect text.  Update HeapDetect to HeapDetect64,
   then start the ODR server.
