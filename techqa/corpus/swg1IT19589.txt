APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the destination server for a syslog-tcp log target is
   unavailable, the CPU on the DataPower Gateway might rise
   dramatically due to excessive syslog-tcp connection attempts.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Many syslog-tcp targets going to a remote syslog server which
   is down might rise DataPower CPU usage.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Add tuning parameters to sylog-tcp logging targets to allow
   customers to reduce the syslog retries to the syslog server
   Fix is available in
   7.1.0.16, 7.2.0.14, 7.5.0.7, 7.5.1.6, 7.5.2.4 and 7.6.0.0
