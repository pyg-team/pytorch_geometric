APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Content Engine Client installer warning of a missing file
   resulted in the WorkplaceXT
   .war and .ear file updates being skipped but no log messages
   appeared indicating that fact.
   
   The problem cannot be reproduced on demand but was discovered
   after various
   other difficulties occurred during the install which required
   repeated runs of the client
   installer program. At one point, the installer reported a
   missing file:
   
   Tue Aug 23 12:43:54:180 Update Workplace XT
   Status: WARNING Additional Notes: WARNING - Tue Aug 23
   12:43:54:343 [ERROR]
   ServiceException: (error code = 200;
   message = "Do Not Install/download/isannotvalidator.jar
    (A file or directory in the path name does not exist.)";
   severity = 0;
   exception = [java.io.FileNotFoundException:
   Do Not Install/download/isannotvalidator.jar
   (A file or directory in the path name does not exist.)])
   
   Since this message was only a warning it was not obvious that it
   was a problem
   that had to be fixed before continuing with the rest of the
   install, upgrade or
   Fix Pack update.  If that step had been successful, the next
   actions would have
   been for the installer to update the WorkplaceXT .war and .ear
   files, as shown
   below in a successful update:
   
   Thu Aug 25 10:07:45:723 Update Workplace XT
   Thu Aug 25 10:07:46:653 [INFO] Run -
   
   /opt/IBM/FileNet/WebClient/deploy/create_web_client_war.sh
   Thu Aug 25 10:08:38:963 [INFO] Run -
   
   /opt/IBM/FileNet/WebClient/deploy/create_web_client_ear.sh
   
   Because of the warning, the .war/.ear updates were skipped but
   the log
   showed no evidence that this step had not occurred and
   subsequent
   attempts to log in via WorkplaceXT failed.
   
   Expected result: if the .war/.ear update is not performed, the
   log should
   indicate an unsuccessful installation or at the least point out
   that the
   .war/.ear update did not complete.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The Content Engine Client installer reports a missing file   *
   * while updating WorkplaceXT. The following message gets       *
   * logged in the log file                                       *

   * Because the customer hits the warning, the update to the     *
   * Workplace XT ear file gets skipped and the log has no        *
   * mention of th                                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The recommendation is to update to a recent fixpack version  *
   * of Content Engine Server 5.1.0.1-P8CE-FP001 or higher, and   *
   * run the recent fixpack version of Content Engine Client      *
   * Installer                                                    *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The 5.1.0.1-P8CE-FP001 fixpack installer has been modified to
   add the following log information, in the case of such a
   failure.
   
   The log file would indicate a FATAL ERROR instead of a Warning,
   and would have the following content
   
   Fri Mar 30 03:49:48:575 Unable to locate a Content Engine Client
   File: WorkPlace XT is not updated completely. Upgrade Content
   Engine Server and retry the Content Engine Client Install. If
   the problem persists, Please contact IBM Support
                             Status: FATAL ERROR
