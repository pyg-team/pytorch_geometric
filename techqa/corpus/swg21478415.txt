Title: IBM Statistics 18 will not run Python code after installing from Statistics 19 beta. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm also running SPSS 18.0.2 with the python plug in. After installing the 19 beta and installing the 19 plugin using the essentials installer, and verifying that 19 can run python code, I found that when trying to run python code using 18 (even 'print 'hello, world' '), I get the following error message (from 18):

>Error # 6887. Command name: BEGIN PROGRAM
>External program failed during initialization.
>Execution of this command stops.
Additional error message: spss.pth points to wrong plug-in version.

>Error # 6887. Command name: BEGIN PROGRAM
>External program failed during initialization. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is not a defect. This has always been the case, and the limitation is documented.
This is described in the section "Working with Multiple Versions of IBM SPSS Statistics" in IBM SPSS Statistics-Python Integration package.pdf, which is available from Help>Programmability>Python Plug-in, once you install Python Essentials.

Whichever version of Statistics and whichever plug-in was installed last, that should be the version of Statisticsw you start with. So for instance, assume both Statistics and Statistics 19 have been installed as well as their respective Python Plug-Ins. Further assume Statistics 19.0 was the most recently installed. So from within Statistics 19, it should be possible to query the currently in use plug-in with spss.GetdefaultPlugiInVersion()

Example:
import spss
version = spss.GetDefaultPlugInVersion()

Similarly, you can set the default plug-in version with spss.SetDefaultPlugInVersion("<version>")
Example:
import spss
spss.SetDefaultPlugInVersion("spss180")

From the moment you Set the default plug-in, you will need to be in the corresponding version to set it again. That is, once you are in Statistics 19 and set the default to 18, you must be in 18 in order to set it once more back to 19.

View the installed plugins with spss.ShowInstalledPlugInVersions()
Example:
import spss
versionList = spss.ShowInstalledPlugInVersions()
