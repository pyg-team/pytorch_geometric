Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am attempting to check out a commuter license via the SPSS Commuter License Utility. The server shows there are tokens left to check out, but when I check out the module, I receive one of the following alerts:

Sentinel LM: Error[77]: Not enough commuter token available on server

or 

Error while Check-out with errorcode: 77

What is the problem? 

ANSWER
Please have your System Administrator enable commuter licensing on the SPSS Sentinel License Manager machine:

1. On the SPSS Sentinel License Manager machine, right-click My Computer and choose Properties.

2. Click the Advanced tab and select Environment Variables.

3. Locate the LSERVOPTS system variable and edit it. Find the "-com 0" parameter and either remove it to make all network licenses commutable or change the value to the percentage of licenses you want to be commutable. A valid value is between 0 and 100.

4. Restart the computer
