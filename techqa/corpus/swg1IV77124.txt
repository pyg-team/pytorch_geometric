APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  REL: 6.30.01.00
   
   Problem:
   The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS fails in assigning the correct
   value to the File System Type attribute in the Disk attribute
   group, when a failure occurs while collecting the filesystem
   metrics, for example in case of a remote, unreachable
   filesystem. The type of filesystem is available anyway and the
   agent should be capable to return it correctly even for
   filesystems whose status is "Down" or "Not  Available".
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
    This issue affects all the UNIX OS versions since 6.22 FP3.
   
   Diagnostics:
   set KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:disk ALL) and look for the
   "filesystyp" value printed by "displayTableItem" method of the
   problematic filesystem. It will show up as "-2" instead of the
   expected value (e.g. "nfs3").
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium, situations trying to detect an error condition on a
   specific  type of filesystem do not work.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The File System Type attribute in the Disk attribute group of
   the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS cannot be used in situations
   that alert on remote filesystems becoming unavailable.  This
   kind of information is always locally available and it does not
   get lost when the remote filesystem becomes unreachable.
   Nevertheless the agent returns it as Not Collected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fixed to return the correct File System Type also for
   unreachable filesystems.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
