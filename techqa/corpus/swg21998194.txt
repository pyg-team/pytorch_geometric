Title: IBM Invalid R version error when installing the Essentials for R plug-in on Modeler Server 18.0 - United States

Text:
r version 3.2 3.2.2 plugin installation essentials essential modeler TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of the Essentials for R 18.0 plug-in on a Modeler Server host is failing with the error

"Invalid R version. The installed version of R is not supported". 


SYMPTOM
After the error "Invalid R version. The installed version of R is not supported" is displayed, the installer ends without making any changes to the Modeler Server installation.

Essentials for R installation logs capture the following:
Custom Action: com.ibm.spss.ia.MakeFailure_IA
Status: FATAL ERROR
Additional Notes: FATAL ERROR - class com.
ibm.spss.ia.MakeFailure_IA FatalInstallException: Error: Failed to
install R plugin



CAUSE
This issue was caused by an incorrect or invalid installation of R.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM SPSS Modeler Server 18.0
Linux RedHat
R 3.2

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Confirm that the correct version of R was installed by running the following command inside a R prompt:
$R.home/bin/R --version 2>&1 | grep "3.2.2"

The expected result would be:
R version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) -- "Fire Safety"

If the expected version is returned, the issue could still be caused by an incorrect install of R.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove the current installation of R.
Build the R core components as per our IBM SPSS Modeler - Essentials for R: Installation Instructions documentation.
Once R is built, re-run the Essentials for R plug-in installer.
