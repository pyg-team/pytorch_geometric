   ****************************************************************
   When a CICS resource definition for IPCONN, TCPIPSERVICE
   or URIMAP is installed, it is possible that the resource
   is installed with a reduced set of cipher codes.
   
   When the ciphers are specified by a cipher suite
   specification file then message DFHSO0145 is issued when
   a reduced set of cipher codes are installed. This message
   states the number of ciphers that have been removed from
   the cipher list. This is then followed by DFHSO0146 which
   details which specific ciphers have been removed.
   
   
   When the ciphers are specified by a list of 2-digit cipher
   suite codes then message DFHSO0145 and DFHSO0146 are not
   issued, so there is no easy way to know how many or which
   ciphers were removed.
   
   It is possible to take a CICS system dump and then review the
   SO domain to see which ciphers have been successfully
   installed. The user could then compare this installed
   list with the list they provided to the relevant resource
   definition.
   
   Messages SO0145 and SO0146 should be issued whenever a
   resourse is installed with a reduced set of cipher codes
   no matter what the cipher source is.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSOIS has been altered to issue messages DFHSO0145 and
   DFHSO0146 when ciphers are removed for both cipher lists
   and cipher files.
   
   DFHMESOE, DFHMESOC and DFHMESOK have been altered to update
   both messages DFHSO0145 and DFHSO0146.
   
   The CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Version 5 Release 3, CICS
   Messages and Codes Vol 2, GC34-7419-00, Chapter 4. DFH messages
   - DFHN to DFHZ, section DFHSOnnnn messages has been altered in
   two places.
   1. Message DFHSO0145 has been updated and will now read as
   follows:-
   DFHSO0145 W DATE TIME APPLID An installation using ciphers
   ciphersourcetype ciphersource has resulted in number ciphers
   being removed from the cipher list.
   Explanation: Whilst installing a resource using a ciphers list
   or file to specify the ciphers to use, a number of the ciphers
   have been removed because they are not supported by system SSL
   in the security environment requested for this CICS region.
   This message will be followed by one or more DFHSO0146 messages
   listing the ciphers.
   System action: As long as one cipher in the list is valid, the
   install proceeds successfully.
   User response: Ensure that the ciphers list or file only
   specifies valid ciphers.
   Module: DFHSOIS
   Message inserts:
   1. DATE
   2. TIME
   3. APPLID
   4. ciphersourcetype
   5. ciphersource
   6. number
   Destination: CSOO
   
   2. Message DFHSO0146 has been updated and will now read as
   follows:-
   DFHSO0146 I DATE TIME APPLID Ciphers removed: cipherlist.
   Explanation: This message follows message DFHSO0145 listing the
   ciphers that are not supported.
   System action: As long as one cipher in the list is valid, the
   install proceeds successfully.
   User response: Ensure that the ciphers list or file only
   specifies valid ciphers.
   Module: DFHSOIS
   Message inserts:
   1. DATE
   2. TIME
   3. APPLID
   4. cipherlist
   
   Destination: CSOO
