APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use the German locale to run an application that uses
   the Java Viewer Toolkit, some of the magnification options are
   not working.  Selecting a magnification option of "Actual Size",
   "Fit In Window", "Fit Height" or "Fit Width" from the list that
   is presented in the Zoom Options action does not change the
   scale of the document.
