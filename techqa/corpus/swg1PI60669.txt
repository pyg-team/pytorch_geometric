APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) allows you to filter query
   results  However, you cannot filter based on the owner names.
   
   Steps to Reproduce :
   1) Create a query, add Owned By as a column
   2) Use the "Type Filter Text" box to filter by a value that is a
   "Owned By" value
   3) Notice no work items are found
   
   Expected:
   -  Typing "BOB" in the filter text box should result in items
   that have "bob" in either the Summary or Owned By columns.
   -  Matching should be case insensitive
   -  Matching partial word should also work
   
   Actual:
   Case insensitive and partial matching is working, but the Owned
   By column is not being included.
