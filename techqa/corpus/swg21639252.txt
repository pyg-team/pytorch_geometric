Sterling Connect:Direct Windows netmap user export import cdconfig TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How should the Netmap and User Proxy information be exported and imported between 2 IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft Windows systems? 

ANSWER
Below are the steps to export the configuration files from Sterling Connect:Direct for
Microsoft Windows:

1. Click Start and point to Programs > Sterling Commerce Connect:Direct
Vx.x.xx> CD Configuration Tool.
2. From the File menu, select Extract. The Local Node Properties dialog
box is displayed:
3. Click OK. The network map and User Authorization information for the
node are extracted as as cascading windows named Map and User.
4. To save the extracted user authorization information:
a. Click the User dialog box to select it.
b. From the File menu, click Save As user.cfg.
c. Select the directory where you want to save the file.
5. To save the extracted network map information:
a. Click the Map dialog box.
b. From the File menu, click Save As map.cfg
c. Select the directory where you want to save the file.

To import a configuration file the you must execute the cdconfig.exe
utility from the command line (you can not import using the GUI tool)
and pass the node name and exported file, e.g User.cfg or Map.cfg.

The Connect:Direct service must be running. From a Command Prompt
within the Connect Direct\server directory, type the following:

cdconfig /q /nnodename /i /fmap.cfg

cdconfig /q /nnodename /i /fuser.cfg

Note: where /q specifies that the Configuration Tool runs silently
/n specifies the local CONNECT:Direct node
/i specifies to insert the map.cfg file into the Registry
/f specifies the file to insert into the Registry (include the full
path to the map.cfg file - for example: /fc:\directory\map.cfg)

Also the cdconfig.exe command takes care of decrypting the passwords
correctly so they remain the same on both the Prod and DR systems
