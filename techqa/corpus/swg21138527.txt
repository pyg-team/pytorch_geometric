QUESTION
 Identity Manager stores the LDAP, Database and system passwords for the in clear-text 
in the enRoleLDAPconnection.properties, enRoleDatabase.properties and enRole.properties files. How can these passwords be encrypted?


ANSWER
In the enRole.properties file, located in the <ITIM-HOME>/data directory. Open the file and look for the following stanzas: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Change the value to "true" and then saving the enRole.properties file will not encrypted the passwords. But will flag the passwords are being encrypted when they actually are not. 

The only way to encrypt and decrypt these values are via runConfig (found in <ITIM-HOME>/bin). On the runConfig System tab, there is a check box labeled "Encrypt DB, LDAP, and Application Server user passwords". When this box is checked and the OK box is clicked, the passwords will be encrypted. When the box is unchecked and the OK box is clicked, the passwords will be encrypted. 

If you manipulate the above flags, setting them from false to true and then executing runConfig, runConfig will fail to start with encryption errors. So the flags must be in sync with the current status (encrypted/decrypted) of the passwords.
