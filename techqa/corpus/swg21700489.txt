Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM PureApplication System (CVE-2014-3513, CVE-2014-3567, CVE-2014-3568) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities along with SSL 3 Fallback protection (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV) were disclosed on October 15, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM PureApplication System. IBM PureApplication System has addressed the applicable CVEs and included the SSL 3.0 Fallback protection (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV) provided by OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513]CVE-2014-3513 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513]

DESCRIPTION: 
OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by a memory leak in the DTLS Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension parsing code. By sending multiple specially crafted handshake messages, an attacker might exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all of the available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.

CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035]https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3567 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567]

DESCRIPTION: 
OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by a memory leak when handling failed session ticket integrity checks. By sending an overly large number of invalid session tickets, an attacker might exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all of the available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.

CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036] https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036] for more information

CVEID: CVE-2014-3568 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568]

DESCRIPTION: 
OpenSSL might allow a remote attacker bypass security restrictions. When configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers might accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions.

CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037] https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037] for more information
