 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I move my Datacap V9.0 application to Datacap V9.0.1? 

ANSWER
To migrate a Datacap application from V9.0.0 to V9.0.1, you must update the application database schemas. If your application contains compiled rulesets, you must update any rulesets that have been updated in V9.0.1. You can add accuracy statistics to an existing application. Datacap Navigator settings for certain tasks must be updated. If your application contains customized Desktop panels, you must rebuild them by using the updated project on DeveloperWorks. 

Procedure 

 1. Remove the Datacap V9.0 software and install V9.0.1:
    
    a. Back up your Datacap application folders. If you modified any of the standard Datacap applications, make a backup of those folders as well.
    
    b. On each computer that you are upgrading, uninstall Datacap V9.0 and then install Datacap V9.0.1 in the same location. Uninstalling V9.0 preserves all files that you added or modified. If you installed Datacap V9.0.1 over an existing instance of Datacap V9.0 (without uninstalling first), you can repair the system by following these steps. 
    
    Remember: The following steps are ONLY required after installing V9.0.1 without previously uninstalling an existing V9.0 system on that computer:  * 
     * 
     * a) From Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, uninstall any of the following if they exist:  * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * * DO NOT uninstall: IBM Datacap 9.0.1
        * 
       
       b) Delete any of the following if they exist. They will be restored with correct version after the next step:  * 
        * 
        * \Datacap\dcshared\ICRC
        * 
        *  \Datacap\dcshared\OCRA\Data\ExtendedDictionaries
        * 
        *  \Datacap\Flex
        * 
        *  \Datacap\Templates
        * 
        *  \Datacap\TravelDocs
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * \Datacap\dcshared\Accusoft.BarcodeXpress9.ActiveX.dll
        * 
        *  \Datacap\dcshared\NET\Accusoft.ScanFixXpress7.Net.dll
        * 
       
       
     * 
     * 
     * setup.exe /V"REINSTALLMODE=amus REINSTALL=ALL"
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * \Datacap\Taskmaster\TMS.exe /Service
     * 
    
    

2. If you modified any of the standard applications in V9.0 (for example, APT), and you need to preserve those changes, restore those application folders from the backups you made in step 1. 

3. Update database schemas for V9.0.1:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * i. Create full backups of the Admin, Engine, and Fingerprint database tables. 
   ii. Run the appropriate update scripts found in the \Datacap\support\DBScript\ folder:  *  If you are using DB2, start IBM Data Studio, connect to the application's database(s) and execute the scripts DB2_Adm_Upd901.sql, DB2_Eng_Upd901.sql, and DB2_FP_Upd901.sql If you are using SQL Server, start SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the application's database(s) and execute the scripts SQL_Adm_Upd901.sql, SQL_Eng_Upd901.sql, and SQL_FP_Upd901.sql If you are using Oracle, start SQL Plus or SQL Developer, connect to the application's database(s) and execute the scripts Oracle_Adm_Upd901.sql, Oracle_Eng_Upd901.sql, and Oracle_FP_Upd901.sql 
   
   

 * 
 * 
 * Prerequisite: Steps ii, iii, and iv require Microsoft Access 2013 or later. 
 *  
 * i. Replace the V9.0 Engine database file with an empty V9.0.1 Engine database. This step does not preserve existing batches.  * 
    * 
    * 
    * \Datacap\Templates\FormTemplate
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
   ii. If your application contains custom columns, use Microsoft Access to add your custom columns to the tmbatch table in the new Engine database. This step requires Microsoft Access 2013 or later. iii. Update the Fingerprint database schema to support the ClassifyLayout actions. This step is recommended if you have Microsoft Access 2013 or later, but is only required if you plan to use ClassifyLayout actions. 
   
    * 
    * \Datacap\Templates\FormTemplate\FormTemplateFingerprint.mdb
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   iv. You can update the Administrative database schema with tables and fields reserved for future use. This step is recommended if you have Microsoft Access 2013 or later.  * 
    * the following file: \Datacap\Templates\FormTemplate\FormTemplateAdm.mdb
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * db_keymode. 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * gr_key.
   
   

4. If your application contains any of the following rulesets, manually copy the updated versions to your application's Rules folder: Populate Fields Using Keywords, ExportToBoxRul, ImportFromBoxRul, and RecognizePagesAndFieldsRul. 

 * 
 * \Datacap\rrs
 * 
 *  Populate_Fields_Using_Keywords.Rul.dll ExportToBoxRul.dll ImportFromBoxRul.dll RecognizePagesAndFieldsRul.dll.
   
 * 
 * 
 * Rules 
 * 
 * \Datacap\TravelDocs\dco_TravelDocs\Rules\
 * 


5. If you want to add statistics collection to an existing application from V9.0 (to support the Dashboard feature for Datacap Navigator, to count checks processed, or for any other reason), copy the files Profile Statistics.rul and Export Statistics.rul to \Datacap\RRS, and then use FastDoc to drag the Profile Statistics and Export Statistics rulesets to your application. For example, manually copy \Datacap\Templates\FormTemplate\dco_FormTemplate\rules\ Profile Statistics.rul to \Datacap\RRS, and then use FastDoc to copy that ruleset to your application. 
6. Load the application in Datacap Studio and correct any action or rule errors: 

 * 
 * Start > IBM Datacap Developer Tools > Datacap Studio
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Next
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


7. To use new Datacap Navigator features, re-enter task settings for the following task programs: Scan.js, Classify.js, Verify.js, and Multiple. The following steps are required for each task that uses these Datacap Navigator task settings. If a task is used in more than one job, you need to re-enter task settings for one job only. To re-enter task settings:  * 
 * http://
 * host_name
 * :
 * port_number
 * /
 * context_root
 * /?desktop=dcadmin
 * 
 * navigator
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * i. In the left pane, click Workflows. 
   ii. In the right pane, select a workflow and click Edit. 
   iii. Click the Jobs tab, select a job, and click Edit. 
   iv. Click the Tasks tab, select a task, and click Edit.

8. If your application contains customized screen panels for Datacap Desktop thick client, you must rebuild them with the updated SDK for V9.0.1. This step requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.  *
