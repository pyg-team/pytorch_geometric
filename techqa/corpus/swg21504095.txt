SYMPTOM
This issue can also be encountered when publishing a workspace project to the WebSphere Commerce Developer Test server. 

CAUSE
There is not enough memory in the JVM to proceed with the installation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Ensure that there is enough memory available in the system when running the installation. Close all other running programs at this time to ensure that there is sufficient memory available. According to the hardware requirement set for the installation of WebSphere Commerce Developer Version 7.0: 

Minimum Recommended Intel Pentium III 800 MHz processor Intel Pentium 4 1.6 GHz processor 2 GB RAM 3 GB RAM. 13 GB hard disk space divided:  *  Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack 10 GB WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.1 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=1]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.2 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=2]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.3 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=3]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.4 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=4]Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1 10 GB WebSphere Commerce Developer 3.6 GB 

13 GB hard disk space divided:  *  Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack 10 GB WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.1 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=5]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.2 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=6]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.3 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=7]WebSphere Commerce Version 7.0.0.4 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504095&amp;aid=8]Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1 10 GB WebSphere Commerce Developer 3.6 GB 




2. To assign a dedicated memory amount for the installation, increase the size of memory as the installation is run again: 
 *  Edit the file WCDE_INT70\bin\setenv.bat change the line: 
 * set ECLIPSE_ANT=%RAD_HOME%\jdk\bin\java -cp "%ECLIPSE_CP%" org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main -application com.ibm.etools.j2ee.ant. RunAnt to 
   
   set ECLIPSE_ANT=%RAD_HOME%\jdk\bin\java -Xmx1024m -cp "%ECLIPSE_CP%" org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main -application com.ibm.etools.j2ee.ant. RunAnt 
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * -Xmx1024m 
 * 
 * 3. Try to rerun installation and make sure that there is no failure or error in the WCDE_installdir\logs\setup.log before proceeding with the publishing task. 
 * 


3. In addition to the above step if you are using the install manager to reinstall you can also increment the Installation Manager heap size. Since the Installation Manager core is based on Eclipse RCP it is possible change the heap configuration, adding VM arguments in the launched script:  

 *  Edit the file <Installation Manager inst path>\eclipse\IBMIM.ini; Add the heap max size according to the local resources (for example -Xmx512M reserves 512MB for the heap). For more information follow the Eclipse FAQ [http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F]. Save the file Restart the Installation Manager and run the installation once again.
