PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
IBM QRadar Network Security has addressed the following vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2018-1000001 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000001]
DESCRIPTION: Glibc could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow in the __realpath() function in stdlib/canonicalize.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system and obtain privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 8.4
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137516 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137516]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: CVE-2017-15804 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15804]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by glob function in glob.c. By using a specially-crafted file, a local attacker could overflow a buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133996 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133996]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2017-15670 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15670]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the glob function in glob.c. By sending a specially-crafted string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133915 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133915]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2017-12132 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12132]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by a flaw in the DNS stub resolver. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform off-path DNS spoofing attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129949 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129949]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-5180 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5180]
DESCRIPTION: glibc is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the res_query function in libresolv. By using a malformed pattern, a remote attacker could cause the process to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130620 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130620]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2014-9402 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9402]
DESCRIPTION: glibc is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the getanswer_r() function. If the DNS backend is activated, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99289 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99289]for the current score
