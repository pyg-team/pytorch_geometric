Title: IBM What does depluralize do exactly? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 From reading previous articles it sounds like it just does not work in non-english languages. Is that still true? 

Second, what does depluralize specifically do for english? Does it just strip s/es? (Since children/child doesn't seem to be included). 

ANSWER


Here is the nitty gritty in english:



 1.  
 2.  If the word is only one letter, do nothing.
 3.  
 4.  If the word ends in "as", "is" or "us", do nothing and return the word.
      * mitosis -> mitosis
      * 
      * veritas -> veritas
      * 
      * syllabus -> syllabus
     
     
 5.  
 6.  If the word ends in "ss", do nothing and return the word.
      * helpless -> helpless
     
     
 7.  
 8.  If the word ends in "sses", change this to "s" and return the stem.
      * bosses -> bos
     
     
 9.  
 10. Similarly, "xes" -> "x"
      * boxes -> box
     
     
 11. 
 12. "zes" -> "z"
      * mazes -> maz
     
     
 13. 
 14. "ches" -> "ch"
      * porches -> porch
     
     
 15. 
 16. "shes" -> "sh"
      * brushes -> brush
     
     
 17. 
 18. "eys" -> "ey"
      * monkeys -> monkey
     
     
 19. 
 20. "ies" -> "y"
      * parties -> party
     
     
 21. 
 22. "s" -> ""
      * rulers -> ruler
      * 
      * boss -> bos
     
     
 23. 



Keep in mind that a stem class is not necessarily what a linguist would define as the "root" of a word and is simply a key used to group words together.



You are correct that "depluralize" is only really effective for english, but we do have a spanish-depluralize and a norwegian-depluralize and would create more given customer demand.



Just to be clear though-- "just does not work" (as you state) does NOT mean "if it sees non-english, it does not make any changes". It will happily remove S from anything it sees. You would need to remove depluralize from the settings if your content was mainly non-english if it was causing strange things.



And children/child is not included since that rule (removing "ren") would have more exceptions (barren -> bar? ) and has fewer words to begin with. I would suggest creating knowledge bases for particular exceptions like this if this was something that bothered a customer.
