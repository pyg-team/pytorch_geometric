PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Suggest the customer installs Cognos application in a separate
   WebSphere Application Server profile; otherwise, there is a
   conflict between the oracle driver jar used by the customer
   application, and the oracle driver jar file included in the
   Cognos .ear file. Even if this is the same driver, Oracle
   doesn't allow you to load classes from different jar files. By
   creating a separate profile for Cognos, the customer will
   isolate it from similar effects from other applications.
