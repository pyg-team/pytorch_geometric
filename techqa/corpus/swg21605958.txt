Title: IBM Is multiple Inspector instances on same web server supported? - United States

Text:
Inspector TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We currently have two test Engine/Hub instances running on the same server with one Web Server. We need to deploy an Inspector instance for each Engine. Is there a way to have multiple Inspector instances running on the same web server and is this a supported configuration? 

CAUSE
The limiting factor in having multiple Inspector (or any of our other web applications) running on the same server is the properties file. You cannot have the same inspector.properties file in the same name space. Changing the properties file name by modifying the war file is not recommended or supported.

ANSWER
The recommended and supported method for having multiple web applications running on the same server is to create multiple web servers (one for each web application of the same type). 

 For example if you need to have two Inspector applications and two Enterprise viewers then you will need to create two web servers. One web server to host one Inspector and one Enterprise Viewer. The second will host the other Inspector and Enterprise viewer. 

This configuration ensures that the properties name and war file do not need to be modified.
