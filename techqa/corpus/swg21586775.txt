Taskmaster Web Verify TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Submit error against trailing or separator page in Taskmaster Web Verify 

SYMPTOM
Message box appears similar to the following when pressing Submit: 

Unable to save data - server error. Writing 'c:\tmperr.txt' for support


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Trailing or separator pages which are generally unintended to be displayed for verification, have no associated data file, and should be hidden from the operator in the majority of cases. These pages can be hidden by updating the STATUS variables in the run-time batch to an appropriate IPS (Ignored Page Statuses) setting as determined by the the task module's BPP or ICP file. See the application development guide (SC1-3251-01) from the IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.0.1 Publication Library for full documentation on Ignored Page Statuses. 

 

Ex: TM000002 is a Trailing_Page type. Setting its STATUS variable to -1 when -1 is within the ICP file's IPS list will cause Taskmaster Web to skip the page.
