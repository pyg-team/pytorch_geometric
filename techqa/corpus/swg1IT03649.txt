ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A CWSXM1051E is seen when attempting to deploy and run a
   mediation that contains a subflow that contains a service
   invoke:
   
   CWSXM1051E: The subflow reference CrewsCJDBCPartner used by
   service invoke primitive invokeGetSequence in mediation flow
   component Med_OnOffDutyNotification_CDM2CREWS in module
   Med_OnOffDutyNotification_CREWS does not have a value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus v7.5 and Business
   Process Manger v7.5 and v8 who make use of subflows in their
   applications where the subflow contains a Service Invoke
   Primitive
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a user attempted to deploy and run their application a
   CWSXM1051E exception was seen in the log and the flow failed to
   build. The exception was caused by the parent flow of the
   subflow not correctly propagating a service reference to a
   Service Invoke Primitive in the subflow.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to ensure that the correct service
   reference is propagated and used in a subflow.
