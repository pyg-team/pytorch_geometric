PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message DFHSO0123 with return code 412 when trying to upgrade your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region and would like to know the meaning of return code 412. 

SYMPTOM
DFHSO0123 Return code 412 received from function 'gsk_secure_socket_init' of System SSL. Reason: Unsupported operation.
DFHWB0732 CWXN CICS Web attach processing encountered a sockets I/O error while receiving a client request.


CAUSE
The 412 means GSK_ERR_UNSUPPORTED. This indicates that Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) V2 is being used. However, it is not supported.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) V1.0 protocol or higher. This requirement is documented in CICS TS documentation under Support for security protocols [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfht5/topics/dfht5kt.html] as follows:


CICSÂ® supports the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols. 

Specifically, CICS supports TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. For more details of these protocols, see the relevant RFC: 

 * TLS 1.0: RFC 2246 
 * TLS 1.1: RFC 4346 
 * TLS 1.2: RFC 5246


Note: The term SSL is used to refer to both the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols in the documentation, except where a specific point about either protocol is required. 

Support for TLS 1.2 was added to CICS TS starting in version 5.1.
