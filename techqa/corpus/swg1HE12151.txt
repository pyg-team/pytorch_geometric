PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No search results are returned from the client's user database
   when searching with Content Collector Search on the Lotus Notes
   search bar because a particular document could not be parsed by
   the Domino Java API. These types of documents will be skipped in
    future.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0.2 LA016 and 4.0.0 Fix
   Pack 3, the problem has been fixed.
   1. Install the fix.
   2. If you do not use the embedded web application server,
   perform the following steps:
       a) Copy the ewas_contentcollectorsearch ear file from the
   transferDirectory subdirectory in the AFUWeb directory on the
   IBM Content Collector server to the target machine where the web
   application server is located.
       b) Remove the Content Collector web applications by running
   the afu_ewas_undeploy script (this script does not delete the
   WAS profile) followed by the afu_ewas_deploy script.
       c) Start the IBM Content Collector Web Application service.
    3. Enable Content Collector Search in the Lotus Notes search
   bar by installing the Content Collector Search plug-in on the
   client machines. For details, see:
