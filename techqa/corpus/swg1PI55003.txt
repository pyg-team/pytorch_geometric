APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using DFDL on a wired output card with XML as WTX output in
   Integration/Message Broker getting error message 'CTDU4001E:
   Root element '<element name>' in namespace '' does not exist.
   
   The WebSphere Transformation Extender map executes normally,
   and on inspection of the input backup, the input DFDL(XML) is
   fine (the map parses it successfully).
   
   The DFDL re-serializer fails to re-map the DFDL back to the XSV
   format:
   
   "( WMB8BRKR.Default ) The DFDL serializer signalled that a
   processing error occurred.
    The message from the DFDL serializer is:
    'CTDU4001E: Root element 'HL7' in namespace '' does not exist.'
    The element being serialized was:
    '/DFDL/HL7'
   
   Processing errors occurred during the serializing of a DFDL
   message tree.
   
   Review and resolve the problems indicated in the message from
   the DFDL serializer by modifying or deleting the specified
   element from the DFDL message tree.  "
