ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RDDs can be used in WPF to specify attributes (name, format,
   grouping, etc) of data elements. In an event GroupDefinitions
   are specifided in the RDD, for example if we have 3 groups with
   elements in them:
   
   Group1
     -data1
     -data2
   Group2
     -data3
     -data4
     -data5
   Group3
     -data6
     -data7
   
   If the above structure is specified in the RDD, the result
   obtained at runtime is as follow:
   
   Group1
     -data1
     -data2
   Group2
     -data4   [NOTICE this is reversed with data3]
     -data3
     -data5
   Group3
     -data7   [NOTICE this is reversed with data6]
     -data6
   
   
   In summary, if the GroupDefinitions are specified in the RDD,
   the ordering of elements in these groups is ignored. If group
   definitions are NOT specified in the RDD, then the ordering of
   elements is respected as per the RDD but no groups are created
   since there is no GroupDefinitions specified in the
   RDD.
