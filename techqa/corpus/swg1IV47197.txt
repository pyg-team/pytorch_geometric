LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Add support for Fault-Tolerant Operation (FTO) environment for
   Tivoli Enterprise Automation Server.
   
   
   The OSLC-PM service provider, contained within the Tivoli
   Enterprise Automation Server (KAS) previously did not work with
   a hub management server configured for Fault-Tolerant Operation
   (FTO).  Now a KAS server can be installed on the primary and
   mirror HUBs and will switch between the two instances based on
   which HUB is primary.  The OSLC-PM will register with a
   configurable alias in Registry Services to abstract the
   hostnames of the two HUB servers.
   
   This configuration requires the Registry Services component of
   Jazz for Service Management v1.1 FixPack 1 or later.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was updated to add the support for FTO.
   
   Install Actions
   
   This configuration requires the Registry Services component of
   Jazz for Service Management v1.1 FixPack 1 or later.
