z/os maintenance RSU put PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 I would like to understand the RSU and PUT maintenance process. 

CONTENT
The RSU (Recommended Service Upgrade) and PUT processes are different but both are related to maintenance. The PUT (Program Update Tape) process is being phased out. 
The CST (Consolidated Service Test) and the RSU information can be found here, you can register in the following link to be notified by email when a new RSU has completed testing:
