Title: IBM OmniFind Enterprise Edition default search portlet does not display results correctly - United States

oee; WCM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have deployed the OmniFind Enterprise Edition default search portlet into WebSphere Portal 6.1.5.1.

The typeahead does not display correctly in the portlet. However, if I try the same test in the OmniFind default search application, the typeahead appears fine.

This only happens when using Internet Explorer 7. It does not happen when using Firefox. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

This is probably occurring because of the specific theme and skin of the portlet getting used.
Check the theme in the Portal administration page. 


The OmniFind portlet works correctly with the "Portal" and "Tab Menu" themes.

First check that the search results appear correct when using one of these two themes.
Then, begin debugging your own custom portlet further to see why it may differ.
