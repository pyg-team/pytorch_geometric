local data directories; Temp TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can you delete the directories in the Rational DOORS temp area with the prefix "LD_" ? 

CAUSE
There are a number of directories in the local data area; some of these are empty, other contain subdirectories or files.

ANSWER
Never remove any temporary files or directories when the DOORS client is running. As long as there is no DOORS client running, these directories are safe for deletion.


Rational DOORS uses a local data area for temporary file storage and use. These directories and files are created and used during a DOORS client session.


Below is a sample directory list tree:
