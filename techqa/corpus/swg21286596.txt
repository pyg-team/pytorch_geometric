QUESTION
 This technote explains the difference of license mechanism happening between temporary and permanent licenses for IBM® Rational® Software Architect, IBM® Rational® Application Developer, IBM® Rational® Software Modeler or IBM® Rational® Systems Developer v 7.0.x 

CAUSE
 

After starting two workspaces from the same machine/user pointing to a license server that contains
temporary license for RSA, the lmstat output using the following command:


 * <rational_install_dir>\common\lmutil lmstat /all
 * OR 
 * <rational_install_dir>\common\lmutil lmstat -f ibmrad 


will display: 
 * Feature usage info:
   Users of ibmrsa: (Total of 2 licenses issued; Total of 2 licenses in use)
   
   "ibmrsa" v7.00000, vendor: ibmratl
   floating license
   
   user ClientMachine JavaDisplay (v7.00) (ServerMachine/27000 201), start Tue 10/30 7:05
   user ClientMachine JavaDisplay (v7.00) (ServerMachine/27000 101), start Tue 10/30 7:044
   


As you can see, the user is consuming two licenses although he/she uses the same machine. 
ANSWER
By design, the temporary licenses do not make use of the FlexLM DUP_GROUP feature as described below: 

 

DUP_GROUP=... Duplicate grouping parameter can be specified in the license in FLEXlm v4.0 and later. 
The syntax is: DUP_GROUP=NONE|SITE|[UHDV] 
U = DUP_USER 
H = DUP_HOST 
D = DUP_DISPLAY 
V = DUP_VENDOR_DEF 

Any combination of UHDV is allowed, and the DUP_MASK is the OR of the combination. For example, DUP_GROUP=UHD means the duplicate grouping is (DUP_USER|DUP_HOST|DUP_DISPLAY), so for a user on the same host and display, additional uses of a feature do not consume additional licenses. 
The permanent licenses do not have such problems as they make use of the DUP_GROUP feature. 

The same lmstat command: <rational_install_dir>\common\lmutil lmstat /all 
with a permanent license starting 2 workspaces from the same machine/user will give the following output: 
 * ]Feature usage info: Users of ibmrsa: (Total of 2 licenses issued; Total of 1 license in use) "ibmrsa" v7.00000, vendor: ibmratl floating license user ClientMachine JavaDisplay (v7.00) (ServerMachine/27000 101), start Tue 10/30 7:06 [
