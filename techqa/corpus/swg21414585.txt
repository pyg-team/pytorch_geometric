Text:
1414585; RQM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote describes the possible causes and solutions of the requirement import failure from IBM RequisitePro into IBM Rational Quality Manager. 

SYMPTOM
After imports start, some requirements are brought in Rational Quality Manager from RequisitePro, but the importing stops. The Rational Quality Manager log indicates there is time-out on RequisitePro during import. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reset the following ReqWeb settings following the instructions: 

 1. Stop the ReqWeb services  1. Go to the control Panel -> Administrative tools ->Services 
     2. Stop the services:  1. IBM HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC 
         2. IBM WebSphere Application Server V 6.1 - RWP ReqWeb Servlet
            
        
        
    
    
 2. Increase the time-out of the RQProxies:  1. Go to the config.txt path:
        
        C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\profiles\profile2\installedApps\DefaultNode\ReqWeb.ear\ReqWeb.war\WEB-INF\classes
        
     2. Modify the content of the config.txt adding the RPXTimeOut at the RPX Server section.
        
     3. Open the config.txt on a text editor an look for the [RPX Server] section, at the end of that section add RPXTimeOut=60; where 60 represents the number of minutes that the RQProxy will be active. 
        
        The valid range is from to 60, others values will default to 20.
    
    

The original file contains: 

 

 


[RPX Server]
' The path to the project catalog file that is used to locate RequisitePro
' projects.
' To use the default catalog location, leave this field blank.
RPXCatalog=C:\PROGRA~1\IBM\RATION~1\REQUIS~1\ReqWeb\projects\Catalog.txt

' The following configures the method and authentication used to launch the
' RequisitePro Extensibility Interface (RPX), which RequisiteWeb uses to
' access project data. We do not recommend changing the following settings
' without specific instructions from Rational technical support or product
' documentation. By default, RequisiteWeb launches the RPX inside RqProxy.exe.
' The default values are as follows:
' Install Type=2
' User ID=
' Password=
' Server Name=
' Domain=
Install Type=2
User ID=
Password=
Server Name=
Domain=
The modified file should look like these (setting the time-out to 60 minutes): 

 

 


[RPX Server]
' The path to the project catalog file that is used to locate RequisitePro ' projects. 

' To use the default catalog location, leave this field blank. 

RPXCatalog=C:\PROGRA~1\IBM\RATION~1\REQUIS~1\ReqWeb\projects\Catalog.txt 

 

' The following configures the method and authentication used to launch the 

' RequisitePro Extensibility Interface (RPX), which RequisiteWeb uses to 

' access project data. We do not recommend changing the following settings 

' without specific instructions from Rational technical support or product 

' documentation. By default, RequisiteWeb launches the RPX inside RqProxy.exe. 

' The default values are as follows:

' User ID=

' Server Name= 

' Domain= 

Install Type=2 

User ID= 

Password= 

Server Name= 

Domain= 

RPXTimeOut=60; 




Save the file and close it. 

 

 

C. Increase the web session time-out: 

 *  Go to the web.xml path for ReqPro 7.1.x:
   
   C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\profiles\profile2\config\cells\DefaultNode\applications\
   ReqWeb.ear\deployments\ReqWeb\ReqWeb.war\WEB-INF
   Modify the content of the web.xml to change the web session time-out. Open the file web.xml on a text editor an look for the tags called <session-config> and <session-timeout>. Change the value from default 20 minutes to 120. 
   
   This will set a web session to take 2 hours to expire. 

The original file contains: 

 


</servlet-mapping>
<servlet-mapping>  <servlet-name>_ibmjsp._Login_5F_Ctl</servlet-name> 

 <url-pattern>/Login_Ctl.jsp</url-pattern> 

 </servlet-mapping> 

<session-config> 

<session-timeout>20</session-timeout> 

</session-config> 

<welcome-file-list> 

<welcome-file>Login_Page.jsp</welcome-file> 

<welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file> 

</welcome-file-list>


The modified file should look like this: 

 


</servlet-mapping>
<servlet-mapping>  <servlet-name>_ibmjsp._Login_5F_Ctl</servlet-name> 

 <url-pattern>/Login_Ctl.jsp</url-pattern> 

 </servlet-mapping> 

<session-config> 

<session-timeout>120</session-timeout> 

</session-config> 

<welcome-file-list> 

<welcome-file>Login_Page.jsp</welcome-file> 

<welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file> 

</welcome-file-list>


Save the file and close it. 

 

D. Start the ReqWeb services again 

 1. Go to the control Panel -> Administrative tools ->Services
    
 2. Start the services  1. IBM HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC 
     2. IBM WebSphere Application Server V 6.1 - RWP ReqWeb Servlet
    
    
 3. Make sure both services are started again.


 

E. To make sure a clean start, and no RqProxy processes are running, after doing above updates, reboot the ReqWeb Windows machine.
