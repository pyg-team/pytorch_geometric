PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you migrate from WebSphere Lombardi Edition 7.2.0 Fix Pack 4 to IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5, you receive the following validation error: 'There are multiple variables with the search alias "MySearchAlias". Search alias must be unique across parent process and subprocess.' 

SYMPTOM
After a successful migration from WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0 Fix Pack 4 to IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5 you see validation errors. The errors state that multiple variables with the same search aliases exist. The search alias must be unique across the parent process and subprocess.


CAUSE
The root cause for this issue is APAR IC81926 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC81926], which involves an orphaned search alias after renaming a variable.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To verify that this issue exists in your environment, determine if variable names changed in your WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2 environment. If variables changed, determine whether the interim fix for APAR IC81926 was installed on your V7.2.0 Fix Pack 4 environment before the migration process took place. If the interim fix was not installed, see the steps that are described in the "Resolving the problem" section.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two known solutions to this problem.




 * Solution 1:  1. In the WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2 authoring environment, open the business process definition (BPD) with the validation errors.
       
       
    2. Rename the variables that have validation errors to its original name. 
       
       
    3. Add and remove the search alias using the alias it had prior to the rename process in step 2.
       
       
    4. Rename the variable back to the desired name. 
       
       
    5. Re-add the search alias. 
       
       
   
   
 * Solution 2:  1. Create a copy of the export file and rename the export file name to exportName.zip. 
       
       
    2. Extract the export and edit the XML file for the BPD with the validation errors. 
       
       
    3. Remove the orphaned search aliases from the XML file. The XML code will be similar to the following code.
       
       
       Note: tw.local.Test2 is the old variable name in this example.
       
       
       <searchableField id="bpdid:6efc294f163c7f46:599952b9:135bf7ae05c:-7fe4">
       <name>Test2</name> 
       <type>2</type> 
       <expression id="bpdid:e69a167960e47937:24d2f9b6:135ad97f230:-7ee2">
       <expression>tw.local.Test2</expression> 
       </expression>
       </searchableField> 
       
       
    4. Save the XML file.
       
       
    5. Recompress the exported files.
       
       
    6. Rename the compressed file to exportName.twx
   
   
   
   
   When you import the exported file into the later product version, the validation should not find the orphaned aliases and the error should not occur.
