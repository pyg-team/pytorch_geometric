APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ v5.3.1.10 and higher on HP-NSS (HP Non-Stop) have added
   support for TLS 1.2 cipherspecs for queue managers, but MQ
   Explorer does not show these as options or allow setting them
   on the channel cipherspec setting.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use runmqsc command to alter channels to set TLS 1.2
   cipherspecs for HP-NSS queue managers upgraded to 5.3.1.10 or
   higher.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the IBM MQ Explorer attempting to connect to a
   5.3.1.10 queue manager on HP-NSS.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows, Linux on zSeries, Linux on x86-64, Linux on x86, Linux
   on Power
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   IBM WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server 5.3.1.10 added support
   for the following cipherspecs:
   
   DES_SHA_EXPORT1024
   RC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
   ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
   ECDHE_RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
   ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
   ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   ECDHE_RSA_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   
   However the MQ configuration was not modified to understand that
   these cipherspecs are now available when connected to an HP-NSS
   queue manager, and so these options were not available when
   attempting to select a cipherspec for a queue manager or
   channel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ Explorer configuration has been modified so that the
   cipherspecs above are now available for selection when connected
   to a queue manager running on the HP-NSS platform.
   
   The IBM MQ Explorer cannot differentiate between a queue manager
   at 5.3.1.10 and earlier 5.3 versions, therefore these options
   will be available even where 5.3.1.10 has not been applied. If
   an attempt is made to select a cipherspec not valid on that
   release error AMQ4635 will be thrown.
