Title: IBM The rendering of complex coaches in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) might be slow with Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 8.0 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The rendering of complex coaches (tasks) in Process Portal applications of IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0 might be significantly slower with Internet Explorer Version 8.0 compared to other browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. 

SYMPTOM
Some customers are reporting slow and unsatisfactory performance when using Microsoft Internet Explorer V8 to load coaches as part of their IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.x / V8.x applications. 

Details:


 * Users of Internet Explorer V8 have experienced known performance issues with Java™Script rendering. When coaches make heavy use of JavaScript, it manifests in slow coach rendering behavior. This issue involves the design of Internet Explorer V8 rather than the design of IBM Business Process Manager coaches. 
 * Performance degradation has also been observed in human services that contain a Table control Coach View or a Tab control Coach View. The degradation is caused by the capability of the browser to handle Ajax and the related scripting that is required by the controls (IBM Business Process Manager interim fixes are available on Fix Central). 
 * You see a message that is similar to the following text from Internet Explorer 8.0 when JavaScript is taking too long to complete:
   Stop running this script?
   A script on this page is causing Internet Explorer to run slowly.
   If it continues to run, your computer might become unresponsive.
   

In general, the more complex and extensive the coach implementations are, the longer it takes for a web browser to load them, with Internet Explorer V8 showing the slowest performance. CAUSE
For good performance, IBM Business Process Manager coaches require a more recent browser to handle JavaScript, Ajax and other Web 2.0 technologies that are being used.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The first step in improving application performance related to web browsers, regardless of the specific browser being used, is to make sure that you have optimized your web browser and HTTP server settings. Especially for Internet Explorer V8, as well as for Internet Explorer V9, it is recommended that you change to some of the browser default settings, as described in the IBM Business Process Manager V8.0 Performance Tuning and Best Practices [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4935.html] redpaper (REDP-4935-00). 


Here are some additional recommendations:


 * Verify that Internet Explorer V8 or V9 cache settings are specified as "automatic." More detail about the caching mechanism is available in the Caching Improvements in Internet Explorer 9 [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/07/14/caching-improvements-in-internet-explorer-9.aspx] document on the MSDN blog.
   
   
 * Verify that the Internet Explorer V8 or V9 cache size is at least 50 MB. In some installations, the cache size might need to be 250 MB.
   
   
 * Verify the maximum concurrent connections from Internet Explorer V8 or V9 browser to the server. The default is 6. This default value means that only 6 requests to the server can be done concurrently. Using an HTTP request trace tool such as Fiddler or HTTPWatch, you can see that files are downloaded in groups of 6. In a slow or remote network, it helps if the limit is increased, for example, to 10. (This change is done through the registry. For Internet Explorer V8 or V9, the description of how to make this change is described in the AJAX - Connectivity Enhancements in Windows Internet Explorer 8 [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc304129%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#changing_max] topic.)
   
   
 * Verify the HTTP server tuning, as discussed in Section 4.12 of the REDP-4935-00 redpaper. 


Additional information on increasing the performance of any specific web browser are available from the vendor website for that specific web browser. 

Optionally, to improve coach performance with a web browser, you can do either or both of the following two actions: 

Option 1. Upgrade to a more recent browser 

Upgrade to a newer browser, such as Internet Explorer V9 or V10, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. All are faster than Internet Explorer V8. The following browser performance reports are available for comparing web browsers capabilities:  * The BIG browser benchmark (January 2013 edition) [http://www.zdnet.com/the-big-browser-benchmark-january-2013-edition-7000009776/] 
 * Web Browser Grand Prix: Chrome 18, Firefox 11, Windows XP (April 2012 edition) [http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-xp-web-browser-performance,3167-7.html] 
 * Browser javascript speed comparison – IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera (April 2010 edition) [http://blog.actuanceconsulting.com/browser-javascript-speed-comparison/] 


If the corporate IT strategy for an organization is to use Internet Explorer V8 overall, consider making an exception for users of IBM Business Process Manager applications to use a different browser. 

If you must use Internet Explorer V8, use the Profiler tool to evaluate the performance of the JavaScript that is used in the coaches. This tool comes with Internet Explorer. It can identify costly JavaScript calls and help determine whether the calls can be replaced or minimized. 

Option 2. Optimize coach / coach view implementations 

In general, reducing the complexity and functionality of each coach view implementation increases the overall performance no matter what web browser is used. Therefore, from the very beginning of a Business Process Manager project, end-user use cases should be evaluated to provide everything the user is expecting with respect to the GUI, but with minimal overhead. What is not required from a user perspective should not be part of a coach, a coach view, or a coach control implementation. 

A more recent browser that is capable of handling JavaScript, Ajax and other Web 2.0 technologies should be used even if coach implementations are optimized with known best practices. The following recommendations will have the biggest positive impact when running the coaches on Internet Explorer V8, but are also valid considerations for more recent web browsers as well: 
 * When composing a coach, reduce the number of coach view templates and coach view instances used and reduce the number of coach view nesting levels. 
 * When loading a coach, consider lazy loading of data, which means only retrieving the data that is presented to the user immediately. Reload additional data only if the user requests it. 
 * In cases where the stock coach views that are provided by IBM Business Process Manager include more functionality than is required by your project, consider creating lightweight controls with a subset of the capability. For example, if you do not require bidi and RTL support in a Text control, create a lightweight version without that capability. Or, instead of using the full sortable/editable Table coach view, create a lightweight custom table control coach view using custom HTML. These approaches reduce the loading times for controls. 
 * If the Business Process Manager project makes use of the stock controls, especially the table and tab stock controls, consider the following approaches:  * Instead of using the table stock control coach view, use horizontal sections that are arranged to resemble a table grid. 
    * Instead of using table stock controls, create custom lightweight coach views for individual columns. 
    * Separate tabbed content onto multiple coaches. 
    * Install the available interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634799] to increase the performance of the table and tab stock control. Note: These fixes do not help when you use custom stock controls.
