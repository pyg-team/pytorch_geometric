VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Vulnerability Details 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]


DESCRIPTION:The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

Note: For Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 4.1.x for Linux, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported release of the product. How to apply apply the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center interim fixes for CVE-2015-0235 (APAR IT06917 or APAR IT06919) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696364] 

Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc, including your Operating Systems, and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If you cannot apply the fix provided, you can mitigate exposure with the following actions in Tivoli Storage Productivity Center:
