APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are unable to add recipients to a hold notice that belongs
   to a request other than the one the notice was for, using the
   Add > People in Scope page.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use Add Employees and search for employees to add.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  For hold notice, add people in scope from another request than
   the hold notice's request does not work.  Selections from other
   requests are ignored.  For example, in hold notice > rules tab
   > recipients button > Add People In Scope, clear the filter,
   select user from another request, and save.  Nothing happens.
   This issue was introduced in V6.0.3.0.
   If you add users to a hold notice using Add People In Scope,
   you do not use the default filter, and selections are not
   added, then this is most likely your issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available now from Fix Central as a part of 6.0.3,
   iFix001.
