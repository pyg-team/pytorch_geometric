PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to use the LPEX editor to print line numbers in both .java and .xml files in WebSphere® Studio Application Developer (WSAD) version 5.1.2 and Rational® Application Developer (RAD) version 6.x. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can use the LPEX editor in both WSAD 5.1.2 and in RAD 6.x to print line numbers in .java and .xml files. However, the Basic LPEX editor is not shown as an available editor for WSAD when you right click on a file. To associate the LPEX editor with file formats including .java and others and then print those files with line numbers, you can use the workaround given below. 

(Note: This information is provided as workaround information only, and any issues encountered are not supported.) 


 1. Go to where you have WSAD 5.1.2 installed, locate the LPEX plugin and edit the file, plugin.xml, as in this example: 
    E:\WSADv512\eclipse\plugins\com.ibm.lpex_1.4.6\plugin.xml
    
 2. Uncomment the lines at the end of the file by removing the comment tags (<!-- and -->) as shown on the first and last lines of this example: 
    
    <!-- 
    <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.editors"> 
    <editor 
    id="com.ibm.lpex.alef.LpexTextEditor" 
    name="My LPEX Editor" 
    icon="icons/basic/obj16/editor_obj.gif" 
    class="com.ibm.lpex.alef.LpexTextEditor" 
    extensions="app,asm,c,c++,cbl,cc,ccs,cicsc,cmd,cob,cpp,cpy,
    cxx,f,f90,f95,h,h++,hh,hla,hpp,htm,html,hxx,inc,inl,j,jav,
    java,jcl,jj,lx,lxl,lxu,mac,pli,pro,properties,rc,readme,rex,
    rexx,sqc,sql,sqlc,sqlj,txt,xml,xsl"
    contributorClass="com.ibm.lpex.alef.LpexContextContributor">
    </editor> 
    </extension>
    --> 
    
    
 3. After making the above change in WSAD (or in RAD), when you restart WSAD or RAD, right click on a file (with one of above mentioned extensions) and select Open With > Basic LPEX Editor. 
 4. Change the print preference for LPEX editor in Windows > Preferences > LPEX editor to print the file with line numbers. (This function is the same for both RAD version 6.0.x and WSAD version 5.1.2)
