 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
During installation of CF08, the following exception is seen in SystemOut.log 

[11/19/13 11:45:18:247 EST] 0000000a SystemOut O FileNotFoundException. 
[11/19/13 11:45:18:247 EST] 0000000a SystemOut O obj_ii == null when read entity.
[11/19/13 11:45:18:251 EST] 0000000a SystemOut O History file not found: /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/V8/Server/version/histories/IBM WebSphere Portal Server V8/history.xml
[11/19/13 11:45:18:251 EST] 0000000a SystemOut O obj_hi == null when read entity.
[11/19/13 11:45:18:265 EST] 0000000a ProductServic W com.ibm.wps.services.product.ProductServiceImpl init EJPFD0050W: An exception occurred while checking installation history, no information about interim fixes and fix packs is available!
com.ibm.websphere.product.IMVersionHelper$IMVersionHelperException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/V8/Server/version/installed.xml (A file or directory in the path name does not exist.)
at com.ibm.websphere.product.IMVersionHelper.getIMInstallInfo(IMVersionHelper.java:130)


CAUSE
The reason for this behavior is that the location of the installed.xml and history.xml files changed in CF08 and the change is registered with Portal before the files are copied. 


Subsequent server starts will not display the exception as the files will be read from the updated location.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This exception will not cause problems with Portal functionality and can be ignored. 


The reason for the null values are because the values in wps.properties files are used to locate the installed.xml and history.xml files. 

As a workaround, one could adjust the im.appDataLocation values in /PortalServer/wps.properties and wp_profile/PortalServer/wps.properties files to point to the correct IIM location.

For example: 

Unix: <username>/var/ibm/InstallationManager
Windows: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager
