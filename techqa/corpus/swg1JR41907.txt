APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When accessing metadata about a SCA component, SPI provides for
   components with two or more interfaces no data about these
   interfaces. Signature indicates always only one interface can be
   returned, therefore a second signature is needed that is capable
   of returning multiple interfaces.
