 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What license types and license keys are available for IBM Rational Policy Tester version 8.5 and how are they installed? 

ANSWER


 

HOW TO OBTAIN LICENSES 


Policy Tester uses the Rational Common Licensing system. You obtain the licenses at the License Key Center (LKC) [https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login], as described in this video How to acquire licenses from License Key Center [https://youtu.be/qXFK_es2uTk] or in How to generate license keys at License Key Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665366]. 

Note: You do NOT receive licenses for the Policy Tester product you have purchased from your IBM Sales representative or from Policy Tester Support (with some exceptions for evaluation licenses). Instead, you or the primary contact with IBM at your company obtains the licenses from LKC as described above. 



LICENSE KEYS NEEDED 


To install and run Policy Tester you need licenses for: 

 * Policy Tester installation 
 * Dynamic Analysis Scanner installations 
 * Console users (for users to login into Policy Tester Console)
   



LICENSE KEYS IN DETAILS 


Licenses for Policy Tester installation 

There are three licenses for Policy Tester installation: PolicyTesterAcc or PolicyTesterPrv or PolicyTesterQty. You need only one of them, and you need only one (1) key of the license for one installation of Policy Tester.  


Licenses for Dynamic Analysis Scanner installation 

There is only one license for Dynamic Analysis Scanner installation, it is PolicyTesterScanner. The number of keys of this license will allow you to install the same number of Dynamic Analysis Scanners, for example, if you have three keys of this license you can install three Dynamic Analysis Scanners of three different machines. 



Licenses for (Policy Tester) Console Users 

There are two different types of licenses for users who logs into the Policy Tester Console: Authorized User or Floating User. 

 

 * Floating User Licenses
   
   If you have Floating User licenses, then at any time you can have as many users logged into the Policy Tester Console as you have Floating User license keys. Floating User licenses are not tied to specific users, and are released as soon as a user logs out (the user must log out using the "Log Out" function to release the license; closing the browser will not release the license until two hours have passed). 
   
   The Floating user licence for Policy Tester is named PolicyTesterFLT. 
 * Authorized User Licenses
   
   If you have Authorized User licenses, only the users that you authorize (users that you specify in "Administration > Users and Groups") will be able to log in. If no users are logged into the Console, and an unauthorized user attempts to log in, they will be denied. 
   
   If you have a new installation, and (for example) 5 Authorized User Licenses, by default the first 5 users to log in to instance will be automatically authorized to the license, and if any other user attempts to log in, they will be denied. 
   
   To have a different user to log in when all of the Authorized User licenses are consumed, the Administrator must first remove the license from on of the Authorized Users. They can do it on the "Administration > Users and Groups" page of the Enterprise Console. 
   
   The Authorized user licence for Policy Tester is named: PolicyTesterAU 
   
   Note: The Authorized User license key is displayed incorrectly as Floating license type in the License Key Administrator. 


Usage of mixed types of user licenses 

If you have both Floating User and Authorized User licenses, when a user logs into the instance they will consume what ever license the Default User is set to use. 

The type of license the Default User consumes can be changed by an Administrator by going to "Administration -> Users and Groups" of the Enterprise Console. 

Note: The Product Administrator and Service Accounts (specified in the Configuration Wizards) do not consume a user license. Only one Product Administrator is allowed (you can have several Administrators, but only one "Product Administrator"). 






HOW TO APPLY THE LICENSES 

Load the generated license file at License Key Center into the License Key Server as described in: How to import AppScan license keys into License Key Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698524]

 * Load the license keys into the License Key Server (as described in: How to import AppScan license keys into License Key Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698524]).



3. MOVING LICENSE KEY SERVER TO ANOTHER MACHINE 
 * Move the License Server and the license keys as described in: How to transfer License Key Server or license keys [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686972] 
 * Point Policy Tester to the new License Key Server by running the Configuration Wizard. 


4. MOVING POLICY TESTER TO ANOTHER MACHINE 
 * If the License Key Server is going to be moved as well, then refer to scenario #3 for moving the License Key Server.
