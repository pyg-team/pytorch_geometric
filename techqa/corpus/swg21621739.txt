Title: IBM Why cannot IBM Content Analytics detect the code page correctly? - United States

QUESTION
 I use IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search (ICAwES).
I use Windows File System crawler whose automatic code page detection is enabled in order to crawl Shift-JIS encoded documents.
Sometimes the crawler detects the code page incorrectly when the documents contain several characters only, as a result, the summary is garbled.
Why cannot ICAwES detect the code page correctly? 

CAUSE
Automatic code page detection is not exact science but heuristic process. Therefore there is no exact rules to detect as Shift_JIS.

ANSWER
Generally, the more characters with natural language the document has, the more correctly ICAwES can detect the code page. 

In addition, for instance, in case of Shit_JIS, the byte sequence '81 42' (Ideographic Full Stop in hex code) helps ICAwES to detect the code page more accurately.

If you do not have any tolerance of such mis-detection, consider applying either of the work around(s) below.


 * Disable automatic code page detection and specify Shift_JIS explicitly if all documents are Shift-JIS encoded. 
 * Make sure that all documents are UTF-8 encoded.
