APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a user omits the "https" part in the URL or third party
   websites links to the site using the "http" scheme instead of
   "https", this could result in an initial connection to a
   HTTPS-enabled site over an unencrypted channel. An attacker can
   hijack this unencrypted channel and replace the intended use of
   HTTPS protocol with HTTP in an attack known as SSLStrip,
   granting unauthorized access.
   
   Websites often transfer non-sensitive resources such as help
   documents over an unencrypted HTTP connection. Any cookies
   without a secure flag are sent along with such requests
   potentially disclosing sensitive user and session data to
   eavesdropper.
   
   It has been observed that Strict Transport Security is not set
   in the response header.
