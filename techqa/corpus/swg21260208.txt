QUESTION
Where can you find the Web Server Plugin for use with a Lotus速 Domino速 server?

ANSWER
Beginning with the Domino 8 server, the Web Server Plugins for IBM速 WebSphere速 Application server no longer ships with the Domino plugins file kit (the plugin-cfg.xml and iisWASPlugin_http.dll files).

To obtain the latest releases of these 2 Web Server Plugin files for WebSphere Application server, please refer to the WebSphere Trials and demos download [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?go=y&rs=wspwas&S_TACT=105AGX28&S_CMP=DLMAIN] site and the Latest fix packs for WebSphere Application Server [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27009661].

Please note that you will need to sign in with your universal IBM user ID to obtain these files. If you do not have a universal IBM user ID, you will need to first register with the website to create one.
