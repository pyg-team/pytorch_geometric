 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error Installing SPSS Data Access Pack

1: The InstallScript engine is missing from this machine. If Available, please run ISScript.msi, or contact your support personnel for further assistance.

Attempting to install the data access pack to allow Modeller 14 to connect to Oracle database.

1. Downloaded the data access pack (SDAPWin32_6.0.3.exe) from the SPSS site
2. Attempted to install.
3. Package extracts but install fails

The SPSS drivers are compiled using InstallSheild v8 which comes included the package. There is some issue with my machine which keeps using installsheild v11.5.

We can't stop installsheild v11.5 from running. We have followed all advice from http://consumer.installshield.com/ [http://consumer.installshield.com/]. 

Is there any alternative way to install the DataAccess Pack - we need the Oracle 5.3 Drivers. Is there a way to get a version of the Access Pack complied using Installsheild version 11.5? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check your Active Directory Policy to verify if it automatically applies a different version of InstallSheild. 

Attempting to uninstall installsheild and apply Version 8 from the Data Access package was prevented by a registry key pointing to a different version of installsheild that would re-apply version 11.5 from the network.

The workaround to the issue is to have the Network Administrator export the registry key and then delete it. This should allow an install of version 8 and then the SPSS data access pack.
