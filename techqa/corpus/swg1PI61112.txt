APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and the  Statistics 24
   Custom Dialog Builder Interim Fix 001 from fixcentral
   http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]
   Launch release 24 after installation of the IF001
   Click Extensions -  Install Local Extension Bundle and locate a
   self-created custom dialog *.spe file.
   Click open and you are informed that the Dialog self-created
   custom dialog was successfully  installed to menu Custom > <your
   dialog name>
   Restart Statistics 24 and see on which menu the dialog is
   installed to
   
   You notice:
   The menu location for the dialog is wrong. It is installed to
   Extensions menu instead to a menu CUSTOM as defined on the spe
   file.
   If you open the *.spe file from Customer in release 24 with
   Extensions - Custom dialog Builder for Extensions you see that
   the menu location for this dialog was set to a menu CUSTOM
   between GRAPHS and UTILITIES menu BUT in fact it is installed to
   EXTENSIONS  menu
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   https://www.ibm.com/software/analytics/support/fixes/pbi_schedul
   e.html [https://www.ibm.com/software/analytics/support/fixes/pbi_schedule.html] for information on upcoming Fix Packs
   If you encounter the issue described above and it is not
   possible for you to wait for the next FixPack please open a
   Service Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed to address the issue.
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI61112
   and technote 1982551 about about Interim Fix 002 for IBM SPSS
   Statistics 24.0.0.0.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
   PLEASE NOTE: The fix will only apply to NEW CDBs. For existing
   CDB that show the issue the user will need to:
   1) Open the SPE file
   2) open the menu editor dialog
   3) Hit OK
   4) Save\Save As the dialog.
   Now if you install this dialog it will install to the Custom
   menu.
   There is no other way to fix the existing CDBs as there is an
   error in how they saved to the Custom location.
