Title: IBM Support for virtualization technologies - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The purpose of this technote is to clarify the support to be provided when IBM WebSphere Application Server is running in a Virtualized Environment that is not explicly supported. For the complete listing of the officially supported Virtualized Environments, please see the Virtualization Policy Product Matrix contained in the following support statement:

Virtualization Policy for IBM Software:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Virtualization technology provides transparency to the operating systems, middleware, and applications that operate on top of it. Virtualization allows a single physical machine to be partitioned into multiple physical or logical partitions with each partition providing the look and feel of an independent operating system. Each partition is called a Virtual Machine or Virtual Environment. 
Each Virtual Environment represents a complete system, with processors, memory, networking, and other system resources. Examples of some virtualization technologies include VMware, AIX DLPARs, KVM, XEN, Sun Solaris Zones, HP Virtual Machines, etc.

IBM Support for virtualization
If you submit a standard usage or defect-related service request and WebSphere Application Server is running in a Virtual Environment that is not officially supported, IBM WebSphere Application Server Support will make reasonable efforts to resolve the problem. We will assume the issue is common to both native and virtual operating environments. If we suspect that a problem is the result of the virtualization technology, it may be necessary to recreate the issue in a native environment before providing continued defect support. This will guide subsequent ownership of the problem for further troubleshooting. WebSphere Application Server Support will not provide support or assistance with the set up and/or configuration of Virtual Environments. Customers looking for support setting up Virtual Environments should consult their respective vendors.

Performance
Partitioning hardware into multiple virtual servers could have a dramatic affect on performance. WebSphere Application Server is sensitive to processor caching and overall memory constraints. Virtualization may make resource availability unpredictable. Therefore, WebSphere Application Server Support can make no guarantees with respect to performance or scalability in a Virtualized Environment. We support that our product installs successfully in the Virtual Environment and runs without losing functionality or significant performance.

Caveat
Kernel-sensitive modules and device drivers may not supported on Virtual Environments. For example, WebSphere Application Developer Network Deployment Load Balancer has specific requirements regarding network topology and host integration. It is sensitive to the virtualization model used by the various Virtual Environments.

Therefore, please ensure that the product you intend to use is supported by the vendor for use in a certain type of Virtual Environment.
