Text:
RFE TFIM FIM PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Requests for new features or enhancements to the Federated Identity Manager product. 

CONTENT
The Federated Identity Manager product team has joined all other IBM Security products in the Security Systems RFE (Request for Enhancement) Community. [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/?BRAND ID=301] 

The RFE Community is simple to use. Access to the RFE Community is open to any IBM customer with an IBM ID. 

Federated Identity Manager customers are encouraged to use the Federated Identity Manager RFE (Request for Enhancement) Community. [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/?PROD_ID=246] 

RFEs are your way to tell the Federated Identity Manager team what features you would like to see in Federated Identity Manager.

With the Federated Identity Manager RFE Community you can collaborate with Federated Identity Manager development team and other product users through your ability to search, view, comment on, submit, and track RFEs.

Once a request is submitted, the Federated Identity Manager product team will review the request and provide status as a decision is made on the request. By default, each request is created as private, which means a customer can only see the requests they have submitted.

Before you submit a new request, please view requests that have already been submitted. If your idea has already been submitted, you can add comments to the existing request, thereby indicating your agreement with the idea. We may use this information to help prioritize development of new features. 

The RFE Community portal is intended for enhancement requests only. That is, it is limited to those cases where it is clear that the product is working as designed, but additional functionality is desired. It is not intended as a substitute for troubleshooting product issues or creating / submitting defects.
