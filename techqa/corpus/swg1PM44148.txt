APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the release builder is executed against XMLAccess export
   scripts for a virtual portal, the resulting script contains
   <url-mapping> items which might not be processed on the
   production system. Because the object ID of the virtual portal
   root cannot be pre-determined, the object ID of the root
   url-mapping should be ignored by the release builder.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the release builder is executed against XMLAccess export
   scripts for a virtual portal, the resulting script contains
   <url-mapping> items which might not be processed on the
   production system. Because the object ID of the virtual portal
   root cannot be pre-determined, the object ID of the root
   url-mapping should be ignored by the release builder.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ignores "objectid" value for <url-mapping> items that are the
   context root of a virtual portal.
