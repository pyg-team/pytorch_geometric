 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does BRMS only use one tape drive for a restore when a serial-parallel save was done? 

CAUSE
Design of BRMS restore process 

ANSWER
When a serial-parallel save is done with BRMS, a media definition representing the data saved and the volumes it spans is not created and is not needed for recovery when a serial-parallel save is done. For this reason, the various libraries and other objects saved in this manner are not mapped to multiple tape drives as data saved in a true parallel save would be. The following link provides a method for setting up batch jobs to accomplish concurrent restores of groups of data that were saved in a serial-parallel type of save:
