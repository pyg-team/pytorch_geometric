 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Will the Macintosh Screen Reader VocieOver work with the Statistics application? I am using PASW Statistics v. 18.x and Mac OS X.X. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As noted in our HELP: 

PASW Statistics has been tested only with the JAWS screen reader software on Windows and VoiceOver on the Mac.

According to a customer who has been testing out the Mac version of SPSS with the VoiceOver screen reader:

I can access all the menus, which is great.

I can't access the data itself. VoiceOver does not read as I navigate through it. However, I think this will be solved by using a braille display, and Mac's braille software Louis (I will keep you posted on compatibility between SPSS and Louis) in conjunction with the screen reader.

The output tables aren't initially accessible, but once exported as a pdf, VoiceOver has no problems reading through it.

I haven't tried any graphical outputs, as it won't be necessary for my class. That said, in theory they may be printed as tactile graphics on a high quality braille printer. (I don't have immediate access to one, or I would try it)

Also, something that may work with some of the graphical outputs is data sonification. I might try this out just for kicks.

The Mac keyboard shortcuts don't work in SPSS, but this is common in programs that aren't created initially for Mac, and is no big deal because all the same things can be done through the readable menus.

Note that the braille display allows the best interaction between the Statistics applicaiton and VoiceOver on the Mac
