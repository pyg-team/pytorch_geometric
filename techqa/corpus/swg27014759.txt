CONTENT
 

Please read first [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014759&amp;aid=1]  * WebSphere MQ for z/VSE V3.0 is the follow-on release to MQSeries for VSE/ESA V2.1.2. 

Hardware requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014759&amp;aid=1]  * IBM System z10 Enterprise Class 
 * IBM System z10 Business Class 
 * IBM System z9 Enterprise Class 
 * IBM System z9 Business Class 
 * IBM zSeries 890 
 * IBM zSeries 990 
 * IBM zSeries 800 
 * IBM zSeries 900 
 * S/390 Parallel Enterprise Server Generation 5 and 6 
 * S/390 Multiprise 3000 
 * Other manufactures compatible servers capable of running z/VSE

Software Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014759&amp;aid=1]  * z/VSE V3.1, or later 
 * Language Environment V1.4.4, or later 
 * CICS/VSE V2.3 or CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA V1.1.1, or later 
 * For APPC channels: VTAM V4.2, or later 
 * For TCP/IP channels: TCP/IP for VSE V1.5F (or equivalent), or later

Compatibility [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014759&amp;aid=1]  * WebSphere MQ for z/VSE V3.0 is compatible with MQSeries for VSE/ESA V2.1.2. 
 * Applications from MQSeries for VSE/ESA V2.1.2 can be migrated without change. 
 * There are no migration issues. 
 * WebSphere MQ for z/VSE will participate in distributed queuing with all currently supported V5, V6, and V7 WebSphere MQ products on all supported distributed and z/OS platforms, and with the existing MQSeries for VSE/ESA V2.1.2 product. However, WebSphere MQ for z/VSE V3.0 will not support participation in any WebSphere MQ cluster. 
 * Explorer support to view and manage WebSphere MQ for z/VSE V3.0 queue managers and MQSeries for VSE/ESA V2.1.2 queue managers will need WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.6 (planned availabilty first quarter 2009) or V7.0.0.1 or WebSphere MQ Explorer Category 3 Support Pac MS0T. The Explorer itself does not run on the z/VSE platform. 
 * For more information on z/VSE V4.2, refer to Software Announcement 208-323 [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&appname=gpateam&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS208-323], dated October 21, 2008.
