PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Creating a Centera Fixed Content Device object to connect to an EMC Centera storage device in FileNet Content Platform Engine on HP-UX or Sun Solaris Unix results in an error message indicating "no FPLibrary in java.library.path". 

CAUSE
Java Virtual Machine may be running in 32 bit mode when 64 bit is required.

ENVIRONMENT
CPE 5.2 FP3 on HP-UX Unix
Oracle WebLogic Application Server 12c
Hybrid 32 and 64 bit JDK

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This behavior occurs using a 32/64-bit hybrid JVM (such as the HP JDK for HP-UX and SUN JDK for Solaris SPARC). While the JVM supports both 32 and 64 bit operation, it defaults to 32 bit operation. FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2.x requires a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine. 

Use the -d64 flag when using 32/64-bit hybrid JVM to force it into 64 bit operating mode by adding this argument to the J2EE application server startup script.
