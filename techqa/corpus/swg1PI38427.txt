ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You will not be able to continue to install agents on the z/OS
   platform once the
   installer fails. The result will be that some files are in the
   wrong encoding preventing further install attempts. For example,
   when you have installed UCD in an directory that does not have
   permission to create files. The encoding of the files is
   incorrect and further attempts to install fail with the error:
   
   opt/apache-ant-1.8.4/bin/ant 1: FSUM7332 syntax error: got ),
   expecting Newline
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make a backup of the installer files before installing or rerun
   the SMP/E installer.
