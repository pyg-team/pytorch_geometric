IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server Version 11.4.0, Fix Pack 7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FInfoSphere+Master+Data+Management+Collaboration+Server&fixids=11.4.0-WS-MDMCS-FP007IF000&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server
   11.4.0, there is an issue with advanced search which is at the
   top of the left navigation pane  (not to be confused with
   search template on LNP at the bottom). When an advanced saved
   search named 'PMR' which is supposed to return 2 items (request
   based on 2 primary keys) is clicked, and then on the 'run'
   button directly, the search returns no item. However, when it
   is first selected and after that if clicked on 'modify' and
   then on 'search', the 2 items are correctly returned.
   
   This issue only happens with some attributes types of the
   primary key. It does not work when the attribute is of type
   sequence but works fine when the attribute type is STRING.
   
   For example, using the date example, there was a difference in
   the results between the saved search 'run' and 'search'
   after 'modify' was clicked; and a difference when using the
   'OR'.
   
   'AND' saved search worked fine.
   
   Here are the repro steps:
   
   1. create some items in a catalog where the search key is the
   primary key and can be of type sequence
   2. create some saved  searches
   
   3. run the search by clicking on :
   a) direct 'run' button
   b) 'modify' and 'search' button
   
   Result:
   a) does not work
   b) works fine
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the 'modify' and 'search' button instead of 'run'
