Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation path for Tivoli Common Reporting 3.1.2.1 must be set correctly to ensure Fastback Reporting works for Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack version 6.1 or later. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you use Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack 6.1.12.1, or earlier, with Tivoli Common Reporting 3.1.2.1 installed 
or 
if you use Tivoli Storage Manager Fastback 6.1.12.2 and Tivoli Common Reporting 3.1.2.1 is not installed in the C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\reporting directory, 
then you need to complete the following steps before you can use Fastback Reporting: 

1. Open the setPaths.cmd file. The default path for the files is C:\Program Files (x86)\Tivoli\TSM\FastBack\reporting\bin. 

2. Set the TCR_Path variable to the Tivoli Common Reporting installation path. For example, if Tivoli Common Reporting is installed in the path C:\Program Files\JazzSM\reporting, update the variable as follows: 
SET TCR_Path=C:\Program Files\JazzSM\reporting

3.Save and close the setPaths.cmd file.

You do not need to update the setPaths.cmd if you use Tivoli Storage Manager Fastback 6.1.12.2 with Tivoli common Reporting 3.1.2.1 installed in the default location (C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\reporting).
