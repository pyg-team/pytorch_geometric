 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to create or open a project in a web browser using the Cloud version of Studio (Studio Cloud) , Cast Iron v6.x attempts to launch Web Start Studio Cloud under the covers but it fails and produces an error. 

CAUSE
The "Unable to launch application" error associated with the exception:
com.sun.deploy.net.FailedDownloadException: Unable to load resource: 
https://cloud2.castiron.com/flash/design/com.approuter.studio.launcher-1.0.0.jar

could possibly occur because the Windows machine has Java v1.7 JRE installed and is using that version of Java to try to launch the Cast Iron v6.x Web Start Studio Cloud instead of using Java v1.6 JRE. Cast Iron v6.x Web Start Studio Cloud does not support Java v1.7.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A snippet of the exception stack trace that occurs is similar to the following: 

 
com.sun.deploy.net.FailedDownloadException: Unable to load resource: https://cloud2.castiron.com/flash/design/com.approuter.studio.launcher-1.0.0.jar

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the exception and launch Cast Iron v6.x Web Start Studio Cloud, uninstall the Java v1.7 JRE from the Windows machine and browser. Once the Java v1.7 JRE is successfully removed from the machine you can then install Java v1.6 JRE and try to launch Cast Iron v6.x Web Start Studio Cloud again. 

Java v1.6 JRE is the supported Java runtime to be used with Cast Iron v6.x Studio Cloud.
