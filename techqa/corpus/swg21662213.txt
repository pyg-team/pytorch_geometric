PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You upgrade your Rational Developer for System Z (RDz) V8.5 that includes CICS Explorer v1.1.1 to RDz V9.0 that includes CICS Explorer V5.1.1. Afterwards, your CICS Explorer workspace preferences contain duplicate filter preferences for the data set view, host connections, and credential preferences. 

SYMPTOM
You have an old RDz workspace and have continued to use it with your new RDz V9 installation. You have duplicate connections (in which the Secure connection TLS/SSL option value might be reversed).


CAUSE
Some code in CICS Explorer provides a backward migration facility for users who keep the same workspace when moving up to a newer version of CICS Explorer in RDz, and then use the workspace with the older version again. 

This code can get into a loop, causing duplicate connections to be created each time RDz is restarted.


ENVIRONMENT
RD/z V9 using a workspace created with RD/z V8.5.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, either: 

 * Create a new workspace that has not been used with RDz V8.5. 
 * Upgrade CICS Explorer within RDz to V5.1.1.4. And, manually remove the duplicate connections.
