APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While the Pure System storehouse shows that both MQ 8.0.0.4 and
   MQ 8.0.0.2 packages are available, when attempting to deploy a
   pattern using MQ 8.0.0.4, MQ 8.0.0.2 is deployed instead.
   Trace of this issue confirms that mq-8.0.0.2.tar.gz is
   downloaded from the storehouse and installed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This affects users of IBM Pure Application System version
   2.1.2.0, and version 2.2.0.0 and later fix packs, who wish to
   install the IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types at
   version 1.0.0.2 or earlier.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Because of an interface change in IBM Pure Application System
   2.1.2.0, and in 2.2.0.0 and greater, installation and upgrade of
   IBM MQ at the latest maintenance level contained in the
   pattern-type failed. The installation appeared to succeed, but
   IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 was installed and the subsequent fixpack update
   was not applied.
   
   For IBM Pure Application System releases earlier than 2.1.2.0
   and at version 2.1.2.1, all versions of IBM MQ contained in the
   pattern-type can successfully be installed. Maintenance can also
   be successfully applied to running pattern instances.
   
   For IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and later, only
   IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 could be successfully installed. It was not
   possible to install later versions e.g., 8.0.0.4, or to apply
   maintenance to running pattern instances.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ Pure System Pattern has been updated so that the
   maintenance lifecycle processing now checks for correct object
   type.
