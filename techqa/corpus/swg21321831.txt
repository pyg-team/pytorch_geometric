You can click on the "Current Status" tab on ISA to view the detailed collector execution.

If the product is not found on your system, or if you run the collector against a different version of the product than specified by the collector, a prompt will display providing a list of products installed on your system.

Select a product from the pull down menu and click OK. Or, you can choose to Skip to let the collector run to completion, gathering only the install information.


When the collector is completed, it will request feedback about ISA. Select Yes, to provide feedback. Select No to continue. 

It will also ask you whether you would like to FTP the collected data. Please note that this is using the ftp protocol. If you have concern on the security of the data being transferred, please leverage the service request web page to transfer the data to your IBM Support team. 

These are the FTP options. 

 1. FTP the Logs to IBM. If you have a PMR number, you can send the collected data directly to IBM Support team.
