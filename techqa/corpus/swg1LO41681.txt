ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Question: Customer would like to change the default font for new
   memo only and
   made the change permanent.
   
   We can change and set the font permanently for new memo by
   changing the Text
   Properties of the Body Field in the Memo form design. However,
   the customer
   does not wish to make modification to the mail template.
   
   I have tried to make the change via the File/Preferences/User
   Preferences/Basics but it does not seem to work as desired since
   the change is
   global.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Title: Can you change the default font for only new memos under
   
          User Preferences?
