APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  NEED DOCUMENTATION ON CATCSBPROXY LOG
   MESSAGES
   .
   Scenario:
   We have implemented a gateway and proxy using
   CATCsbProxy.
   We receive messages in the log file and have not
   documentation as to what they mean and if we
   should be taking corrective action.
   One particular error was seen during a loss of
   service to 70 of our users.
   We need some documentation of what the following
   message mean and what we should be doing to
   eliminate them if possible.
   .
   1. Write error on intranet socket of
   proxy_server:proxy_port: 03719-0000001034
   (Broken pipe)
   2. Write command data failed on
   proxy_server:proxy_port: 05690-0000000000 (
   Socket is not connected ) socket 5
   3. Write command data failed on
   proxy_server:proxy_port: 05690-0000000000 (
   Broken pipe ) socket 5
   4. Open connection on proxy_server:proxy_port
   failed (Invalid argument)
   .
   It would be more helpful if error messages and
   suggestions for resolution were in the standard
   documentation for CATCsbProxy.
   These are the same type of messages that we
   have seen since R15 through R17.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   ENOVIA
   .
   Restriction Explanation:
   Log messages quoted are very low level :
   CATCsbProxy relies on sockets, when
   these sockets are disconnected, there are write
   messages poping about this event. These
   messages are close to C language system calls and
   are intended for debug purpose by DS people in
   charge of the component. Since the PMR has no
   attached log file, we cannot either diagnostic a
   problem by inspecting such events occurences over
   time ; and even with a log, we'd need to know what
   kind of scenario led to such traces.
   .
   By-Pass
   While not documented and low-level, log messages
   are self-explanatory for network aware people: if
   there is an increase of messages related to sockets
   disconnection, then one such investigate what in
   the WAN between CATCsbProxy gateway and
   CATCsbProxy untunnel might cause so many
   disconnections. While the tunnel is made to support
   WAN conditions, too frequent disconnections lead to
   costly re-connection of socket - that's close to what
   happen with HTTP 1.0 proxies that do not quite
   support keep-alive.
