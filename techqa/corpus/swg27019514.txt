Cross-Platform Security 

InfoSphere Guardium’s cross-platform solution is ideal for heterogeneous environments because it supports all major DBMS platforms and protocols running on all major operating systems. 

This table shows all currently supported platforms and versions.

Host-Based Monitoring 

Unique in the industry, S-TAPs are lightweight software probes that monitor both network and local database protocols (shared memory, named pipes, etc.) at the OS level of the database server. S-TAPs minimize any effect on server performance by relaying all traffic to separate InfoSphere Guardium appliances for real-time analysis and reporting, rather than relying on the database itself to process and store log data. S-TAPs are often preferred because they eliminate the need for dedicated hardware appliances in remote locations or available SPAN ports in your data center. 

This table shows all OS platforms and versions for which S-TAPs are currently available.
