Title: IBM How To: Limit the number of rows displayed in a list - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to limit the number of entries displayed in a list. 

Example: X is a number (for example 10) In a "Top X" report, there is a tie for Xth place. This results in two entries having "X" as their rank, so the filter [Rank] <= X will actually return eleven entries. 

The technique described below will remove one of these entries. The entry removed depends on the order in which the data is returned from the data source. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the running-count function to create a data item that increments at every row, and filter on that running-count.

Steps:1) Add a data item to the query: running-count([data item to limit]). 

If there are multiple sets of data being ranked, the running-count will need to reflect that instead:

running-count([data item] for [grouping data item])

2) Add a filter to the query:

[running count data item] <= 10

Alternate solution: 

1) In Query 1, add every data item you want in the list report

2) In the same query, create the query calculation rank.

rank([dataitem] for report)

3) Go to the Query explorer and click on Queries.

4) Drag in a new Query (Query 2)

5) Drag Query 1 to the right side of Query 2 (so that a subquery is created)

6) Click on the query 2.

7) Drag in every dataitem from the Query1 to Query 2.

8) Add a new filter in Query2. (click on the query items tab, drag in rank and [rank] <=X )

9) Go to the page, select the list, change the query from Query 1 to Query 2.

The list will show the first X items in the list ranked based on the [dataitem].
