APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)
   profiles either by using the manageprofiles command or the
   profile management tool (PMT) GUI, select a non-default
   location (that is, a location other than
   <install_root>/profiles/<profileName>) for the profile, and
   run the BPMConfig -create command to configure the IBM BPM
   deployment environment but do not specify the
   bpm.dmgr.profilePath and bpm.de.node.#.profilePath properties
   in the input configuration properties file, the BPMConfig
   command stops with an error similar to the following error:
   
    CWMCB0003E: A profile was not created for DmgrProfile2.
   
   The BPMConfig log file contains a validation error similar to
   the following validation error:
   
       profileName: DmgrProfile2 is already in use. Specify
   another name.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can workaround the problem by specifying theprofile  path
   in the deployment.properties file
   
   For Deployment manager use indicate your Dmgr iprofile path
   bpm.dmgr.installPath=/IBM/BPM855/
   bpm.dmgr.profilePath=/IBM/Profiles/myDmgr
   
   For customNode
   bpm.de.node.1.installPath=/IBM/BPM855/
   bpm.de.node.1.profilePath=/IBM/Profiles/MyCustomProfile1

   ****************************************************************
   When the bpm.dmgr.profilePath and the bpm.node.#.profilePath
   properties are omitted from the input configuration properties
   file for the BPMConfig command, these properties start with
   the corresponding default profile location, which is
   <bpm.dmgr.installPath>/profiles/<bpm.dmgr.profileName> for the
   deployment manager profile and
   <bpm.node.#.installPath>/profiles/<bpm.node.#.profileName> for
   the managed node profiles. If a profile already exists at a
   non-default location, the profile is not found and the
   BPMConfig command tries to create the profile, which leads to
   an error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 that allows the
   BPMConfig -create command to find  existing profiles even when
   they have been created in a non-default location and the
   corresponding bpm.dmgr.profilePath and
   bpm.de.node.#.profilePath properties have not been set in the
   input configuration properties file.
