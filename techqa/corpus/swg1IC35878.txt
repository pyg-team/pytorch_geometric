ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer was adding a new TSM server to his operation. He
   decided to change his naming convention which requires using the
   SET SERVERNAME command to change the TSM server name. This
   caused all of his Windows clients to become out of synch with
   their generated passwords. The name of the TSM server is part of
   the path in the registry to the stored password the client uses
   to authenticate. When the servername changes, the client looks
   in a new path in the registry for the password key and is not
   able to find one. All Windows clients will fail their backups
   if on a schedule and passwordaccess generate is used until there
   is manual intervention on each client to reset the password
   after the servername change.
   -
   Error messages in the dsmerror.log on the client will be the
   standard login failure messages:
   sesscntl.cpp (3183): sessOpen: Error 137 from signon
   authentication.
   -
   However, the customer should also see this which indicates a
   failure to find the registry key (because the servername is
   now changed and it is part of the path to the key):
   pssec.cpp ( 694): ReadPswdFromRegistry(): getRegValue():
   Win32 RC=2 .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None. Use caution when changing the server name of the TSM
   server using the SET SERVERNAME command. Windows client
   passwords will have to be manually reset at the client to ensure
   scheduled operations can continue.
