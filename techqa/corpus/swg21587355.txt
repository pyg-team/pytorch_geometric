Title: IBM The console log gets heavily populated with Event Messages when DDM is enabled - United States

PROBLEM
After enabling Domino Domain Monitor (DDM), the console log gets heavily populated with "Normal" Event Messages such as: 

 Replication of <database name> from <database name> completed successfully 

 Replication of <database name> to <database name> completed successfully 

 

These messages are so intensive that they are too noisy and clog up the console log.



CAUSE
This is a code defect. 

This logged event happens because one or more DDM "scheduled replication check" probe has been enabled. 

They are clearing events. What that means is ... If a missed scheduled repl alert has been logged/opened in DDM.NSF, that DDM entry will automatically get closed when the replication actually happens. So every time a successful replication happens (that matches the probe), the clearing event is logged. If there is an matching open DDM.NSF entry, it will be found and closed. 

The clearing event only gets logged to DDM.NSF if a the open entry already exists. 

This clearing event is too noisy. The clearing event should never be logged to the Domino console or log.nsf. 

I am not aware of a logging flag that will exclude the clearing event from console.log. But that could be implemented, similar to any of the other flags.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPR PHEY8S6FWX has been created to track this problem. 

A fix will be implement to switch off the event messages being outputted to the console log
