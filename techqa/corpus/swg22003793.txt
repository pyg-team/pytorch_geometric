CVE-2016-7055 CVE-2017-3731 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Two potential denial of service vulnerabilities have been reported by the OpenSSL project. IBM DataPower Gateways has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Relevant CVE Information: 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
