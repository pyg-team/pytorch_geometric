QUESTION
 Why are there two flavors of the WebSphere Adapter for SAP Applications - CWYAP_SAPAdapter.rar and CWYAP_SAPAdapter_Tx.rar? 

ANSWER
The JCA specification defines three levels of transaction support for Resource Adapters


 * NoTransaction  * Auto-commit
   
   
 * LocalTransaction  * Implement javax.resource.spi.LocalTransaction 
    * Implemented by SAP adapter for outbound interfaces
   
   
 * XATransaction  * Implement javax.transaction.xa.XAResource 
    * Not implemented by SAP adapter for outbound
   
   


To enable LocalTransaction support for the resource adapter, the WebSphere Adapter for SAP Applications has implemented the javax.resource.spi.LocalTransaction interface.  1. It is a system-level interface, which enables the application server to manage the local transactions for the resource adapter. 
 2. The supported transactions are managed locally by the resource manager of the EIS. 
 3. You cannot work with multiple resource managers in a single transaction; you can do this with distributed transactions.


The adapter build produces 2 Resource Archive (RAR) files  * CWYAP_SAPAdapter.rar 
 * CWYAP_SAPAdapter_Tx.rar


Use the non-Tx Resource Archive when you only need AutoCommit.  * Adapter invokes commit() after each Interaction.execute() method call â€“ for success 
 * Adapter invokes rollback() in case of failure or exceptions during method call


Use the Tx Resource Archive when you need to have transaction support  * Adapter implements the commit() and rollback() method but does not invoke them directly 
 * The application server manages transactions and appropriately invokes commit() or rollback()
