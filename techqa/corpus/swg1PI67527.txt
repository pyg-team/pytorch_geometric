APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the integration node is cancelled, the integration servers
   will remain active. When the integration node is then restarted,
   the admin agent will stop the integration servers before
   restarting them.  There is a small timing window that can result
   in the admin agent attempting to restart the integration servers
   before they have finished shutting down, resulting in the
   following BIP2112E message:
   
   +BIP2112E (Msg 1/1) MQ10BRK EG01 0 INTEGRATION NODE
    INTERNAL ERROR: DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION 'Failed to
    acquire execution group lock - duplicate execution
    group processes?', 'ImbFile::WriteLock::WriteLock()
    reported 'Failed to acquire write lock on file'
    with values... ''Failed to acquire write lock on
    file'' ''/u/wmqi10/broker/MQ10BRK/components/MQ10BRK
    /12a345a6-7fe8-9d0d-1234-a5cd678f9e1f/.lock'''112''.
