APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Not a regression, issue reproducible since GA. Scenario is also
   working if syndicating on servers with the same WCM level.
   
   When an item is deleted on the syndicator, the item is no
   longer
   visible from the library on the subscriber which is OK, but
   the item does not appear in the deleted items view.
   
   A 'Could not fail item with id...' warning is seen on the
   syndicator logs, and TransformationExceptions is thrown on the
   subscriber (logs attached).
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Ensure the syndicator and subscriber server WCM level is
   different  (eg. 7000GA to 70001.CF15).
   2. Setup a syndicator/subscriber pair and syndicate a library
   with the 'All Items' scope.
   3. Delete an item on the syndicator.
   4. After the update, browse to the deleted items view on the
   subscriber. Note the deleted item is not there (but the items
   is
   correctly removed from the library iteself).
