Q & A 
Q. Where do I get this utility? and will this work with 9.5 ? 
A. The Cognos TM1 Operation Console is selected by default during installation. You can instead choose to install it on a computer separate from the computer used for the Cognos TM1 server by deselecting it during the standard installation, then running the installation on the separate computer and selecting only the Cognos TM1 Operations Console. 

Q. So how do I get Cognos TM1 Operations console on IBM Cognos TM1 9.5 and IBM Cognos Express environment ? 
A. Cognos TM1 Operations Console is not available on IBM Cognos TM1 9.5 and IBM Cognos Express. However, You can monitor their corresponding TM1 servers.
