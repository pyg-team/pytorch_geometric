ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  'the copies of all process of a plug-in' does not show the
   Workflow after closing RMC and reopen it, here an instance
   'the copies of all process of the process.standard_RUP.base-ibm'
   does not show the Workflow
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue:
   
   1. Steps using the customer library called
   '45441.800.624.lib.7.5.1.2.prac-Q12012'and attached:
   - create a new plug-in in a package example
   process.standard_rup.
   - select the process.standard_rup package and right click and
   select the 'New Method plug-in' item, it opens the window.
   - select the 'Create from existing method plug-in or package'
   option
   - next as default, the name of the plug-in is showed without the
   name of the package in front, like process.standard_rup_2 (as in
   point 2) but there is the plug-in name only that a rename in
   'XXX' for example
   - the new plug-in 'XXX' will be created on the tree root becasue
   not specified any path by defaul as I said
   - a new configuration called 'standard_rup_ibm_2' is created
   - In this new plug-in XXX I open any process and select the
   'Open Activity Diagram' function in the workbreak down
   structure, no problem I can see the diagram.
   - close RMC
   - open again RMC and select any process in the new plug-in 'XXX'
   - Select the 'Open Activity Diagram' function in the 'workbreak
   down structure' of a process and the diagram does not exist
   anymore and the message  'No diagram file exist for this
   process. Do you want to create one?' is showed.
   
   
   If RMC crashes when publishing the site or RMC is closed then
   next time you open it and select the 'Open Activity Diagram'
   function in the 'workbreak down structure' of a process the
   diagram does not exist anymore and the message  'No diagram file
   exist for this process. Do you want to create one?'  is showed.
   This after any copy in the process.
   
   After the publishing the site does not have anymore the workflow
   in the 'Delivery processes-?Standard RUP' because it is
   connected with the missing diagram.
   see picture called 'standard RUP published default site' the one
   from the default site of RUP provided with RMC
   see picture called 'standard RUP published by customer library'
   to see what the customer does not see in the published site as
   result of the missing diagram
   
   Note: If I check the new configuration created
   'standard_rup_ibm_2' in 'plug-in and package selection' tab I do
   not see checked the plug-in  'base-ibm' I used as copy but I
   have the plug-in created 'XXX' checked
   If I check the configuration 'standard_rup_ibm' in plug-in and
   package selection I do see checked the plug-in  'base-ibm' I
   used as copy
   
   Customer used this library we provided with he fixed issue in
   the plug-in unlocked(he exported all his plugins and imported
   them into this provided library with locked plugin.)

   ice_library/lib.7.5.1.2.prac.zip
   
   
   
   2.  I did the same steps using the prac7.5.2.1 default library.
   
   -selecting the process/standard_rup package I create a new
   plug-in from 'base-ibm' with the same option 'Create from
   existing method plug-in or package' (the package name shows by
   default process.standard_rup_2). The new plug-in created is
   called process.standard_rup_2.base_ibm.  A new package called
   'standard_rup_2' is created
   - In this new plug-in base_ibm I open any process and select the
   'Open Activity Diagram' function in the workbreak down
   structure, no problem I can see the diagram.
   - close RMC
   - open again RMC and select any process in the new plug-in
   'base_ibm'
   - Select the 'Open Activity Diagram' function in the 'workbreak
   down structure' of a process and the diagram does not exist
   anymore and the message  'No diagram file exist for this
   process. Do you want to create one?' is showed.
   
   After the publishing the site does not have anymore the workflow
   in the 'Delivery processes-?Standard RUP' because it is
   connected with the missing diagram.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  RMC 7.5.2 provides a fix for this issue in standard single
   location libraries which are the most  common cases. For
   workspace library cases, we created a work item
   "RATLC00434318: Handle process diagram copy for new plugin
   based on old plugin of a ws lib",  and will fix it in the
   future release.
