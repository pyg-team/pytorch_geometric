APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Process Portal indexer might incorrectly delete
   instances and tasks from the process index, resulting in the
   following symptoms:
   
   -Tasks not being searchable in Process Portal (by entering
   search terms in the Search box on the Work tab)
   -Tasks not being shown in the Team Performance dashboard
   -Instances not being shown in the Processes tab
   -Instances not being shown in Process Performance dashboard
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Rebuild the process index by following the procedure documented
   in the article:
   https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/209176/how-to-inves [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/209176/how-to-inves]

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you implement a batch process to create process instances,
   the Process Portal indexer might add some instances to the
   Process Portal index before those instances are saved to the
   database.  Subsequently, the indexer notices that the instances
   are not in the database, and deletes the instances from the
   index.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is currently targeted for inclusion in an upcoming
   cumulative fix on IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.6.0
   that ensures that newly created instances remain in the Process
   Portal index once they are added.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Not applicable
