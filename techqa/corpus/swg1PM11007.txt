APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer encountered a production problem where an MQ
   pageset was full. After investigation, they found out it was
   because the dead letter queue was filled with lots of messages.
   Further investigation of the contents of the messages in the
   dead letter queue showed that the dead letter messages were
   because that an initialization queue was full and that
   additional trigger messages all kept being put to the dead
   letter queue. In the MQ log, they could not find anything
   telling us the INITQ was full; the customer could only find the
   log entries that contained RC 2192 (pageset full).
   We are taking this APAR to investigate the possibility of
   issuing a console message when there is a failure to put a
   trigger message to an initiation queue.

   ****************************************************************
   CSQMTRG2 attempts to write a trigger message to an initiation
   queue but receives an error. A message is written to the
   dead-letter queue but no notification of the error is written to
   the log. After repeated occurrences of this it is possible that
   the page set containing the dead-letter queue becomes full.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQMTRG2 has been changed to output a message to the log if an
   error occurs when writing to an initiation queue.
   
   The message will not be issued more than once every 30 seconds
   for each initiation queue.
   
   
   The message is new and is:
   
   'CSQM057E +ssid CSQMTRG2 MQPUT of trigger message failed for
                           queue 'init queue name',MQRC=2053'
   
   
   Documentation should be changed as follows:
   
   In WebSphere MQ for z/OS Messages and Codes Version 7.0.1
   Section Messages
   Sub-Section Message manager messages (CSQM...)
   add
   ____________________________________________________
   CSQM057E csect-name MQPUT of trigger message failed
            for queue q-name, MQRC=mqrc
   
   
   Explantion: an error has occurred when writing to an
               initiation queue.
   Severity: 8
   
   System Action:
