PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Service calling failed with a timeout when calling WebSphere MQ binding import from a mediation flow. 

SYMPTOM
When you call the WebSphere MQ binding import in the test client, it is successful. However, when you call the same from a mediation flow, you receive the following error. 

"A response does not arrive within the designated wait time. Adjust the timeout parameter value for the invokeResponse() invocation, or the Transaction Manager timeout setting if longer wait time is needed."

CAUSE
A response is not received when the flow is invoked from the Mediation Flow Component. This issue is caused when the message is put to the WebSphere MQ queue, but not committed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, complete the following steps to change the default Asynchronous invocation value to 'Call': 

 1. From the Properties of the mediation flow component, in the 'Details' section, click the partner reference.
    
    
 2. Select the 'Qualifiers' tab on the right hand panel. 
    
    
 3. Highlight the 'Asynchronous invocation' Quality of Service Qualifier.
    
    
 4. In the panel below, change the value from 'Commit' to 'Call'.
