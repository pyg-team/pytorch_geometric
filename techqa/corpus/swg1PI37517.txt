PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the month_year
   update to the Information Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 8.5 issues will be addressed:
   ----
   ID: PI37517
   Problem:  When using AdminTask.applyConfigProperties to change
   the password of the keystore an error occurs.
   
   "com.ibm.websphere.management.cmdframework.CommandValidationExce
   ption: Key store did not verify.  Make sure the file exists,
   check the key file type and password."
   
   The password is actually changed, but the verification is
   failing.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Running administrative commands using
   properties files, is updated with an AVOID TROUBLE note that
   reads as follows:
   
   AVOID TROUBLE:  Commands identified in the properties file are
   run twice (as a default) when you use the
   applyConfigProperties command.
   The first command run occurs during validation and a second
   command run occurs if the validation is successful.
   Some commands cannot run twice successfully, such as commands
   that immediately update passwords.  This condition causes an
   error in running the commands twice.
   You can avoid this error possibility by running the
   applyConfigProperties command and use the  -validate false
   option.

   Problem: There is an installation problem when installing
   WebSphere Application
   Server Liberty Profile for Fix Pack 5. You can receive a
   java.lang.NullPointerException error when you download the
   WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile Fix Pack zip
   files and the use them as Installation Manager repositories to
   install or update Liberty.
   
   Resolution:  Topic,  Installing Liberty on distributed
   operating systems using the command line
   is updated with the following NOTE for V8.5.5.5:
   
   <--- V8.5.5.5 NOTE --->
   You can receive a NulLPointerException error condition when
   applying FixPack V8.5.5.5 for WebSphere Application Server
   Liberty Profile.
   The error can occur when you download the WebSphere
   Application Server Liberty profile Fix Pack zip files
   and use them (at the down loaded directory location) to
   install or update the Liberty profile.  You can work around
   this V8.5.5.5 error condition by taking the following steps:
   
   1. Unzip the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile Fix
   Pack zip file to a temporary directory.
   
   2. Use the temporary directory as the Installation Manager
   repositories to install or update the  Liberty profile.
   
   See the example below:
   unzip 8.5.5-WS-LIBERTYPROFILE-OS390-FP0000005.zip to
   /tmp/fp8555
   # ./imcl install
   com.ibm.websphere.liberty.v85_8.5.5005.20150305_2214
   -installationDirectory
   /SERVICE/usr/lpp/WebSphere/Liberty/V8R5
   -repositories /tmp/fp8555
   -acceptLicense

   Problem:  After you create and associate shared libraries in
   the WebSphere Applicatoin Server environment, you need to be
   aware that if you add any new JAR files to the shared
   libraries, reloading the JAR does not complete successfully.
   A warning to this effect needs to be added to the WebSphere
   Application Server knowledge center.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Managing shared libraries, is updated.  A
   note is added to the section, About this Task which reads:
   AVOID TROUBLE: If you are adding a new JAR to the shared
   libraries that are defined for your system, always remember to
   restart the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) so that this shared
   library addition for the new JAR becomes known to the system.
   
    This update will also apply to V7.0 and V8.0 levels of the
   knowledge center.
   ------
   ID: 764872
   Problem:  When migrating from WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 to WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 and
   using the administrative console, there is a missing checkbox
   for initial state in WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5,
   yet topic,  EJB container settings, contains a description of
   initial state.  The knowledge center needs correction.
   
   Resolution:  topic,  EJB container settings, is updated and
   the initial state description is removed.
   
   This update also applies to Version 7.0 and 8.0 of the
   knowledge center.
   -----
   ID: 765645
   Problem:  APAR PM95664 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM95664] added custom property,
   com.ibm.ws.recoverylog.disableNonHARegistration, but it is not
   documented in the knowledge center.
   
   Resolution: Topic,  Java virtual machine custom properties, is
   updated and the custom property,
    com.ibm.ws.recoverylog.disableNonHARegistration is added as
   follows:
   
   com.ibm.ws.recoverylog.disableNonHARegistration
   When the application server is not a member of a cluster that
   has failover of transaction log recovery enabled, it is not
   necessary for the recovery log service to register with the HA
   Manager.
   However, if failover is later enabled, and only a partial
   restart of the cluster occurs, set this custom property to
   true so that the recovery log service does not register with
   the HA Manager.
   Valid values are true and false.
   The default value is false.
   
   This update also applies to Version 7.0 and 8.0 of the
   knowledge center.
   ------
   ID: 171681 (RTC)
   Problem: In order for you to upgrade WebSphere Applicatoin
   Server (Liberty) without being
   connected to the IBM Websphere Liberty Repository, you will
   need to add
   -properties user.feature="" to the imcl instasll command. The
   
   user.feature property is not handled properly in the response
   file. The use of this user.feature= óÔé¼  ¢ óÔé¼  ¢ property is
   documented in the knowledge center and should be.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Installing Liberty on distributed
   operating systems by using the command line,  and  is updated
   to add the following note to the Tips section of the topic:
   To ensure that your installation process completes for systems
   that do not have internet access specify the -properties
   user.feature="" parameter on the Installation Manager command
   line. If you do not specify this parameter, the installation
   process attempts to access the internet and an error occurs.
   
   ERROR: Unable to connect to the IBM WebSphere Liberty
   repository or local Installation Manager repository.
   
   Verify that firewalls are configured to allow the Installation
   Manager to access the internet, or that the local Installation
   Manager repository can be accessed. If the problem persists,
   then the repository server might be unavailable. To continue
   the installation without additional assets, specify the
   user.feature="" and user.addon="" parameters.
