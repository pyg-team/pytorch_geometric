ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1) The import of the ITM for VE  bundle using command:
   /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i
   <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix
   
   will fail with message:
   
   Unable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263
   
   This occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have
   old
   prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are
   not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle.
   Also, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails
   because the  installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit
   while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).
   There is no way to avoid it, you have to manually install the
   agent on the target node
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the wanted prerequisites are already present into the
   deport, you can anyway run the import ignoring the
   prerequisites (flag -n).
   Otherwise you need to install the N4 agent locally.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  tacmd command addBundles fails because n4 agent has old
   prerequisite for shared components, the agent cannot be
   installed on Linux 64 bit directly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  n/a
