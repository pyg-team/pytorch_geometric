PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  APAR NUMBER:  PJ40254
   PRODUCT:  z/TPF
   FUNCTIONAL AREA:  APACHE
   SHIPPED IN PUT:  9
   
   ABSTRACT:
   Apache 2.2 can send the wrong HTTP Connection header value.
   
   PACKAGE CONTENTS:
   Source Segments:
   None.
   
   Object Only Binaries:
   None.
   
   Configuration Independent Binaries:
   None.
   
   Support Files:
   None.
   
   OTHER BINARIES TO BUILD: NO
   None.
   
   COMMENTS:
   Apache 2.2 is sending the wrong HTTP Connection header value
   when termAfterReply is set by a SOAP Web Service application.
   The HTTP header Connection: Keep-Alive is erroneously sent
   instead of Connection: close.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
   The sample mod_tpf_soap.c module (and any customer modules
   based on it) should set r->connection->keepalive to
   AP_CONN_CLOSE instead of zero if binding->ECBctl equals
   termAfterReply. This will cause Apache 2.2 to send "Connection:
   close" instead of an erroneous "Connection: Keep-Alive" in
   reply to an input "Connection: Keep-Alive" header.
   
   COREQS: NO
   None.
   
   MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS: NO
   None.
   
   BUILD COMMANDS AND INSTRUCTIONS: NO
   None.
