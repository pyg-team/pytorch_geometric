CAUSE
The Java program components do not have access to a certificate to 'trust' the HTTPS/SSL connection.



ENVIRONMENT
Customer is using a self-created/self-signed SSL certificate (instead of paying for/using one of the 'trusted' providers of such certificates, such as Verisign). 

 * In other words, customer has enabled HTTPS / SSL encryption between client device and application server, but has used a self-created certificate.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the SSL certificate into the Java runtime environment (JRE) on the client, so that the JRE trusts the self signed certificate. 

 * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1495669.


Workaround: 

Either: 

 1. Replace the SSL certificate (used on the Controller application server's Microsoft IIS website) with a trusted commercial (not self-signed) certificate, such as one from Verisign or GoDaddy.com. 
 2. or reconfigure Controller to use HTTP (not HTTPS) connections between client device and Controller application server.
