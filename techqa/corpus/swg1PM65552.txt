PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  Liberty Profile server using web-fragmants  *
   *                  bundles                                     *
   ****************************************************************

   *                      serve static content from a             *
   *                      web-fragment if it is not in certain    *
   *                      locations in the WEB-INF/lib            *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Web application bundles (WAB) cannot serve static content from
   the META-INF/resources directory of a web-fragment if the web
   fragment archive is not in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the
   WAB. This problem occurs when a bundle fragment is attached
   to the WAB.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to support the serving of static
   content from anywhere within the web-fragment.
