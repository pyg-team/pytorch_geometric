Title: IBM Using the mqsireportproperties command in IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker for a single message flow - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How can I use mqsireportproperties command in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) to get information for a single message flow? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
MessageFlow is a valid reportable entity name for the -o parameter, but the mqsireportproperties command does not have the functionality to allow the specifying of a message flow or uuid. Therefore it is not possible to request the properties for just a single message flow. 
For example: If you try to run the following command:
mqsireportproperties <brokername> -e <EGname> -o MessageFlow -r

You would see the exception: BIP2330E MessageFlow does not exist

As a workaround you could put one message flow in the execution group. Then report the properties for all messages flows in the execution group with the following commands:

mqsireportproperties <brokername> -e <EGname> -o AllMessageFlows -a
mqsireportproperties <brokername> -e <EGname> -o AllMessageFlows -r
