QUESTION
 When creating an Index Update task in Cognos Business Intelligence, what is the difference between "Referenced data" and "All data" under Content options, and what is the expected result of each? 

CAUSE
"Referenced data" and "all data" provide different granularity in search results in Cognos.

ANSWER
With "Referenced data" we should see results for data referenced only in existing objects (reports, etc.) in Cognos. 
With "All data" it should be all data in the models associated with the content that is indexed. This means if there was an item that you knew existed in a model but that was not used in a report you should be able to search on that item and get results. These results would include all content that contained items directly related to the item you searched.

An example search using an index of the Cognos Samples that demonstrates "All data" is as follows: 

A Search for "Postal zone", which is not used explicitly in any reports in Cognos, would return a number of results. One of these reports is the Bonus Report. In the Bonus Report, the Postal Zone item is not present (but it is related to Country, which is).
