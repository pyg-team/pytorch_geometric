 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 When using Apache Tomcat as an application server for IBM Initiate Master Data Service, security vulnerabilities discovered in Apache Tomcat affect IBM Initiate Master Data Service. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2013-4286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286] 

DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, caused by an incomplete fix related to the handling of malicious request. By sending a specially-crafted request in a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and a Content-length header to the Apache HTTP server that will be reassembled with the original Content-Length header value, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0033 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0033] 

DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to hijack a valid user's session, caused by an error even when disableURLRewriting is enabled. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted link and log into the application, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account and possibly launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91423 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91423]

CVE-ID: CVE-2013-4322 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322] 

DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an incomplete fix related to the processing of chunked transfer coding without properly handling a large total amount of chunked data or whitespace characters in an HTTP header value. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91625 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91625]
