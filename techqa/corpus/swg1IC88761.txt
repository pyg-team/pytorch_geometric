APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Certificateificate management: Some services and adapters use
   system certificate ID, others use the system certificate name.
   This means that when the system certificate expires and a new
   one must be created, there is no simple way of updating
   all adapters to use the correct certificate. It should be
   standardized across all SI adapters that they use the system
   certificate name value.
   For example CDSA and HTTP Server/FTP Server adapter use the
   certificate Name. However, FTP and Http client
   adapter/Begin Session services
   use the certificate ID. Managing the certificates via
   HSM will not work as the object ID is still
   updated when the new certificate is imported into SI.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected: ALL
   Problem Description:
   Currently the only way to update the System Certificate is to
   delete and create a new system certificate with same name.
   But this creates a new object id instead of using the same.
   Ideally, the same object id should be updated with new
   certificate details.
   Problem Summary:
   Currently, to update the certificate, user has to delete the
   existing certificate and then create a new certificate with same
   certificate name.
   Instead, update the existing certificate without deleting it by
   providing an upload option in case of key certificate and pkcs.
   In case of self signed certificate, the individual fields will
   be
   editable.
   Platform Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With the fix, when user edits a system certificate, he/she has
   to choose among Self Signed, Key or PKCS 12 certificate.
   Providing an upload option in case of key certificate and pkcs.
   In case of self signed certificate the individual fields will be
   editable.
   > Update the system certificate from UI -
   (Exception: In self signed edit - "Set Certificate Signing Bit"
   field could not retain its older value as same is not saved in
   certificate or database,
   this value is only used to generate the certificate and is not
   known once the certificate is created. Hence, this value could
   not retain its older value.
   In Key cert and PKCS cert - password and file uploads are not
   retained as per the practice.)
   On click of edit link from certificate search result screen,
       Take the user to a new screen which asks to chose among
   three options:
                      o Self Signed Certificate
                      o Key Certificate
                      o PKCS12 Certificate
   Once the user chooses one of the above, the wizard will take
   care of showing the respective screens to edit the fields (self
   signed)
   or upload the .txt file (key cert) or upload .pfx file (pkcs12).
   Once user clicks finish, the same objective id will be updated.
