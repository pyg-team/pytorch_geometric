APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In some cases, when you hover or move the mouse pointer over a
   widget displayed in Business Space, extra white space is added
   below the widget.  This happens when the Internet Explorer 9
   browser is used to display Business Space.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Monitor
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually set the height of the widget to prevent extra white
   space from being displayed under the widget.  The height can be
   set by dragging the bottom of the widget or using the Resize
   option from the widget drop-down menu.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Extra white space is added below widgets in some cases when the
   Internet Explorer 9 browser is used to display Business Space.
   The additional white space can grow in size over time, causing
   you to scroll down considerably to reach a widget farther down
   on the page.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for Business Space in IBM Business Monitor
   V8.0.1.2 and IBM BPM Advanced V8.0.1.2 that adds a style
   definition for Internet Explorer 9 that ensures that no extra
   white space is displayed below widgets.
