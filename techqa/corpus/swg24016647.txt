 *  Installing and running Installation Manager in silent mode
   The method for installing and running Installation Manager in silent installation mode from a command line has changed. 
   Refer to the Installation Manager Information Center http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1m0r0/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1m0r0/index.jsp] for complete documentation on how to run it in silent mode. 
   
   Response File validation
   In previous releases, there was no command line validation . In Installation Manager version 1.1, if you invoke Installation Manager using incorrect command line options, IM will display an error dialog with a message noting the correct usage of the command line options, or generate the same message in the terminal mode if it is running in the silent mode.
