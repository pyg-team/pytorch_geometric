Text:
TPAEDOCLINK maximo unc path doclinks TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides info about Doclinks on a UNC Path configuration with issues to create new attachments 

SYMPTOM
Working with Attached Documents may bring you scenario where you get an error message like this, in the 'Create a File Attachment' dialog box :

System Message
BMXAA0884E - The entered path \\<server_name>\Maximo\DOCLINKS\Attachments is not a directory [More Information]


And if you try to modify the Default File Path in the 'Manage All Document Folders' dialog box, you get :

The specified path \\<server_name>\Maximo\DOCLINKS\Attachments is not valid. The specified patch must be a subdirectory of the system-defined top-level doclink directory.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
About the error "The entered path is not a directory" regarding attached documents, please check the following items.

>> If you access an application with DOCLINKS enabled (Work Order Tracking for example) - Select Action - Attachment Library/Folders - Manage Folders - is the path to the folders still correct?

You may need to go over configuration settings and network permissions, for valid network account with access to the network share.

Considering that if you try to view an existing attached document shows correctly and that you are aware that attached documents are case sensitive, please check :

1- Check whether the user that starts your services have full rights to the folder where the documents are being stored.

2- Also, all the IBM Windows services below need to be started as Network Domain admin Log On as user.

> IBM HTTP Administration
> IBM HTTP Server
> IBM WebSphere Application Server ctgCellManager
> IBM WebSphere Application Server Nodeagent

Make sure the NodeAgent service is set to run as a domain user ID with "Run as Part of the Operating System" permissions (so that the network user can see the full network).


One possible cause for this issue is that IBM WebSphere windows services are started as Local Systems account , and that the IBM HTTP Server 8.5 service is running an authorized network domain account.

Make sure that all IBM services are started with authorized network domain accounts.

Click the Windows Start button and navigate to Settings > Control Panel > Administrative tools > Services.

In a Test environment, stop both services bellow :

> IBM WebSphere Application Server ctgCellManager
> IBM WebSphere Application Server Nodeagent

Then you can right click on each of them, and select Properties.

On the Properties dialog box, under the Log On tab, make sure that the logon account is set to a valid network domain, rather than Local System account. 

This consists of the domain administrator logging in to the local machine and providing rights for the domain user to run the Windows service.

After this change you can restart Maximo server, then retest this issue scenario, trying to add new attachments in Maximo.
