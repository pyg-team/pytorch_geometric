QUESTION
 How do I use embedded Websphere Application Server without re-installing IBM Content Collector? 

CAUSE
During the initial installation of IBM Content Collector, "Manually to a different Websphere Application Server" was selected for how to deploy the IBM Content Collector Web Application and the IBM Content Collector Configuration Web Service.
