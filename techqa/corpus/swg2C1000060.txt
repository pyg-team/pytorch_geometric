CVE-2015-2017 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been identified in IBM Business Process Manager, and bundling products shipped with IBM Cloud Orchestrator and Cloud Orchestrator Enterprise (CVE-2015-2017) 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 IBM Business Process Manager, IBM HTTP Server, IBM Tivoli System Automation Application Manager, IBM Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatform, are shipped with IBM Cloud Orchestrator and IBM Cloud Orchestrator Enterprise Edition. 

 IBM SmartCloud Cost Management and IBM Tivoli Monitoring are shipped with IBM Cloud Orchestrator Enterprise Edition. 


CVEID: CVE-2015-2017 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2017] 

DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5
