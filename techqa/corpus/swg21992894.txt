Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus ( CVE-2016-2107,CVE-2016-2176) - United States

Text:
WMB IIB SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. The DataDirect ODBC Drivers used by WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2176 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2176]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, by sending an overly long ASN.1 string to the X509_NAME_oneline() function; an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to return arbitrary stack data in the buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
