APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DataPower change to prevent SSL TLS Man-in-the-Middle attack.
   The SSLM MitM attack is also known as CVE-2009-3555.
   This change is to prevent SSL renegotiations from occurring.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use mutual or client authentication until the new firmware can
   be installed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  *******************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance
   *                 Users.
   ******************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *****************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply fixpacks 3.7.1.12, 3.7.2.8, 3.7.3.7,
   *                 3.8.0.1 or superceding fix packs.
   ******************************************************
   A recently discovered vulnerability in the renegotiation feature
   of the SSL and TLS protocols allows an attacker to inject an
   arbitrary string into the SSL session. This vulnerability is
   commonly referred to as the SSL Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack
   or CVE-2009-3555.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DataPower SSL server implementation is not vulnerable to
   either form of  attack when using SSL client authentication,
   because the implementation requires immediate client
   authentication in the first SSL handshake (unlike vulnerable SSL
   server implementations that only require client authentication
   in a renegotiation handshake after seeing the request URL).
   
   However, the DataPower  SSL server implementation is vulnerable
   to the weaker form of attack when client authentication is not
   used. This weaker form of attack is limited, because it can only
   steal HTTP headers from the initial HTTP request of the attacked
   client. Most HTTP clients do not send authentication credentials
   in the initial HTTP request headers. Most HTTP clients wait
   until seeing certain HTTP status codes from the HTTP server
   before sending authentication credentials, and HTTP clients like
   these would not be vulnerable to this weaker form of attack.
   
   To confirm if your appliance uses SSL client authentication,
   look at the reverse/server Crypto Profile of the SSL Proxy
   Profile in question. If it contain a Validation Credentials,
   client authentication is in use.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Use mutual or client authentication until new firmware is
   installed.
