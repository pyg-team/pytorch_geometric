APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This issue is being observed as 'duplicate fixlets' for some
   customers. see bug 50674 and 44967
   
   Over time, some SCA sites have changed their fixlet numbering
   schemes. IF the
   customer had 1.1 installed at the time of re-numbering, SCA
   would not remove
   the fixlet using the previous numbering scheme and it would
   appear as if the
   external site has duplicate records.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  From Bug 44967
   
   fixed in scm/1.3 at
   http://dss-ci/view/SCM%201.3/job/dss-scm-package-1.3/29/ [http://dss-ci/view/SCM%201.3/job/dss-scm-package-1.3/29/]
   
   Also, sent an email to customer contact @ PENSION BENEFIT
   GUARANTY with
   instructions on a manual fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  We have found the problem and are planning to include a fix in
   the
   next release of TEM:SCA. If you want to fix your existing
   installatio
    before our next release, you can follow these steps;
   .
   1. ensure TEM:SCA is not currently or about to perform an import
   2. run the following SQL on the TEM:SCA database
   ==============================
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   exec dbo.freeze_date
   DELETE FROM [datasource_fixlets] WHERE (EXISTS (SELECT * FROM
   [datasource_sites] WHERE (([datasource_sites].[id] =
   [datasource_fixlets].[datasource_site_id]) AND
   ([datasource_sites].[valid_from] >
   [datasource_fixlets].[valid_from])
   AND ([datasource_sites].[is_custom] = 0))))
   exec dbo.thaw_date
   COMMIT TRANSACTION
   ==============================
   3. Wait until the next schedule import or perform a manual
   import. To
   perform a manual import, log into the TEM:SCA UI and navigate to
   to
   the "Management -> Imports" page. Click on the button "Import
   Now".
   .
   After the import completes, your external Checklists should no
   longer
   contain duplicate Checks.
