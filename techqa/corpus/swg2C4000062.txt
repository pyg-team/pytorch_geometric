DEFINITIONS
Regression: An error in the Maintenance Delivery Vehicle [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] (MDV) that produces incorrect or unexpected behavior causing a supported feature to stop functioning as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Coding errors that cause a regression
 * Documentation or packaging problems that cause a regression
 * Errors reported in a new function delivered in a MDV that cause a regression

Incomplete: An error in the MDV has not regressed, but does not work as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Fixed APARs which did not solve the original problem but did not break anything new
 * APARs reporting documentation errors, such as readme errors, that cause problems applying an MDV but do not lead to a regression




Notes:  * Regression and incomplete APARs are considered fix-in-error or MDV-in-error
 * Definitions above apply only to valid APARs that result in product fixes (APARs returned as working-as-designed are not assessed for being fix-in-error)
 * Issues in major releases due to new functionality do not apply in this definition

There are no known regressions to report.
