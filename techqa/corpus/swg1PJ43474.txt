   COMMENTS:
   z/TPFDF APAR PI44953 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI44953] adds the following new z/TPFDF data
   collection counters:
   CACHE_PARTIAL_IO_COUNT
   CACHE_PARTIAL_IO_REQUEST
   CACHE_READ_HIT
   CACHE_READ_MISS
   BLOCK_READ_DEPTH
   This APAR adds support to continuous data collection to collect
   those new counters in the existing CDC_TPFDF metric. The data
   collected by the CDC_TPFDF metric displays in the TPFDF
   workspace in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent for z/TPF.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
   1. You will need to use the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent for
   z/TPF (1.12.01.00) or later to be able to display the new
   counters. The monitoring agent and users guide are available
   for download from the TPF Tools website:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/tpf/maint/toolsztpf.html The
   users guide contains information about the new counters.
   2. Enter the ZCDCO STOP command before you install this APAR.
   
   COREQS: YES
