ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the technote
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022242, make
   the following updates:
   
   1) In DCF, add BPM Standard and Express as alternate references
   so that they are added to "IBM Business Process Manager
   Advanced" on the right side under Document information.
   2) Although the Content section includes the text "In this
   document, IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, IBM Business
   Process Manager Standard, and IBM Business Process Manager
   Express are collectively referred to as IBM Business Process
   Manager," we can further clarify this by adding the following
   text in bold in the "Version 7.5.1 Fix Pack 2 - Additional
   packages for IBM Business Process Manager" section:
   "Additional interim fixes are available for IBM Business Process
   Manager Version 7.5.1 Fix Pack 2. You can apply these fixes on
   top of Version 7.5.1 Fix Pack 2. These fixes apply to all the
   product editions:
   IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, IBM Business Process
   Manager Standard, and IBM Business Process Manager Express".
