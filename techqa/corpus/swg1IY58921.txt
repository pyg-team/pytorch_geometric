APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We have identified a discrepancy regarding the storing of
   the repository information in its cache. The stored
   information may contain a stale pointer to the SSLPeerName,
   and this is something we need to fix. It is, however, not
   clear why this would give rise to a SEGV when the SSLPeerName
   is copied, since we would expect that even if the pointer is
   stale, it is still a valid memory address for the purpose of
   copying. But this is a complicated area.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of SSL with WMQ clustering.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Code path existed that could result in non-refreshing of cache
   information which holds a pointer to the SSL peer name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ensured the SSL peer name cache pointer is maintained correctly.
   
   The fix will be included in the following PTFs:
   WebSphere MQ v5.3   CSD09
   Windows             U200223
