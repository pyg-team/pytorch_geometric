APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The mqsicreatebroker command for IIB V10 does not allow an
   IBM Integration Node to be configured without an MQ queue
   manager, even when the intention is to use an external high
   availability (HA) manager rather than a multi-instance queue
   manager to handle failover.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus v10 who want to create an
   Integration Node that is to be coordinated by an external high
   availability manager, and which does not need to be associated
   with a multi-instance MQ Series Queue Manager.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The mqsicreatebroker and mqsiaddbrokerinstance commands will not
   allow a high availability Intergation Node to be created without
   an associated queue manager.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

   tools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The mqsicreatebroker and mqsiaddbrokerinstance commands now
   allow the creation of a high availability broker without an
   associated multi-instance MQ Queue manager, where the intention
   is to use an external high availability coordinator to control
   fail over of an active Integration Node instance.
