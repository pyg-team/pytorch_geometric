Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When creating a new interview plan in Atlas and attempting to select an active interview questionnaire, the questionnaire does not show up. 

CAUSE
There is one (or more) question that was defined in the interview questionnaire as a "Confirmation" question. Such a questionnaire can only be used in a "hold + interview" notice, not in a "standalone" interview.

ANSWER
Remove the "Confirmation" question or re-define it as a "choice" question in order to be able to see the questionnaire in the interview plan.
