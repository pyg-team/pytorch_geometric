PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using Rational Application Developer (RAD) version 6.0, the WebSphereÂ® runtime libraries have been accidentally deleted and are not displayed in the build path. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
By default, when you create a Web Project, the WebSphere runtime libraries should already be listed in the build path. 

If for some reason the WebSphere runtime is accidentally deleted, you can select any one of the following three options to restore it (for example, using WebSphere Application Server version 6):


 1. Target the project to another server and then switch back to WebSphere Application Server v6.
    
    OR
    
 2. Add the following classpath entry to the .classpath file of the project: 
    <classpathentry kind="con" path="com.ibm.wtp.server.java.core.container/com.ibm.ws.ast.st.runtime.core.runtimeTarget.v60/was.base.v6"/>
    
    OR
    
 3. Export, then Import  1. Export the project as a WAR file  1. Right-click the project 
         2. Select Export... 
         3. Select WAR file 
         4. Click Next 
         5. Ensure the Web project is the project you want to export 
         6. Choose a destination to export to 
         7. Select the Export source files and Overwrite existing files checkboxes 
         8. Click Finish
        
        
     2. Import the project from the WAR file in order to bring back the WebSphere runtime libraries  1. Select File > Import > WAR file 
         2. Click Next 
         3. Browse to the WAR file that you exported earlier 
         4. Set the Web project name 
         5. Click Finish
        
        
    
    


Now if you look at the Libraries tab under the Java Build Path, you should see the WebSphere v6.0 runtime is once again present. 

The functionality to add a WebSphere runtime library is introduced in RAD v7.0.
