 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Installation Manager reports a CRIMA1168E error when installing IBM Process Federation Server (PFS) in IBM Business Manager (BPM). 

SYMPTOM
You receive the following error message and the installation fails: 

CRIMA1168E: The installation directory ("/opt/im") must not be a parent or sub-directory of the shared resources directory ("/opt/im/IMShared")


CAUSE
IBM Installation Manager (IM) will give this error while installing IBM PFS if you have an IM directory structure in which the IM Share directory is a subdirectory of the IM Installation directory.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade IBM Installation Manager to V1.8.1 before installing IBM Process Federation Server (PFS). To upgrade IM to V1.8.1, run the following command: 

<PFS_Installer_image>/IM64/install

Note: Use the same user ID of the original IM installation when you upgrade to IM V1.8.1.
