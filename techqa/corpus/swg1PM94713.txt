PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the DB2 Administration Tool and     *
   *                 IBM Tools Customizer (TCz) for z/OS who      *
   *                 use the Change Management related template   *
   *                 ADBCMBIV 'Verify CM Batch JCL procedure'.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When running the Change Management      *
   *                      related template ADBCMBIV 'Verify CM    *
   *                      Batch JCL procedure', the job fails     *
   *                      with a RC=12 / rc12 if the procedure    *
   *                      has been run before.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Change Management related template ADBCMBIV 'Verify CM
   Batch JCL procedure' job will failed with a RC=12 if the
   procedure has been run before.  To avoid this failure, the
   following enhancements are added in ADBCMBIV:
   
   1 Supersede pending changes when importing the change;
   2 Generate a recover change that lets the user back out of the
     change that has been completed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem has been resolved.
   
   Instructions on how to verify the CM Batch JCL procedure:
   
   1. Invoke TCz for DB2 Administration Tool, navigate to panel
   CCQPPRD "Product Parameters' and select the 'Installation
   verification jobs' option and then the 'Generate a CM Batch
   verification job' option.
   
   2. END/F3 to navigate back to panel CCQPWRK 'Customizer
   Workplace' and use line command "G" to generate or regenerate
   the jobs.
   
   3. On panel CCQPCST 'Finish Product Customization', use line
   command "E" to select the job template ADBCMBAT 'Create CM
   Batch JCL procedure',  and submit the job.
   
   4.  END/F3 back to panel CCQPCST 'Finish Product
   Customization', use line command "E" to select the job
   template ADBCMBSS 'Create CM Batch items', and submit the job.
   
   5.  END/F3 back to panel CCQPCST 'Finish Product
   Customization', use line command "E" to select the job template
   ADBCMBIV 'Verify CM Batch JCL procedure',  and submit the job.
   A change will be registered for the listed DDL in the IMCHG001
   DD.
   
   6. Invoke the DB2 Administration Tool and navigate to panel
   ADB2 'DB2 Administration Menu' and select option 'CM - Change
   management'.
   
   7. On panel ADB2C 'Change Management (CM)', select option
   '1 - Manage changes'.
   
   8. On panel ADB2C1 'CM - Manage Changes' select option '1 -
   Display changes'.
   
   9. If the Analyze is successful (status changes to ANALYZED),
   issue the 'RN - Run' line command on the change.  Panel
   ADB2C1X 'CM - Run a Change' will be displayed to generate
   the RUN job.  Press Enter and run the job.
   
   10. Verify that the change has been run successfully (status
   changes to COMPLETE).  If so, it means the CM Batch JCL
   procedure works.  Issue  the 'RC - Recover a change' line
   command to recover the change.
   
   Note:
   If TCz 'Verify CM Batch JCL procedure' job template ADBCMBIV
   was generated before, then regenerate the job and perform the
   above verification steps. If the job was generated and also
   previously submitted, then consider using the CM (Change
   Management) function to cancel or delete the change firstly,
   then verify the CM batch JCL procedure using the same steps
   as above but skip Step 3 and Step 4.
