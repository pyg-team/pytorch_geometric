APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Mediation modules which are restarted on a loaded server may not
   be available.
   .
   When a mediation module is stopped whilst requests to it are
   still being sent, then after subsequent restart, requests to the
   module may result in com.ibm.ejs.container.HomeDisabledException
   being thrown by the runtime. Without the fix for this APAR then
   either a restart of the module without load, or a server restart
   is required.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.0.1 and      *
   *                 v6.0.2.0, where you stop a Mediation Flow    *
   *                 Component in a server which is under load.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a module containing a Mediation    *
   *                      Flow Component is stopped which is      *
   *                      currently under load, occasionally      *
   *                      you may see a HomeDisabledException     *
   *                      exception thrown when you next start    *
   *                      the module.  It is then observed that   *
   *                      it is not possible to get the module    *
   *                      to further process messages once this   *
   *                      state has been reached, without a       *
   *                      server restart.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you encounter this problem, it is         *
   *                 recommended that you install the fix pack    *
   *                 which contains this program fix.  It is      *
   *                 currently targetted to be included with      *
   *                 6.0.2 Fix Pack 1 (v6.0.2.1).                 *
   *                 Alternatively, you may restart               *
   *                 the server to circumvent this problem        *
   *                 when encountered.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   As a Mediation Flow Component module is stopped, there is a
   small window during which the module may still accept
   an additional request, but is not in a state to process it.
   The consequence of this is that once the module is restarted,
   the cached local copy of the mediation flow session bean is
   invalid, which leads to a HomeDisabledException exception
   being thrown.  Restarting the server refreshes this cache,
   which clears the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The program fix associated with this APAR changes the point at
   which the modules cleanup code runs, such that it occurs after
   the point where the module can accept new requests.  There
   are no known side effects with this fix.
