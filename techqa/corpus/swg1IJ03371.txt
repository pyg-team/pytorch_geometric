APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Compatible units sub-tab add 2 lines: a line with the CU
   created previously without a task and another with the task 10.
   And when they duplicate the Estimate Request, an error appears
   that the Work Set 1 for Station 1 is a duplicate of Work Set 0.
   And when they delete the Work Set 1, and go to compatible unit
   sub-tab, they have 2 lines, one with work set 1 even if this
   Work Set does not exist.
   
   As a result, they have CU lines with work sets that do not
   exist, when Estimation action is performed, Maximo does not
   take into account those lines for calculations
   
   A. Go to Work Order Tracking (T&D)
   1) Create a new WO
   Work Order: WO1214

   ** It will prompt a System Message:
   BMXAP0205E - Work Set 1 for Station 1 of Version 1 is a
   duplicate of Work Set 0
   10) Go to Stations sub-tab and delete the line with the work
   set 1 in the Work Sets section
   11) Save.
   12) Go to compatible unit sub-tab and we have 2 lines, one with
   work set 1 even if this work set does not exist
   Note:
   As a result, we have CU lines with work sets that do not exist,
   when Estimation action is performed, Maximo does not take into
   account those lines for calculations
