 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160

DESCRIPTION:
OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.
