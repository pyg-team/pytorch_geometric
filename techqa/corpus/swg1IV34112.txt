ERROR DESCRIPTION

   checkbox is supposed to only become check when a primary meter
   reading
   is entered through the work order application. The checkbox is

   the
   Primary Reading Entered checkbox is still checked even though an
   asset
   hasn? been selected
   
   9. The Primary Reading Entered checkbox remains checked even

   asset without a meter is selected
