ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installing WMB 8.0.0.1 fix pack causes Transformation
   Perspective within toolkit not to work and throws exception
   errors.
   
   Now WMB 8.0.0.1 toolkit is calling launcher.bat file and not
   mb.exe as in 8.0.0.0. WMB Toolkit is now running 64 bit
   libraries because of the running of launcher.bat file on Win 7
   and WIN 2008 R2 64 bit OS. This causes Transformation
   Perspective which is still 32 bit to fail to work properly.
