QUESTION
 How do you get and install new WebSphere MQ (WMQ) 7.0, 7.1, 7.5 or IBM MQ 8.0 Client jar files for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI)? 

CAUSE
To use the WMQ Adapter, the WMQ Suite Services, and/or the WMQ File Transfer Edition Services in ISBI a set of MQ Client jar files needs to be installed.
ISBI installation (version 5.2.3 and higher) includes WMQ Client jar files version 7.0.1.6.
The WMQ Client jar files version 7.0.1.6 can be used to connect to MQ Server version 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and presumably future versions.
Only WMQ Client connector.jar (required when using WMQ Client jar files version 7.0, 7.1 or 7.5) is not automatically available and can be installed following the description in IBM Technote "Get and install WebSphere MQ Client v7.0.1.6 connector.jar for Sterling B2B Integrator" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21690721].

Please note 

 * WMQ Client jar files version 7.0.1.6 cannot be used on Java 7 (see IC88187 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC88187]).
   Thus at least version 7.0.1.10, 7.1.0.3, 7.5.0.1 or 8.0 is needed when running ISBI 5.2.5 (that requires Java 7) or ISBI 5.2.4.2 on Java 7. 
 * connector.jar is no longer needed when using IBM MQ Client Lib jar files version 8.0 (see IBM MQ 8.0 Knowledge Center "Changes to IBM MQ classes for Java" [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q115900_.htm]).


If MQ Client jar files needs to be updated for ISBI, this Technote outlines the procedure. 
ANSWER
Ensure that all other versions of MQ Client jar files have been uninstalled (see IBM Technote "Uninstall WebSphere MQ Client jar files from Sterling B2B Integrator [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21690573]") prior to installing MQ Client jar files. 


The required MQ Client jar files can be obtained: 

 1. either from an existing MQ server or MQ Client installation  * they are located in <mq-inst>/java/lib/*.jar
    
    
 2. or via download included in a MQ Client Install Image on IBM Support: Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%2FWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+MQ&release=All&platform=All&function=textSearch&text=client+install+image]  * if you choose an MQ Client Install Image for Windows please install the MQ Client and get the required MQ Client jar files as described in option 1. above 
     * if you choose an MQ Client Install Image for Linux you may extract (also on Windows) the required MQ Client jar files without installing as listed below  * in example, download: mqc8_8.0.0.2_linuxx86-64.tar.gz 
        * from the downloaded .tar.gz file, extract /MQSeriesJava-8.0.0-2.x86_64.rpm 
        * from this .rpm file, extract /opt/mqm/java/lib/*.jar (you can use rpm2cpio [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-lpic1-v3-102-5/#N1047F] or 7zip for extraction) 
        * from the downloaded .tar.gz file, extract: /MQSeriesRuntime-8.0.0-2.x86_64.rpm 
        * from this .rpm file, extract /opt/mqm/java/lib/*.jar (you can use rpm2cpio [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-lpic1-v3-102-5/#N1047F] or 7zip for extraction)
       
       
    
    


At least the following MQ Client jar files need to be copied to a temporary directory accessible on the server where ISBI is installed (for example, to: <mq-jars-tmp>/*.jar):  * com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar 
 * com.ibm.mq.headers.jar 
 * com.ibm.mq.jar 
 * com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar 
 * com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar 
 * com.ibm.mqjms.jar 
 * connector.jar

Note  * connector.jar is no longer available and needed when using IBM MQ Client Lib jar files version 8.0 (see IBM MQ 8.0 Knowledge Center "Changes to IBM MQ classes for Java" [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q115900_.htm]


To install the MQ Client jar files change on command line to the folder <si-install>/bin and execute:  * on Linux/UNIX 
   ./install3rdParty.sh ibm_mq <version> -j <mq-jars-tmp>/*.jar 
 * on Windows 
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm_mq <version> -j <mq-jars-tmp>\*.jar


Restart ISBI for the changes to take effect.
