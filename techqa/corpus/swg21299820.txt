PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are experiencing a problem with User Interfaces: Commands and Traces with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB).

This mustgather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support.


ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris systems.
Return to the WebSphere Message Broker MustGather index [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Consider Troubleshooting [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au09090_.htm]
 2. Dealing with problems [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au16510_.htm]
 3. 
 4. Check for known issues:
    [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/tserver/support/]WebSphere Message Broker support site [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Message_Broker]
    



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. mqsidc See: mqsidc usage instructions [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fbu46012_.htm]
    
    
     * This command line tool is only available for WMB 7.0.0.5+, WMB 8.0.0.1+, and IIB 9.0.
     * When running the tool, select the option for 'Broker Collector', when prompted.
    
    
 2. 
 3. Traces  * Utility trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21461066] (for failing mqsi commands)
     * A service level trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg21177321#2] will capture the processing of the object of the failing mqsi command. 
    
    
 4. 
 5. General Broker information
    If the mqsidc tool was not run, then capture this information manually  * Record the WebSphere Message Broker version, release, and maintenance level.
       This can be captured using the command 'mqsiservice -v'.
     * Record the operating system version, release, and maintenance level.
     * Record the version, release, and maintenance level of any related products and components for the problematic application.
     * Collect the local error log. On UNIX and Linux systems, the local error log is the syslog. The location of your syslog is configured in the syslog daemon.
       See: Configuring the syslog daemon [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an04230_.htm]
     * Collect the Standard Output/Error logs.
       WMB writes information to both STDOUT and STDERR. These files are located under the Message Broker workpath.
       See: Standard System Logs [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fau14165_.htm]
     * Exact command that caused the problem
     * 
     * With your mqsi serviceID, collect the output of the command 'env'
     * Abend file(s) (if generated)
       Some runtime failures cause an abend. The syslog (see above) will record the time and location of any *.abend files created, as a result. You can also manually check for abend files in the directory: {MQSI_WORKPATH}/common/errors
       See: Abend files [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14190_.htm]
    
    



 * ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
   When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:
   
   
    *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 
   
   
   
   

STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
