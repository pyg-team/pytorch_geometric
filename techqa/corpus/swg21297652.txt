PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have a CICS application that issues an EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD command. This command fails with a security violation, only for a certain set of userids. You are able to recreate the failure using the CECI transaction which reports RESP=NOTAUTH (equates to x'70') and RESP2=20. A RESP2 of 20 means the user's connection to their default group has been revoked. You disagree that the associated group is revoked. 

SYMPTOM
CECI VERIFY PASSWORD command receives RESP=70 RESP2=20.


CAUSE
REVOKE DATE=DECEMBER 31, 2070 was coded for the default group.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
RACF date handling: RACF interprets dates with 2-digit years as follows. 

(The yy value represents the 2-digit year.) 

If 70 < yy <= 99, the date is interpreted as 19yy. 
If 00 <= yy <= 70, the date is interpreted as 20yy.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Code a revoke date, for the default group, with a year that is greater than zero and less than 70. This is currently the way RACF resolves the Y2K issue. This will have to change at some time far into the future (before 2070) but for now it is the current implementation. See CICS APAR PK10796 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK10796] for additional background information on VERIFY PASSWORD.
