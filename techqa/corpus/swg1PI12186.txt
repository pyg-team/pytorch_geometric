APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION

   changes.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When replicating a mixture of CICS      *
   *                      online and batch changes to             *
   *                      non-recoverable files, a window exists  *
   *                      where changes from one are incorrectly  *
   *                      included with changes to the other with *
   *                      the potential for causing changes to be *
   *                      applied out of sequence at the target   *
   *                      resulting in apply errors.              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Classic VSAM to VSAM has the potential to mix non-recoverable
   changes from CICS TS and CICS VR which could result in changes
   lost or out of order.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been corrected to correctly separate the processing
   of non-recoverable changes occurring in CICS online and batch
   processing.
