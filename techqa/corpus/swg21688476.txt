 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am plannig to update to the new Apple Mac OS X, 10.10 Yosemite and would like to know if IBM SPSS Statistics will run successfully on this OS. 

CAUSE
OS Update

ANSWER
IBM SPSS Statistics (any version) has two issues to resolve before it will run on OS X 10.10: 

1. Download and re-install Apple Java 6

- After the OS upgrade is finished, Apple Java 6 no longer exists on their system. 
- The first time the user runs an application that relies on Java 6, the OS pops up a dialog box stating they've requested Java 6, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided (http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]).
- User must click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.
- User must open the Java DMG, then double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation.

2. Re-license Statistics

- We use Safenet Sentinel technology for licensing. Safenet writes hidden data somewhere on-disc for keeping track of licensing data.
- The OS X 10.10 upgrade process erases that hidden data. Attempting to run Statistics produces a licensing error and Stats does not start/run properly.
- Solution: Re-run the SPSS License Authorization Wizard, enter auth code again and complete licensing procedure.
- Statistics will now run normally.
