PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users receive an error when attempting to save a C&DS job that has a notification added. 

spssemgr.log: 

Mar 22 2013 13:15:45 [main] ERROR com.spss.mgmt.prms.ui.editors.PrmsClusterEditor - Saving Job
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
at com.spss.mgmt.common.ui.UIExceptionHandlingRunnable$RunnableWithContextWrapper.run(UIExceptionHandlingRunnable.java:150)
at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:121)
Caused by: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 15, in <module>
NameError: name 'RuntimeException' is not defined 

SYMPTOM
Customer is unable to save a Job that had a Notification added to it , Notification - email address or JMS subscriber. The same issue is seen when attempting to add a Folder Event Notification to an existing Folder. 


CAUSE
Errors in C&DS startup process:. 

01:14:26,210 INFO [NotificationStartup] Notification Service component directory: /opt/workbench/IBM/SPSS/Deployment/5.0/Server/components/notification
01:14:26,211 INFO [NotificationStartup] Notification Service providers directory: /opt/workbench/IBM/SPSS/Deployment/5.0/Server/components/notification/providers
01:14:26,211 ERROR [[/notification]] StandardWrapper.Throwable: java.lang.NullPointerException

and then a number of the following messages:

01:14:26,283 WARN [FileDirContext] Could not get dir listing for /opt/workbench/jboss-6.0.0.Final/server/default/tmp/vfs/automount5d484b9743264a48/peb-job.war-c08c388931445770/WEB-INF/lib
01:14:26,287 WARN [ManagerBase] Error reading /dev/urandom: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /dev/urandom (Too many open files)

ENVIRONMENT
C&DS 5.0 - Linux; Jboss

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Determined that the ulimit was set too low for the environment




Using command: ulimit -n 

After updating the value to 65535 for the 'cads_startup' user and restarting JBoss, customer is able to add Notifications to jobs / job steps and add Folder Event notifications to folders and save those jobs.
