[ERROR] [] [] BMXAA6421E - The system could not connect to the JDBC source: jdbc:sqlserver://;serverName=localhostexample; databaseName=MaxDB;portNumber=1433;integratedSecurity=false;The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "Only SSLv3 was enabled while com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3 is set to true".


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Shut down Websphere. 

Install the WebSphere hotfix to disable SSLv3 as per this link https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173] 

Download the Microsoft SQLJDBC driver hotfix from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/982512/ [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/982512/]. 

Since the filename sqljdbc.jar may be hard-coded in other code, rename the old sqljdbc.jar to sqljdbc.jar.old. 

Copy the sqljdbc4.jar into Maximo admin workstation (folder: .\maximo\applications\maximo\lib) 

Rename sqljdbc4.jar, then rename that to sqljdbc.jar. 

Rebuild Maximo EAR, deploy and restart the Maximo application server.
