APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After you change the Default Details UI client-side human
   service to a process in the web IBM Process Designer, you
   receive the following error when you try to view the instance
   details in IBM Process Portal:
   
   Error: The JavaScript in the "Init Data Change Support"
   (2025.e6675aeb-fe1b-4c1c-8578-fac5a15202dc) script task refers
   to an undefined variable or method. See your browser console
   for more information. Correct the JavaScript and try again.

LOCAL FIX
 *  To avoid this issue, disable the Process Portal performance
   optimizations:
   1. In a web browser, go to the WebSphere Admin console:
   https://<server>:<secure-port>/ibm/console [https://<server>:<secure-port>/ibm/console]
   2. From the left navigation tree, select Resources > Resource
   Environment > Resource Environment Providers.
   3. In the table, click Mashups_ConfigService.
   4. In the Additional Properties section, click "Custom
   properties".
   5. Click New.
   6. Type com.ibm.bpm.portal.disableCFJSAPIInvocation for the
   name.
   7. Type true for the value.
   8. Click Apply and then save.
   9. Restart the server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The "Init Data Change Support" script uses generic script
   injection to load a JavaScript file that is stored as a managed
   asset. The configuration of the require statement affects
   whether the functions defined in the JavaScript file are
   available to the script. In this case, the configuration does
   not make them available, which results in the error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that prevents the JavaScript exception after you change
   the Default Details UI client-side human service will be
   available in a future release of IBM BPM.
