PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
When connecting to DB2 from a CICS region, you receive message DSN2016I the connection of CICS to DB2 failed. If you signon to the CICS region and enter 'DSNC STRT', you receive: DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'00000E18' in module DSN2STOP. DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'00000BF2' in module DSN2STOP. The CSSL message accompanying the abend is DSN2025I THE ATTACHMENT FACILITY IS INACTIVE. You also receive an abend 04E with a return code 00C30007.

CAUSE
Two IEFSSNxx members were concatenated at IPL time. IEFSSN00 specified JES as the first entry. However, IEASYS had the SSN concatenation specified as SSN=(02,00) making DB2 subsystem initialization take place before JES.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure JES is the first entry in your IEFSSNxx parmlib member. In this case, after changing the concatenation to make IEFSSN00 first, and performing an IPL, CICS connected to DB2 with no problems.
