APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows 2008 64-bit OS and ITM 64-bit Windows OS Agent.
   
   Problem Description:
     Customer attempted to upgrade the NT 64-bit OS agent on Win
   2008 x64 and the deploy failed because MTEMS could not be
   shutdown (locked).
     Checked the provided log and Terminate Process was not
   attempted so MTEMS was still locked when rechecked 2 seconds
   later.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Install ITM 6.2.2 FP2 64-bit OS Agent on Win 2008 x64 using
   tacmd createnode.
     2. Signon on remote machine and start METMS
     3. Try to upgrade ITM.6.2.2 64-bit OS agent to latest fixpack.
     4. METMS will not shutdown and Remote Deploy updateagent
   fails.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Be sure MTEMS is not active when Remote Deploy is attempted or
   run upgrade in GUI mode locally and verify all ITM processes are
   shutdown before attempting the upgrade.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On Windows, the installation of monitoring components or agents
   may fail if the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services
   (MTEMS) is also running.  This affects both local or remote
   installations, pristine or upgrade.  This is particularly
   prevalent in installations done through Windows Remote Desktop
   or other virtual clients.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The behavior of the installer has been updated to terminate all
   running instances of the MTEMS before installation begins.
   
   APAR IV12881 does not support Windows 2000. The APAR uses
   taskkill.exe which is not available on Windows 2000.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0009
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The Windows taskkill command can be used to terminate running
   MTEMS processes before starting the installation. This can
   optionally be done remotely as long as administrator privileges
   on the remote system are enabled.
