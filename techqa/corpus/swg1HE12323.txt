LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Documentation needs to be updated to describe Anywhere label in
   the matters advanced search page to reflect the correct
   functionality. The Screen has options to select Matters,
   Interviews, Collections, Requests and Anywhere. When you select
   Anywhere, search is executed across only the four options
   specified - Matter, Interviews, Collections and Requests.
   Whereas you may expect the search to be executed across all the
   four options above as well as other aspects like hold notices
   and notice titles. The documentation does not clearly identify
   the limited scope of the Anywhere option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A Technical document describing the corrections is published and
   can be accessed here
