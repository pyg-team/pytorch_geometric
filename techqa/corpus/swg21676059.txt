QUESTION
 Is it possible to retrieve IBM Content Collector for SAP (ICC4SAP) files that were stored in IBM Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) by using the CMOD ARSDOC GET retrieval command? 

CAUSE
 ICC4SAP stores more than just the raw document. It also stores data in a different manner when compared to how the CMOD ARSLOAD command stores data.

Each program uses different API's when storing an item, which require a matching API when retrieving the item. For this reason, to retrieve items stored with ICC4SAP in CMOD, the ICC4SAP API is required.

ANSWER
It is not possible to retrieve data that was stored with ICC4SAP using the CMOD ARSDOC GET command.
