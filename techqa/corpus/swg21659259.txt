Title: IBM Downgrading with new features enabled might cause the appliance to enter Fail-Safe mode - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An appliance with a license that is enabled for a feature that did not exist in an earlier release might enter Fail-Safe mode when it is rebooted after a firmware downgrade. This problem can occur if you downgrade to firmware release 5.0.0.8, 4.0.2.13, 4.0.1.17, or to an earlier fix pack release for these versions. 

CAUSE
Earlier 5.0.0, 4.0.2 and 4.0.1 firmware releases improperly handle a valid but unrecognized feature license. The appliance might enter Fail-Safe mode if this condition is encountered after a firmware reload or reboot.
The problem is corrected in 5.0.0.9, 4.0.2.14, and 4.0.1.18 under APAR IC92270.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the feature license is not enabled, a firmware downgrade does not cause the appliance to enter Fail-Safe mode. Therefore, before you downgrade to 5.0.0.8, 4.0.2.13, 4.0.1.17, or to an earlier fix pack release, first disable all feature licenses that do not exist in the earlier release. 


To recover from the problem, use the "boot switch" command to revert to the firmware version where the license is supported. Then, contact IBM Support for a special tool to remove the license before downgrading lower than the earlier firmware. 

Note: Direct downgrading (except the Roll-back/boot switch) to lower major releases such as 6.0.1.x to 6.0.0.x is not supported. The only supported downgrade of a major release is to reinitialize the appliance to factory settings. See this related technote for details on performing the reinitialization.
