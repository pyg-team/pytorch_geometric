Title: IBM Unable to open file into SPSS for Windows from MS Excel or MS Word. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Sometimes I get an error message in SPSS that says "A sharing violation has occurred while accessing <path and filename>" whenever I try to read a file from another application, such as MS Excel, or I get a message that says 

"Error 1216: A file cannot be opened. Probable causes are an attempt to open a read-only file for output, a directory which is too full, an invalid file specification, the specification of a nonexistent disk, etc. This command not executed." When I try to open the file from MS Word. 

Why can't I read my data? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Applications like MS Excel or MS Word will not allow SPSS for Windows to read a file if that same file is open in the other application. The solution is to close the file out of that other application before opening the file in SPSS
