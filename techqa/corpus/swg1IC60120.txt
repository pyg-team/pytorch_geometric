PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker        *
   *                 Version 6 or later deploying MessageSet or   *
   *                 Jar file artifacts.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When MessageSet objects or Jar files    *
   *                      are deployed to an Execution Group      *
   *                      while they are in use there is a        *
   *                      window where the deploy can conflict    *
   *                      with the running flow resulting in a    *
   *                      deadlock in the case of messagesets,    *
   *                      or a zero length file being deployed    *
   *                      on the broker filesystem in the case    *
   *                      of Jar Files.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When deploying an MRM MessageSet object or a Jar file the
   Broker is unable to determine in advance which, if any,
   currently running flows are using the resource. As a result it
   is possible for the flow to require access to the resource
   before the deploy has been committed but after the database or
   file system resource has been overwritten. This can result in
   the Broker becoming unresponsive and issuing a BIP2066
   exception in the case of MessageSets and zero length Jar files
   being written to the filesystem accompanied by BIP4510
   exception being issued indicating a ClassNotFound exception in
   the case of Jar files.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been updated to take a lock on
   all flows in the ExecutionGroup while deploying MessageSet
   or Jar file artifacts thereby avoiding the concurrant
   usage which lead to the locking problems.
