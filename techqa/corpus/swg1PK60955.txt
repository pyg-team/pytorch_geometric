   If there are two shareable DOs, DO1 and DO2, here are the
   possible scenarios and resulting winkin order:
   
    o DO1 is shared and DO2 unshared: DO1 would be winked-in,
   regardless of whether DO2 is newer or older than DO1.
   Above technote explains that a shared DO is preferred for
   winkin over  an unshared one.
