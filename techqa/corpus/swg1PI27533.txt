APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 Test
   Environment is installed into IBM Rational Application Developer
   (RAD), then RAD will automatically creates WAS 7.0 server
   runtime
   environment with an empty runtime name upon entering a new
   workspace.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   ----------------------
   1) Install RAD 9.1.0.1 and WAS 7.0 Test Environment server;
   2) Launch RAD v9.1.0.1;
   3) Allow "Runtime environment and profile settings" wizard that
   appears on RAD startup to create runtime/profile; specify
   required settings and click Finish
   
   Expected results: a new server runtime named "WebSphere
   Application Server v7.0", and profile will be created in the
   workspace; Actual results: a new server runtime is created, but
   does not
   have a proper name.
   
   The root cause is the default server runtime environments names
   are not being set properly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To workaround the issue:
   1) When the "Runtime environment and profile settings" wizard
   appears for configuring the WAS 7.0 server, ensure "Add
   WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 configuration to the
   workspace" is unchecked.
   2) Manually add the WAS 7.0 server runtime environment by
   navigating to Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime
   Environments > Add.
   
   NOTE: if you opt to create a profile during the installation of
   RAD & WTE, the workaround above may not apply.
