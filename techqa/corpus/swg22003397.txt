 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities in Open Source Apache CXF affect IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Note: CVE-2017-3156 has been added as an additional CVE that is supported via this bulletin. If you have already installed this fix before, you are not required to install again. 
CVEID: CVE-2016-6812 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6812]
DESCRIPTION: Apache CXF is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the FormattedServiceListWriter() function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the 'matrix ' parameter in a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
