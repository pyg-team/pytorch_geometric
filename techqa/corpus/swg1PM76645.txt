APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is running MQ 7.0.1.7 on AIX 6.1 which
   is connected to MQ V7.1 Z/OS 01.13.00 (new upgrade).
   They upgraded from from MQ 7.0.1 on the z/OS side.
   SDR side is using ccsid 500
   RCVR side isusing ccsid 932
   .
   SDR channel fails to start.
   AMQ9002: Channel 'MYCHANNEL.CSQ1' is starting
   AMQ9503: Channel negotiation failed.
   AMQ9999: Channel program ended abnormally.
   .
   MQ AIX trace shows
   xcsCCSIDCompatible rc=xecX_W_INCOMPATIBLE_CCSIDS
   .
   However, customer was able to use these CCSID before MQ
   V7.1 for Z/OS.
   .
   The change team has taken a look at the doc for this and
   they can see the cause of the problem. The customer already
   has the service parm set that should allow a sender on a
   ccsid 932 queue-manager to start with a receiver on a 500
   queue-manager. However, at V710 there is a problem with the
   code for performing the SBCS conversion in this situation
   (when xcsLocateAndTranslate invokes CSQALOCT to load the
   SBCS conversion table it should have set the xcsCCSIDTYPE
   info for the from/to codepages as this is now expected by
   CSQALOCT).

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CSQX541E is seen, invalid CCSIDs for    *
   *                      data conversion, when trying to start a *
   *                      channel between queue managers whose    *
   *                      CCSIDs are DBCS and SBCS.               *

   ****************************************************************
   A circumvention is available that can be implemented under the
   Change Team direction to allow queue managers to run channels
   with this mixed DBCS/SBCS arrangement.
   
   This circumvention enables a conversion of the channel name,
   say, using the SBCS part of the mixed CCSID and the target CCSID
   (or SBCS part, if the target queue manager has a mixed DBCS/SBCS
   CCSID). So for example, provided the conversion is supported, a
   queue manager in CCSID 932 will use the SBCS 897 part of the
   DBCS and conversions will take place between this and the target
   CCSID. (If the conversion is not supported, CSQX541E will be
   seen and this is expected.)
   
   However, there is a problem with the code for performing the
   conversion between the SBCS part and target CCSID in
   xcsLocateAndTranslate that causes CSQX541E to be seen even when
   the code page conversion is supported.
   
   Once the SBCS part of the DBCS CCSID has been identified the
   translation table is looked for with a call to CSQALOCT.
   However, xcsLocateAndTranslate is passing the xcsCCSIDTYPE info
   for original DBCS CCSID and not the SBCS part to CSQALOCT.
   Therefore CSQALOCT detects that the two CCSIDs are incompatible
   as no such translation table exists.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  xcsLocateAndTranslate has been changed to specify the correct
   xcsCCSIDTYPE info (i.e. for the SBCS part for a mixed CCSID).
