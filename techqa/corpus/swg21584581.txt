Title: IBM EnablePassword ignored on remote agent during SAP test execution - United States

Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) playback on a remote agent is requesting the SAP user and password. 

SYMPTOM
For SAP Shortcut to not prompt the user for the password during execution, you need to set the EnablePassword registry key. For that, you would do the following steps.



Disclaimer This solution contains information about modifying the system registry. Before making any modifications to the Microsoft Registry Editor, it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of the existing registry. For more information describing how to back up the registry, refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base article 256986 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986]



 1. Open the registry.
    
    
 2. Go toHKEY-local-user\software\sap\sapshortcut\security.
    
    
 3. Set variable EnablePassword to 1.




You have to do that configuration step, even if RPT SAP extension has the credentials information as part of the test, 

You started the IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent on your remote agent under the Local System Account. 
It can happen that RPT playback requests the SAP credentials, even though you have done the above registry settings on the agent.

CAUSE
 

When appending the registry change for the SAP shortcut password prompt, possibly only your Windows account can *see* that registry change.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You could decide to start the agent manually as a process under the same windows account where the PasswordEnable change is appended.


How to start the agent manually on the remote agent depends on the RPT versions.




From versions 8.2 to 8.2.1.5 (including)


 1. Stop the IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent service with
    
    Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services.
    
    
 2. Start a command prompt window.
    
    
 3. Change directory to the Agent Controller bin folder, for example, 
    
    C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\AgentController\bin.
    
    
 4. Start ACServer.exe. This starts both ACServer.exe and TPTPProcessController.exe.
    
    


Versions 8.3 and newer


 1. Stop the Majordomo service with
    
    Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services.
    
    
 2. Start a command prompt window.
    
    
 3. Change directory to the Majordomo installation folder, for example,
    
    C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\Majordomo.
    
    
 4. Start Majordomo.bat.
