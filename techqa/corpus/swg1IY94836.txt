APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The probe receives sometimes an event of type
   "AlarmPropagationList", and this appears to be a kind of
   container for other alarms.
   
   
   At the moment, the probe creates one alert for it, and the inner
   alarms are created as tokens.
   
   Lingxian (alcatel canada) need to confirm fix
   
   CUSTOMERS OBSERVATION:
   alarm-97 and alarm-249 are presented in the event list.
   
   Please ensure that this APAR resolves this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid using this event type.

   ****************************************************************
   Current behaviour: the probe is missing incoming events,
   because it creates one OS alert per AlarmPropagationEventList
   received from the SAM server. Required behaviour: the
   AlarmPropagationEventList is in fact a container, which stores
   several alarms. So, there should be one OS alert per contained
   alarm.
