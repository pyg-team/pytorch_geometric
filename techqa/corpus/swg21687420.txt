Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Tivoli Management Framework provides packages to replace the Cygwin bash in the Tivoli Endpoints. - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014 (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278). This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities.

Tivoli Management Framework uses Cygwin Bash in TMR Server, Managed Node, Gateway 
only in Windows Operating Systems. 

On demand, TMF may ship Bash binaries, to Endpoints running in Windows Operating systems.

The Bash version that TMF bundles is 1.14.1(19) that is in the list of the versions affected by the vulnerability, however the Bash binaries that TMF bundles are a subset of the whole Bash set and they are copied into internal TMF products directories not accessible by an external untrusted user, so TMF is not vulnerable. 

By default, the Bash binaries are not downloaded in the Endpoint sites, They are downloaded only
if the customer explicity changed the dependency set of some Endpoint method (ie: run_task) or
uses IBM Tivoli Monitoring product (ITM). 

Although TMF and ITM usecase scenarios are not exposed to Bash vulnerability, some customers 
required to replace the bash in their endpoint sites, so TMF will ship two Interim Fixes to provide replacement packages for Cygwin bash in the Endpoint sites.
