QUESTION
 What support does Rational ClearQuest provide for organizations wishing to comply with NIST SP 800-131A guidelines? 

CAUSE
 US. Government organizations might be required to support NIST SP 800-131A guidelines http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.pdf [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.pdf]. These guidelines place certain restrictions on the types of cryptographic algorithms that are used in application deployments.

ANSWER
If your organization must comply with NIST SP 800-131A guidelines, the following ClearQuest deployment configurations can help with compliance. 


 * Deploy ClearQuest version 8.0.1.1 or later. 
 * Configure ClearQuest to use enhanced cryptographic algorithms as recommended by the FIPS 140-2 guidelines. See FIPS 140-2 Approved Data Encryption. [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v8m0r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.clearquest.admin.doc%2Ftopics%2Fc_fips140_2_data_encrypt.htm&resultof%3D%2522%2546%2549%2550%2553%2522%2520%2522%2566%2569%2570%2522%2520] 
 * Host ClearQuest Web Server on an IBM WebSphereÂ® Application Server (WAS) that has been configured to support the NIST SP 800-13A guidelines. See Configuring WAS for SP 800-131 Strict Mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.nd.doc%2Fae%2Ftsec_config_strictsp300.html] and Configuring WAS for SP 800-131 Transition Mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.nd.doc%2Fae%2Ftsec_transition_sp300.html] . There is also a Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest technote that explains more about configuring WAS for NIST SP 800-131A. See Configuring TLS 1.2 in IHS and WAS for CCRC and CQ [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648276]. 
 * ClearQuest LDAP authentication is used for conforming to the FIPS 140-2 guidelines. The connection between ClearQuest and the LDAP server should be configured to use a high level of the TLS protocol as recommended in the SP 800-131 guidelines, and as specified by your organization. See Configuring CQ for TLS1.2 or TLS1.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21646724]. 


The following information can help you determine whether your ClearQuest deployment conforms to the NIST SP 800-131A guidelines:  * ClearQuest cryptographic keys adhere to a minimum key strength of 112 bits for FIPS 140-2 conforming deployments. 
 * ClearQuest does not provide digital signature capability as defined by the guidelines. Use of the ClearQuest eSignature package does not conform to the guidelines of a digital signature since it is not using digital certificates. The eSignature package should not be applied. 
 * ClearQuest uses an approved Java random number generator.
