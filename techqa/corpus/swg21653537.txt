Text:
INSTCONFFAILED code 137 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 BBOWWPFC fails with return code 137 in step runCollectNodeMetadata during profile creation, and message
INSTCONFFAILED: The profile could not be created. For more information, consult the ....../DeploymentManager/logs/manageprofiles/default_create.log file.


The default_create.log shows:
......../DeploymentManager/profileTemplates/cell/dmgr/actions/collectNodeMetadata.ant:80: exec returned: 1


CAUSE
Missing libraries in LPA, LINKLIST, or STEPLIB

ENVIRONMENT
z/OS

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the default_create.log file to see if there are any other indications as to why this might have failed. If there are no other obvious explanations, check to make sure that you have all required libraries in LPA, LINKLIST, or in STEPLIB.




See the Chapter titled "Preparing z/OS to run WebSphere Application Server" in the InfoCenter for information about the required libraries. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the missing libraries (in one case it was SCLBDLL2) either to LPA, LINKLIST, or add a STEPLIB statement.
