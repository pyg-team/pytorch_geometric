   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When invoking REST API to search query
   does
   not return all active instances waiting on IME.
   Example:
   In a BPD like:
   START -> SYTEM LANE ACTIVITY 1 -> IME -> PARTICIPANT LANE
   ACTIVITY
   Start the BPD and Run the Execute Query API for active
   instances:
   /rest/bpm/wle/v1/search/query?condition=instanceStatus%7CActive&
   organization=byInstance
   Note that the active instance will not be listed here.
   When a process is waiting on an IME, there is no associated
   open task and no assigned user and search queries in this case
   filter based on a user. &#130; &#160; So, nothing is returned when
   searching for active instances when an IME has the token.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem was fixed in an interim fix.
   
   Install/Dependency information is available in the readme.txt
   on FixCentral. When the user goes to the download files page
   in FixCentral, the readme will be available with the fix
   package as a separate download.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  A possible workaround in the short-term is to use the
   web-based Process Inspector. &#130; &#160; If you go to Process Admin,
   click Process Inspector, then check the Active box under Status.
