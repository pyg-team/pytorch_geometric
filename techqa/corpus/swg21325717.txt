QUESTION
 I am using the "gvim" editor as my default editor and when I open a file for editing, it is empty. How can I resolve this? 

ANSWER
In the case of "gvim", it is necessary to add the "-f" switch before %filename. Otherwise, an empty file may be displayed. The entries in the .ccm.ini file would then be as follows: 


text_editor = gvim -f %filename 
text_viewer = gvim -f %filename 
Cli.text_editor = gvim -f %filename 
Cli.text_viewer = gvim -f %filename
