QUESTION
 Why am I not able to install fix pack? 

CAUSE
Having different version of installer and a component

ANSWER
Sometimes the installation fails by throwing the following error messages:


1) GYMCI9023W - No differences were found between desired topology state and current state of proviso installation. 

2) GYMC19036E - Unable to perform installation because the host computer is not included in the model defined in the topology.xml 
file. 

We get similar error message while we are installing a fix pack on a server which has different component version and different component installer version. 

 

For example:
Application Component Version Build Registration Date 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DL SNMP.4.20 4.4.3.3.8 App Ginger.265.30; Lib Ginger.2010.09.24 03:40:10 
INST Dataload.HNPROVISODL1 4.4.3.2 00 2009.11.08 14:28:56 

In the above example, it is clear that DL of version 4.4.3.3.8 and it's INSTaller of version 4.4.3.2.
In this case if you try to install 4.4.3.3-TIV-PROV-IFXXXX then it would fail with the above error messages.

We probably got in to this situation because of one of these reasons:
We installed 4432 DL using a 4433 deployer
We installed 4433 DL but decided to back it down to 4432.

Please note there are lots of other reasons for fix pack failure and this one of the important reason to consider.


We need to do one of these to resolve this issue::
1) Upgrade the DL installation to 4433 (./deployer -DTarget=DLU -DUsehostname=x [and we will have to do it on each DL host]) (Recommended)
2) Modify our INST DL registration entry so it is 4432 and request IBM for 4432 fix.
