QUESTION
 After I reboot my Windows server running JazzSM, the WebSphere Application Server server does not start. 

IBM support told me it was necessary to manually add the start server in Windows. I did not find this documented anywhere in the Jazz for SM users guides nor does it seem like something the user should have to do. The AboutMyProfile.txt shows that there is no service in Windows to start WAS. 

Q: Is this done by design in Jazz for SM?
Q: What is the method by which Jazz for SM expects the WAS server to start? 

CAUSE
During development discussions the Tivoli Integrated Portal (TIP) installer team provided feedback that they receive a considerable number of PMRs related to problems upgrading when a Windows service is automatically created to restart the WebSphere server. This was one of the reasons to not include this capability in the design.

ANSWER
JazzSM does not create Windows service to restart the WebSphere server but a user can create one by using our CLI after JazzSM is installed. 

If the customer would like to, they can create one by referring to the following technote: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674568 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674568]
