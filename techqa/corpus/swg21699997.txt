ENVIRONMENT

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When attempting to use License Authorization Wizard (Utility), the text and dialog boxes appear too small to read/use. Text size may also be too small for other programs or operating system components.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For Windows 7 operating systems see the following Microsoft article: 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/make-the-text-on-your-screen-larger-or-smaller?v=t [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/make-the-text-on-your-screen-larger-or-smaller?v=t]

For Windows 8.x operating systems see the following Microsoft article: 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/make-text-screen-larger-smaller/?v=t [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/make-text-screen-larger-smaller/?v=t]






For Windows 10.x: 
(1) Select 'Start'.
(2) The cursor should default to the 'Search programs and files' text dialog box.
(3) Type the following: magnifier
(4) Press the Enter key on the keyboard. 
(5) Use the Magnifier program to read the text in the License Authorization Wizard.

If the above adjustments do not correct the problem, the product can be licensed without the License Authorization Wizard graphical user interface in the following manner:

(1) Select Start.
(2) Open an Administrator Command Prompt. 
(a) In 'Search programs and files' text dialog box, type the following: cmd
(b) Press and HOLD the Control (ctrl) AND Shift keys on the keyboard.
(c) Press the Enter key. An Administrator Command Prompt window will open.
(d) Release the Control and Shift keys.
(e) Provide administrator credentials if prompted and/or respond to User Account Control prompt.
(3) Type the following into the Administrator Command prompt replacing '<VERNUM>' with the two-digit version number of the product (e.g. '24'):

cd \Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\<VERNUM>\

(4) Press Enter.
(5) Type (copy/paste) the following: licenseactivator
(6) Press the space bar one time.
(7) Type (copy/paste) the product license authorization code (e.g. 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h1a2b).
(8) Press the Enter key.

IF the 'licenseactivator' program has been executed with Administrator privileges AND the product host machine has access to the SPSS Licensing Servers , THEN you should receive a response message including the response 'Successfully processed all codes'. 

IF the 'licenseactivator' response does not include 'Successfully processed' all codes, THEN the most common causes are:

(A) An Administrator Command Prompt was not used to execute the procedure;
(B) The local Administrator account does not have full read/write/modify authority to on the product host.
(C) The product host does not have network access to the SPSS Licensing Servers (lm.spss.com).

To test whether the product host has network access to the SPSS Licensing Servers, perform the following procedure:

(1) Open an Administrator Command Prompt.
(a) Select Start.
(b) In 'Search programs and files' text dialog box, type the following: cmd
(c) Press AND HOLD the Control (ctrl) key on the keyboard.
(d) Press AND HOLD the shift key on the keyboard.
(e) Press the Enter key on the keyboard. An Administrator Command Prompt window will open.
(f) Release the Control and Shift keys.
(g) Provide administrator credentials if prompted and/or respond to User Account Control prompt.
(2) Type the following command: nslookup lm.spss.com

IF you DO receive a response that includes 'Non-authoritative answer' and 'Aliases: lm.spss.com' THEN the host device CAN access the SPSS licensing servers.

IF you do NOT receive a response that includes 'Non-authoritative answer' and 'Aliases: lm.spss.com' THEN the host device can NOT access the SPSS licensing servers.
