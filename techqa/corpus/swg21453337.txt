 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Cast Iron Studio, receiving the error “Internal error: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException” while trying to verify an orchestration



CAUSE
One of the possible reasons for this issue could be that the volume of data being processed by the orchestration is large for Studio. 

The Studio ‘Verify’ option must be used for basic testing of orchestration using a small data-set. Processing a large data-set will exceed Studio memory limits which may result in an error or abnormal studio behavior.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, verify the orchestration with a small data-set or run the orchestration in appliance runtime. If the problem persists, submit a service request to Cast Iron support.
