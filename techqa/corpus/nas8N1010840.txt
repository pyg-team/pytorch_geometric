RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document explains how to completely remove Omnifind. 

To completely remove Omnifind, you should do the following: 

1. Shut down the server: 

a. Issue the qsh command. 
b. cd /QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/TextSearch/serverX/bin 
c. Issue the shutdown.sh command. 2. Clean up catalog files (not required, it is only required when you want the clean environmental). Note: This should be executed before uninstall because the script and the program in product directory are necessary:

RUNSQLSTM SRCSTMF('/QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/TextSearch/resetOMF.sql') COMMIT(*NONE) NAMING(*SQL) 3. Uninstall by issuing the following command:

DLTLICPGM LICPGM(5733OMF) 4. Verify library QDBTSLIB does not exist. Delete it if it exists. 5. Manually remove IFS directories (some directories will be preserved during the uninstall) (not required, it is only required when you want the clean environmental):

a. Issue the qsh command. 
b. rm -r /QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/TextSearch

To reinstall after that cleanup, you should do the following:

o Issue the RSTLICPGM LICPGM(5733OMF) DEV(Install device) command.
o Install all the existing PTFs before going through the setup steps in the Omnifind doc which can be located at the following URL:
