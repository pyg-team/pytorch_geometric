Title: IBM Default logs directory setting changes in sandbox.cfg does not move all log files to the new directory - United States

STERLINGNFX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Default logs directory setting changes in sandbox.cfg does not move all log files to the new directory 

SYMPTOM
When modifying the file 'sandbox.cfg' to set the parameter LOG_DIR to a new location and running 'setupfiles', the following log files are still written to the old location: 

SyncEngine.log
UCCnet22.log
UCCnetEdition.log
access.log 
einvoicing.log
jetspeed.log
jetspeedservices.log
torque.log
turbine.log

Error Message
None recorded


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two distinct groups of logs included in the list that are not affected by the change to the 'sandbox.cfg' file. 

The first group consists of 'jetspeed.log', 'jetspeedservices.log', 'torque.log', 'turbine.log', and 'access.log'. These logs are part of the services that make up the Dashboard interface. In order to affect the location of these logs, we must re-deploy the WAR files that make up the Dashboard. To do so, run the command 'deployer.sh' (Unix) or 'deployer.cmd' (Windows). This in turn also 
runs 'setupfiles', so there is no need to run it again. 

The second group consists of 'einvoicing.log', 'SyncEngine.log', 'UCCnet22.log', 'UCCnetEdition.log'. These are not actually part of the logging sub-system in GIS, but are actually Service Configurations that create log files. To modify the location for these logs, the path must be modified in the Service Configuration. The log and corresponding configuration are below: 

einvoicing.log: eInvoiceLogger
SyncEngine.log: SyncEngineLogger
UCCnet22.log: UCCnet22Logger
UCCnetEdition.log: UCCnetEditionLogger
