Title: IBM Capturing SQL error codes from exception list - United States

Text:
SQL error codes capture filter obtain SQL error codes exception list TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You need to know how to capture the SQL error codes from an exception list in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To filter the SQL errors from an exception list following a compute or database node error: 

 * Connect the fail tab to a new compute node 
 * Add ESQL that is similar to the example given below to the new compute node


You can either send the error information from this node to an output node or process further the error information in this node (or another compute node), to filter for certain SQL error codes for example.
