APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In order to enforce a 'one connection per client' rule, you need
   to be able to control the opening of TCP/IP connections by the
   HL7DFDLInput node. This is not possible unless the
   TCPIPServerInput node's 'open' and 'close' terminals are exposed
   in the HL7DFDLInput node.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Connection testing can be done using TCPIPServerInput nodes.
   The logic can be transferred to the HL7DFDLInput node later.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack who need to
   manage their TCP/IP connections for HL7 applications in ways
   that are not supported by the TCPIP configurable service
   parameters.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If you want to enforce a 'one connection per client' rule, there
   is no means of intercepting the connection attempt via the
   'open' terminal of the TCPIPServerInput node, because that node
   is hidden within a subflow UDN ( the HL7DFDLInput node).
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Two extra terminals have been provided on the HL7DFDLInput node,
   wired directly to the open/close terminals of the internal
   TCPIPServerInput node.
