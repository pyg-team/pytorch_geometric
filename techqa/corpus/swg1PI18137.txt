APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This applies to Portal installations with multiple independent
   profiles sharing the same Portal/WAS binaries. (See InfoCenter
   documentation for "Creating and maintaining multiple profiles
   on
   Linux")
   The PortalServer directory MUST be writable when configuring
   the
   first profile. Secondary profiles are sometimes configured
   without write access to the Portal binaries. In this case the
   secondary profiles will fail to complete the profile update
   step
   of the CF process.
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Mount the portal binaries as read/write for all profiles.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This applies to Portal installations with multiple independent
   profiles sharing the same Portal/WAS binaries. (See InfoCenter
   documentation for "Creating and maintaining multiple profiles
   on
   Linux")
   The PortalServer directory MUST be writable when configuring
   the
   first profile. Secondary profiles are sometimes configured

   secondary profiles will fail to complete the profile update
   step
   of the CF process.
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Update secondary profiles with -DSharedBinaries=true parameter.
   For example:
   ConfigEngine.sh CONFIG-WP-PTF-CF -DSharedBinaries=true
