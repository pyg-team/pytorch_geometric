APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We need to raise a docs apar for the message bus gw to include
   versions of JMS we support
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ/omnibus/gat
   eways/xmlintegration/wip/general/xmlgw_summary.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ/omnibus/gateways/xmlintegration/wip/general/xmlgw_summary.html]
   as it currently does not list what version of JMS we support
   
   we gave them the following details earlier but we need to be
   specific on what we support in the docs guide
   
   ==============
   The gateway, or rather, the transport module was written using
   JMS 1.1.
   Some target applications apparently only support 1.1 (eg,
   activeMQ for
   instance).
   
   ==============

   ==============
   
   Here was the official statement from L3
   
   The gateway, or rather, the transport module was written using
   JMS 1.1.
   Some target applications apparently only support 1.1 (eg,
   activeMQ, I
   believe). So one way of looking at this question is to ask if a
   target
   that supports v2.0 can also support communications from an
   application
   written using v1.1. I'm not familiar with TIBCO EMS but I would
   be
   surprised if the answer was 'no'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the Gateway for Message Bus.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The Gateway for Message Bus Reference Guide needs to state   *
   * which version of JMS is supported.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The updated guide will be uploaded to the Netcool/OMNIbus    *
   * Knowledge Center during December 2015.                       *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following note will be added to Transport Module section of
   the following topic:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ/omnibus/gat
   eways/xmlintegration/wip/general/xmlgw_summary.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ/omnibus/gateways/xmlintegration/wip/general/xmlgw_summary.html]
   
   Note:
   The gateway supports Java Message Service (JMS) API 1.1 and
   target applications that use later versions provided they
   maintain backward compatibility as currently expected by the JMS
   specification.
