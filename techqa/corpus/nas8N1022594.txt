Either of the above will do the necessary commands to delete all associated objects.


If you try to do it using RMVDIR '/QFPNWSSTG/<nwsstg>', you first need to 1) UNMOUNT and 2) delete the corresponding UDFS file that was added to the object structure in IBM i OS r7.2:

1) UNMOUNT TYPE(*UDFS) MNTOVRDIR('/QFPNWSSTG/<nwsstg>/MOUNT')
2) RMVLNK OBJLNK('/dev/QASP0x/<nwsstg>.UDFS') [where x is the ASP number]
