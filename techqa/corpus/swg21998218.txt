 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to TM1 10.2.2 FP6 a Windows Security Prompt to select certificates is displayed when using IBM CAfE 10.2.2 FP6 against a SSL secured TM1 Applications Web. 

SYMPTOM
Windows Security Prompt in IBM CAfE

CAUSE
IBM CAfE 10.2.2 FP6 uses TLS 1.2 to establish a secured connection to the TM1 Application Server. When the TM1 Application Server configuration is not compatible with TLS 1.2, this security prompt is present.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM CAfE 10.2.2 FP6



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There can be multiple configurations leading to this scenario, all in relation to the SSL configuration not allowing TLS 1.2 - possible examples below: 

 * the Signature Algorithm of the certificates is not compatible with TLS 1.2 
 * SSL configuration has been performed by adjusting the server.xml, not allowing TLS 1.2 as sslProtocol (ie. sslProtocol="SSLv3,TLSv1,TLSv1.1")
