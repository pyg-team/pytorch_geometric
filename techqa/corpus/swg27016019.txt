Note: If you have CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 or higher, you will no longer need SupportPac CA8K because CICS provides support for Atom feeds within the base code. See Atom feeds from CICS [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.internet.doc/topics/dfhtl_atom_serving.html] in the CICS TS V4.2 information center for more details.
