Title: IBM Error 7001 for network license just began occurring - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error 7001 on our network license just began occurring after using Statistics for some time. We are using the same License Manager server and the Sentinel License Manager service is running. I do not see any license now under the License Manager server in WlmAdmin, the Sentinel Server Administration. Why don't I see the license in WlmAdmin and how can I fix the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The lock code on the License Manager server may have changed. Run echoid to find the current lock code on the License Manager server. Go to C:\Program Files\Common Files\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel RMS License Manager\WinNT (default installation path for the Sentinel License Manager). Find echoid.exe and double-click on this file. In the window that opens note the lock code. Also get the authorization code for the version that you are using. This is the twenty character long code that was used to license the application. Submit a Service Request for assistance on this to IBM SPSS Technical Support, by going to IBM_Support_Service_Requests [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Open_service_request]. Please include the exact error number and symptom that you are getting along with the lock code and the authorization code.
