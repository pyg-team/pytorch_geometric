Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How is client logging, also known as Trace logging, performed for IDM Desktop when connecting to a Content Services server? 

ANSWER
Turn on logging 

 1. Run IDM Trace. 
 2. Select these options.  * Enable Tracing 
     * Enable System trace logging 
     * Enable SQL trace logging
    
    
 3. Click on OK.


Generate log 

 1. Run Filenet Neighborhood, IDM Find, or the IDM application for which logging needs to be generated. 
 2. Perform the specific action to be logged. 
 3. Retrieve the log. It is named fndslog.txt and is located at \filenet\idm\temp.


Additional comments 

 * The size of this file is not regulated and can get very large. It is recommended that logging be turned off for normal operations. 
 * The fndslog.txt file can be deleted at any time. If logging is still turned on, a new log file will be generated as needed. 
 * The workstation does not have to be reset after changing Trace options. However, if an IDM application is already running, it does need to be restarted. 
 * Trace logging cannot be used if connecting to an Image Services server.
