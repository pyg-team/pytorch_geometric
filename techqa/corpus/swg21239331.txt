PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to troubleshoot SSH connection to WebSphere® DataPower® appliance 

CAUSE
Ensure that the SSH service is enabled and, if an Access Control List (ACL) is being used, that the IP address of the client is allowed access in the ACL.

ENVIRONMENT
The DataPower appliance requires an interactive process to protect credentials during the SSL handshake. The DataPower appliance initiates a secure channel and provides for an encrypted login process.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First, ensure SSH is enabled:



 1. Login to the WebGUI as an administrator 
 2. Click Network 
 3. Expand Management 
 4. Click SSH Service 
 5. Click Admin State enabled
    

Next, while still on the Configure SSH Service page, check the ACL. The Access Control List field will either be "(none)" indicating no IP address restrictions are set, or the field will display the name of a previously configured ACL. If one is configured, click the "..." button to edit the ACL and ensure that the IP address of your client is allowed access. As a quick test, you can change the value of the ACL to "(none)", which will remove any IP address restrictions on the SSH interface. Save any changes made to the SSH service configuration.
