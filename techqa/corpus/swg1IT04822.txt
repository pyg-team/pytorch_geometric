LOCAL FIX
 *  A firmware upgrade can be completed successfully by refraining
   from establishing additional SSH sessions to the appliance
   during the upgrade process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MessageSight V1.x appliance
   who are attempting to perform a firmware upgrade on a system
   where "WebUI" type user accounts in the "SystemAdministrator"
   group have been created, and those user accounts have been used
   to establish SSH sessions to the appliance CLI during the
   upgrade process.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   After applying MessageSight APAR IT02532 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT02532] (shipped with fixpack
   1.1.0.1), it was still possible for a firmware upgrade to fail
   due to an unsuccessful attempt to copy a sparse relating to user
   accounts. Specifically, this issue can be encountered when
   additional SSH sessions are established to the appliance while
   the upgrade is in progress.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The underlying platform services components of the IBM
   MessageSight appliance firmware have been updated to allow
   specific files to be ignored during upgrade. This prevents the
   copy attempt of the sparse file during the firmware upgrade
   process.
