QUESTION

Using Lotus Domino, I want to limit the size of messages for various groups of people using server mail rules.

How can I use server mail rules to limit the message size from various groups?

ANSWER

Scenario:

- 5 administrators with no size limits.
- 150 managers with a limit of 5MB.
- 2000 users with a limit of 2MB. 

Because of limitations in the size of mail rules (15K per rule and 64K overall), it will not be possible to define rules for each individual. 

Solution: 

1. Add an organizational unit (OU) of Admin for the 5 administrators and an OU of Manager for the 150 managers. 

2. Create the following mail rules: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3. These rules work on the premise that the address is in Lotus Notes canonical format. If we set the parameter SMTPTranslateAddresses=2 on the inbound SMTP server, Internet addresses will be translated to their Notes hierarchical name during the SMTP process. Mail rules can then be applied using the Notes name.
