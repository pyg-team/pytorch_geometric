ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WHEN FILTERING WITH SUSPEND, RESTORE OR DELETE USER IN VIEW ALL
   REQUESTS, THESE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE LISTED. JAPANESE LANGUAGE
   This APAR is a result of ITIM 5.0 APAR, IZ74692 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ74692]
   Title: When filtering with Suspend, Restore or Delete User in
   View All
   Requests, these requests will not be listed. (LP issue)
   Problem Description:
   User installed Japanese language, then tried to list "Suspend
   User",
   "Restore User" and "Delete User" requests.
   They are correctly listed in View All Requests if he set
   "Request Type"
   to "All", however if he set "Request Type" to "Suspend User",
   "Restore
   User" or "Delete User", they aren't listed.
   Can Customer Recreate: Yes, and Japan L2 duplicated.
   ITIM Server Version - 5.0.0.8 with IF38
   Desired Behavior:
   Even if filter is used in View All Requests, appropreate
   be listed as the same as no filter being used.
   Steps to Duplicate:
   1) Install Japanese LP, and logon ITIM admin console in
   Japanese.
   2) Create a user
   3) Suspend the user
   4) Restore the user
   5) Delete the user
   6) List these operation through View All Requests using no
   filter (All).
     It works as expected.
   7) Set "Suspend User" to "Request Type" in View All Requests,
   then run
      the search, but the request isn't displayed.
   8) Set "Restore User" or "Delete User" to the filter, but they
   aren't
      displayed as the same as "Suspend User".
   9) Change the language to English, then do the same thing.
      With English, it works as expected.
