QUESTION
 What are the recommended number of Mailbox ODBC Connections and Delivery Threads (SCI21911) 

ANSWER
The ODBC and thread connections are dependent on number of processors. It is not recommended to increase those values beyond the number of processors on the machine. (It actually does no good - and can cause resource contention issues).

For example for a dual processor machine - you would set the Mailbox ODBC connections to 2 and the Message threads to 2. That way each message thread has an individual ODBC connection that can be used to connect to the database for simultaneous processing.

The thread count and ODBC connection counts should be set the same.
