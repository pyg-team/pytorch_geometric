ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Cognos servers are physically located in Germany GMT+0
   
          ??Russian users are located in Moscow Russia current
   timezone is GMT + 3 but on the 30/10/11 this will change to GMT
   +4 because of daylight saving. From now on Russia will stay in
   daylight saving time of + 4 for ever.
                                                      ?
   
         ?What will happen when the clocks change in April time
   will Cognos go back to GMT + 3 without daylight savings? How
   would Cognos handle this situation?    ??Service pack in
   Microsoft was issued to correct this on Windows, is there
   anything that needs to be applied on Cognos to change the
   settings from 'GMT +03:00 Russia, Moscow' to 'GMT +04:00 Russia,
   Moscow'? Should they have this setting applied for users who
   have now 'GMT +03:00 Russia, Moscow' or would then users need to
   select the timezone manually like 'GMT +04: 00 XXXXXX'?
