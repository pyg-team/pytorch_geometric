RN1.0; SRX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During long data collections for IBM Cognos Data Manager, a "Premature EOF" exception occurs in the WebSphere Application Server hosting the data service. 

CAUSE
The IBM Cognos Data Manager job runs slow enough to exceed the write time-out of the server, causing the WebSphere Application Server hosting the data service to time itself out and close the connection. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the write time-out for the HTTP inbound channel for the HTTP port of the data service: 

 1.  Determine the server and port for the data service being used for the collection by examining the URL in the XML data configuration file. 
 2.  Open the WebSphere Application Server administrative console for the WebSphere Application Server instance of the data service. 
 3.  Click Servers > Application servers. 
 4.  Click RationalInsightServer. 
 5.  Under Container Settings, expand Web Container Settings and click Web container transport chains. 
 6.  Click the transport chain for the port used by the data service. 
 7.  Click the HTTP inbound channel. 
 8.  Increase the length of the write time-out. This time-out value determines how long the WebSphere Application Server waits before attempting to write to a client stream. The default value is 60 seconds. 
 9.  Click OK and Save directly to the master configuration. 
 10. Stop and restart the Rational Insight WebSphere Application Server profile.
