Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Flex System V7000 systems are affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 and CVE-2014-0076) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91990 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Flex System V7000

All products are affected when running code releases V6.4.1, V7.1.0 or V7.2.0.


REMEDIATION/FIXES
For IBM Flex System V7000, install the following code levels or higher:


V7.2.0.5
V7.1.0.9
V6.4.1.9

Latest IBM Flex System V7000 Code [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004101]


After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160 

1) Replace your SSL Certificates 

Regenerate the system's private key and SSL certificate by issuing the command line interface (CLI) command "svctask chsystem -regensslcert". 

2) Reset User Credentials


Change all user passwords using either the graphical user interface (GUI) or by issuing the CLI command "svctask chcurrentuser -password". No action is necessary for session-related cookies.

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Ensure that all users who have access to the system are authenticated by another security system such as a firewall.
