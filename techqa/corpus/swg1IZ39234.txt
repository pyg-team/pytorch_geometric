APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Fault monitor entry will be inserted into /etc/inittab when we
   run ./db2fmcu command,
   Fault monitor entry should be deleted when we execute ./db2fmcd
   command.
   
   The problem is when we have a blank line immediately after fmc
   entry in /etc/inittab file, we were not able to delete the fmc
   entry (blank lines were not taken care).
   
   This caused problems during uninstall of TSM products.  This fix
   will take care of the blank lines in the /etc/inittab file.
