APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a stack where LDAP is set up as the authentication mechanism
   from the CMC ( with Authenticated Bind) , the set up works well
   for several days then starts to reject authentication requests.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Changing the password for the Authenticated Bind user in LDAP
   and providing the new password on the LDAP configuration of CMC
   should help resolve the issue temporarily.
   The other option is to restart the API Management Appliance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using IBM API Management with LDAP as the identity
   provider, after running normally for sometime , the API manager
   login fails with the LDAP user login.
   The problem was occurring due to an issue with connection
   pooling.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is targeted for inclusion in IBM API Management fixpack
   V3.0.0.1
