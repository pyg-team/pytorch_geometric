ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When switching between pages in a custom panel in DotEdit
   application, SaveData method passes in incorrect field value to
   the datafile
   
   - When I move from FirstPage to SecondPage, SaveData for
   FirstPage should
   be called using FirstPage's runtime XML.

   be called
   using SecondPage's runtime XML, followed by FirstPage's
   LoadData.
   - When closing DotEdit, SaveData for page currently displayed
   should be
   called with the displayed page's runtime XML.
