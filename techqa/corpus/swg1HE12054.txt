APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading to IBM Content Collector 4.0, editing a task
   route that contains a P8 Archive Email or P8 Find Duplicate
   Email task might cause the following error to be displayed:
   
   DataAccess.DataAccessException:ibm.ctms.datastorenet.exceptions.
   DataStoreExceptionNET: 'Failed to execute statement.' error
   details : { state : '40001' native error : 10006 message :
   'SOLID Database Error 10006: Concurrency conflict, two
   transactions updated or deleted the same row' }
   
   In addition, the following error message might be logged:
   
   Error DataAccess.DataAccessException:
   ibm.ctms.datastorenet.exceptions.DataStoreExceptionNET: 'Failed
   to execute statement.' error details : { state : 'HY000' native
   error : 10029 message : 'SOLID Database Error 10029: Foreign key
   constraint (R_MDSC_TSMP) violation, referenced column values do
   not exist.' }
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To work around the problem, create a new FileNet P8 connection
   set. Edit all affected task routes and change the P8 connection
   to point to the new connection set in all P8 Archive Email and
   P8 Find Duplicate Email tasks. Save the task route, then assign
   the original P8 connection set again and save again. You can
   delete the new connection set after fixing all task routes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a P8 Archive Email or P8 Find Duplicate Email task is used in
    a task route, upgrading the task route to IBM Content Collector
    4.0 might not work correctly. In some cases, the P8 connection
   is not updated correctly, which causes an error when saving the
   task route in Content Collector 4.0.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0 Fix Pack 3, P8
   connections are saved correctly in the P8 Archive Email and P8
   Find Duplicate Email tasks.
