Title: IBM Notice Sender Execution Failed Alert - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I receive a Notice Sender Execution Failed alert? 

CAUSE
The exception in the alert is "The timer task failed due to error : java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01691:
unable to extend lob segment PSSAPL.SYS_LOB0000082401C00013$$ by 8192
in tablespace PSS_USER"


ANSWER
This is due to low space in PSS_USER tablespace. 

You can ask your Oracle DBA to run the following select statement using an account that has SYSDBA privileges

select * from dba_lobs where segment_name='SYS_LOB0000082401C00013$$';

Based on the results, space can be allocated to the tablespace " PSS_USER" to avoid errors in Atlas application
