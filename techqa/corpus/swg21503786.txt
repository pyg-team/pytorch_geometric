 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is there a way with the available date related functions in Report 
Studio to filter a report to always use a start date of the Monday date
26 weeks in the past? 

SYMPTOM
Without this, the user would always have to select the date.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The attached report spec is a working example of the solution using the Cognos Samples GO Sales (query) at Public Folders > Samples > Models > GO Sales (query) in Cognos Connection. 

Make use of 4 data items to simplify the expression a bit:

The vale of X is 26 as an example. i.e. we want to always choose the Monday for the week 26 weeks past. 

Data item 1 Expression: ( 7 * 26 weeks = 182 days)
This expression will get the date for 26 weeks back (-ve sign). 

(_add_days(current_date,-182)) 

Data item 2 Expression:
This expression calculates if Dataitem1 is Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday.../Friday 

value 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday etc. 

( _day_of_week ([Data Item1],1)) 

Data item 3 Expression: (result Date) 

if ( (_day_of_week ( [Data Item1] , 1) ) <> 1 ) then ( [Data Item4] )
else ( [Data Item1] ) 

Data item 4 Expression:
This expression will go back if the 26 weeks back'th date wasn't a Monday. (e.g. if it was a Thursday, Dataitem 2 would have value 4, we go back 3 days (4-1) to get the Monday date. 

(_add_days([Data Item1], - ( [Data Item2]-1) )) 

The Dataitem 3 will return your resulting date (Monday for 26 weeks back).
