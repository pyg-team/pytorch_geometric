   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: xStream StreamException thrown when

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue here was as stated in the ticket that an invalid xml
   character was present in one of the show commands sent to the
   device and returned in the networkresourcedata object. When it
   tried to convert back from xml it threw a StreamException. I
   have changed the code to strip any non valid xml character
   before converting back from xml to fix the issue.
