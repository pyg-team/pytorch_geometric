   more server
   instances (called a "generic server" or a "cluster"), any one of
   which can run an application. The valid format is an
   alphanumeric string, with
   a maximum of 8 characters
   
   don't display the right value for this attribute at the moment
   and need to correct that. We are going to display the
   serverShortName from serverindex.xml which is the same as
   server_specific_short_name environment variable.
