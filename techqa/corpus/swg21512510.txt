Title: IBM Rational AppScan Source Edition can not integrate with LDAP using 'uid=' - United States

Text:
PM46716; AppScan; Source; LDAP; configuration; unable; authenticate; bind; uid; cn; RATLC02569414 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to configure IBM Rational AppScan Source Edition with an LDAP service that requires 'uid=' string (instead of 'cn=') fails, leaving LDAP users unable to authenticate with the Core server. 

SYMPTOM
In Rational AppScan Source Edition, you specify your LDAP settings in the LDAP Configuration dialogue and you observe the following: 

 1. With 'DN Bind' option checked, the OK button is inactive, so you can't validate your settings 
 2. With 'DN Bind' option unchecked, clicking OK closes the dialogue - but when you reopen the dialogue, you find that the settings have been altered:  * 'DN Bind' option is checked again 
     * 'uid=' is replaced by 'cn='
    
    
 3. When you create an LDAP user on the Core server and you try to log in as that LDAP user, the login fails and the logs show a message similar to the following:
    Unable to authenticate user to LDAP server; server <servername> port <port#> bind <cn=...>


CAUSE
This issue was identified as a product defect and logged under APAR PM46716.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

WORKAROUNDS: 

You can circumvent this issue with one of the following workarounds: 

 * Specify the entire string for the LDAP server in each user's definition on the Core server
   
   
 * Have the LDAP users authenticate with the Core server using their LDAP id in e-mail format
   
   For instance, you can create an LDAP user named "user.one" on the Core server and have that user log into the Core server as "user.one@your.domain.com" and his LDAP password.
   
   With LDAP id entered in this way, the the global authentication settings are not in force and the information is passed directly on to the LDAP server for authentication.
   
   This might be a preferable solution if users are used to entering this form of id when logging into different applications and services that use the same LDAP system.
