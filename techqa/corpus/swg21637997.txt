QUESTION
 When you attempt to run a scrypt tool file for license or component firmware upgrades, the DataPower appliance might return the following message:

% Reflashing firmware failed: (null)


CAUSE
DataPower appliances use the "scrypt" file format for both firmware upgrades and tools, for example, license upgrades and activators. The use of commands other than the "boot image" command, such as "reinitialize" or "boot reflash", with a scrypt tool might result in confusing error messages, and the system might not automatically reboot as required.

ANSWER
To run scrypt tools, always use the "boot image" command.
