ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At CICS TS 5.3 the version of ENCRYPTION=STRONG is equivalent
   to 5.1's ENCRYPTION=ALL and thus, the concept of a TLSv1.0
   ONLY parameter is no longer is available.
   .
   System SSL handles all the handshake protocol negotiation.
   These work by starting off with the highest level you support.
   Both sides support TLS 1.2 so the handshake tries to use that
   and then fails badly due to the defect in the other system.
   This prevents all handshakes from working.
   .
   At CICS TS 5.1 they used ENCRYPTION=STRONG which only supported
   TLS 1.0.  The other system said it supported TLS 1.2, we
   responded saying we only support TLS 1.0.  The other system
   then replies OK, and continues with a TLS 1.0 handshake and all
   works well
   .
   We need an option to allow TLS 1.0 only to continue to be a
   valid configuration option.

   ****************************************************************
   In previous releases, ENCRYPTION=STRONG used TLS 1.0 only. In
   CICS TS 5.3, this parameter has been deprecated and also had the
   behaviour changed to use TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. The replacement
   parameter is MINTLSLEVEL with value TLS10, TLS11 and TLS12.
   There is now no way to specify that CICS should only use TLS
   1.0. This may cause problems communicating with some other
   servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes to Sockets and Parameter Domain have been made to give
   CICS TS 5.3 the option to use TLS 1.0 only.
   A new option on the SIT parameter MINTLSLEVEL has been added
   called TLS10ONLY.
   
   The CICS Transaction Server for z/OS V5.3 System Defintion Guide
   (SC34-7428-00) has been changed on page 212:
   
   MINTLSLEVEL has had the new option TLS10ONLY added;
   
   TLS10ONLY Sets the TLS level to be TLS 1.0 only.
