APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the stylesheet cache is cleared via WebGUI or CLI command,
   e.g. "refresh stylesheet default *" and the appliance is serving
   requests via WSGW using these stylesheets, the firmware may
   restart. A workaround is to bring the relevant WS-Proxies down
   before clearing the stylesheet cache.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Quiese the WS-Proxy before clearing the cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customers using Web Service Proxy service may be affected.
   
   When a stylesheet being used by a WS Proxy service is cleared
   from the cache using WebGUI or CLI, and data traffic is being
   processed by the service at the same time, the firmware may
   reload.
   
   This is due to a programming error in handling the stylesheet
   cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Quiesce a WS Proxy service before clearing a stylesheet
   referenced by it from the cache. This is a recommended best
   practice anyway.
