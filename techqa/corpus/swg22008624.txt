 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Failure to configure an IBM Integration Broker (IIB) execution group with the mqsichangeproperties command line tool when attempting to configure the name of a WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX)/IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Resource Registry file (MRC). 

SYMPTOM
BIP2087E: Broker {BrokerName} was unable to process the internal configuration message.
and
BIP4041E: Execution group '{ExecutionGroup}' received an administration request that encountered an exception.


CAUSE
Any corruption in the MRC file (such as a Windows path on a Unix environment or any structural anomalies) can cause this failure.

ENVIRONMENT
Any execution environment where IIB is deployed where WTX/ITX is also deployed.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Search for the relevant error messages, and check the validity of the MRC file using the official Resource Registry GUI, part of the Design Studio installation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-create or repair the MRC file and retry the operation.
