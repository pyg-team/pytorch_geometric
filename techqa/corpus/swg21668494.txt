PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS_ITM-IF000x application support files on Windows fails because the prerequisite product is missing, even though 7.2 application support and agent are already installed on the same server. 

SYMPTOM
When trying to install 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS_ITM-IF000x application support files, you get the following error message at the beginning of the installation: 

The DVD you are trying to install is a fixpack DVD and cannot be installed on a machine without an existing image to upgrade

However the v7.2 application support (and agent) is already installed on the same server.


CAUSE
Possible mismatch of agent and application support installation images


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This has been a known issue since ITCAM for AD v7.1. The application support upgrade can only be done using matching images. 

 
The application support is delivered both on its own (part number CIC85EN) and along with TEMA (part number CIC82EN).

These images contain different license keys so they must be upgraded using the corresponding image. 

If you have installed the application support using CIC82EN, then you must upgrade using 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS_Windows-IF000x (as opposed to 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS_ITM-IF000x)
