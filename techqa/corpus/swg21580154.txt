SUMMARY
 Products bundled with an embedded IBM WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) or IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) are subject to a potential security exposure due to the Java HashTable implementation which can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) exposure when using Web based applications such as IBM Rational Build Forge or IBM Rational Automation Framework (RAF).

CVE ID: CVE-2012-0193 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0193] Description: IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.0 through 6.0.2.43, 6.1 before 6.1.0.43, 7.0 before 7.0.0.23, and 8.0 before 8.0.0.3 computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters. 

Review security bulletin 1577532: Potential security vulnerability when using Web based applications on IBM WebSphere Application Server due to Java HashTable implementation vulnerability (PM53930/PM57565) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577532] for more details. 

CVE ID: CVE-2012-0022 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022] 

Description: Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.34, and 7.x before 7.0.23 uses an inefficient approach for handling parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a request that contains many parameters and parameter values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4858 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4858]. 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
If your product was installed with the WebSphere Application Server or eWAS version 6.1 or 7.0 server that was shipped with your product, you are impacted by a security vulnerability which can cause performance or denial of service (DoS) issues.
Products deployed on Apache Tomcat 5.5.34 or earlier are impacted by this vulnerability which can cause performance or Denial of Service (DoS) issues.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
You are advised to read the instructions in this Interim Fix document linked below and update your application servers to correct this issue: 

PM53930: Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031821] 

 

If you are running Rational Build Forge 7.0.2.7, 7.1.2.2.1, or 7.1.3.0, or older releases in those streams, follow the directions directly. 

 

If you are running Rational Build Forge 7.1.3.1 or 7.1.2.3, install Tomcat version 7.0.23 (or later) instead of the noted 5.5.x as outlined in the note. The instructions are otherwise the same. 

 

Attempting to use Tomcat 7.0.x with Rational Build Forge installs that shipped with Tomcat 5.5.9 will result in a non-functional install.
