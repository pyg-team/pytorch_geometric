APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use the Document List control from the IBM Business
   Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.6 Content Management toolkit with IBM
   BPM V8.5.7, you see the message "Error retrieving documents" for
   a Document List coach control instead of the list of documents.
   
      The error 'Error Retreiving Documents' occurs is when using
   the Document List control for use with 'ECM Documents'. However,
   when it is configured to 'BPM Documents' this error does not
   occur.
   
   
      This is the tcp trace of the request and response for the
   servlet call to request the document.
