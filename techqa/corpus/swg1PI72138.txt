   for the Load Balancer for ipv4.
   
   Java is not updated with the Content Based Routing component
   or the Site Selector component.
   
   Java is updated on Solaris 64bit, Microsoft Windows and Linux.
   If your operating system is not at a supported level for

   load balancer maintenance.
   
   If using the https or ldaps advisors, the default cipher set
   is updated with java.
