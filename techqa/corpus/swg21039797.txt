PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive the following message during CICS initialization: 

DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control.

Language Environment is not initializing. 

CAUSE
Old COBOL libraries in the CICS startup JCL when running with LE/370.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The dump shows that an abend 0C4 is occurring in IGZCPSU on the CLI instruction at offset x'436' with Reg3 not valid. IGZCPSU is contained within load module IGZCEV5. The failing offset using the load module IGZCEV5 is x'3966'. Browsing IGZCPSU in storage shows the correct LE prefix CEE in the eyecatcher. 


The problem is due to having SYS1.COB2LIB and SYS1.COB2CICS in the STEPLIB or RPL concatenations. You should not have COBOL libraries when you are running LE/370. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove all references to SYS1.COB2LIB and SYS1.COB2CICS from your STEPLIB and DFHRPL concatenations.
