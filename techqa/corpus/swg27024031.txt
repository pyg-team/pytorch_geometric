CONTENT


This page describes the minimum product levels that need to be installed before opening a problem report with IBM WebSphere Portal Technical Support. The software versions and any maintenance levels listed on this page have been explicitly verified as working. 

EARLIER LEVEL OF A LISTED SOFTWARE: Software versions at a lower level than those noted on this page are unsupported. LDAP software at an earlier level is considered untested and best effort support only. For more details and exceptions, refer to the WebSphere Portal Support Statement [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/overview/inst_req_supt.html]. Also see the listing of software explicitly not supported for use with WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 in WebSphere Portal Support Statement Addendum - Unsupported Products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019552] (#7019552 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg27019552]). 

LATER LEVEL OF A LISTED SOFTWARE: Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are compatible with the tested versions. For more details and exceptions, refer to the WebSphere Portal Support Statement [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/overview/inst_req_supt.html].

UNLISTED SOFTWARE: Software not listed on this page at any level is unsupported. LDAP software not listed is considered untested and best effort support only.
