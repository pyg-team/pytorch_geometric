APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an exception occurs on the invocation path (sync or async
   invoke) for a OneWay operation, the FlowAction component will
   perform unmodelled fault retry (if configured).  After all
   retries (if any) have been performed, if the invocation path
   exception remains, the FlowAction component builds a fault SMO
   containing the unmodelled fault, and returns.  For an
   invocation using Callout, there is no response flow for a OneWay
   operation, and so no fault flow is invoked. The exception
   failure is not returned to the Mediation Flow.  Although the
   original cause of the exception is likely to have been logged
   in the SystemOut log or by FFDCs, the Mediation Flow should also
   be notified that the OneWay invocation has failed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of Websphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 or Websphere Process Server v6.2 who are     *
   *                 using OneWay operations using a callout.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: OneWay callout invocation exception     *
   *                      is not returned                         *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to ensure that the exception failure is
   returned to the mediation flow.
