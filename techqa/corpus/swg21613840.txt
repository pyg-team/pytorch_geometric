QUESTION
 What is the procedure to create a self-signed SSL certificate for Tivoli Integrated Portal via command line? 

ANSWER
The ikeycmd utility can be used to create a self signed certificate. Full details of the ikeycmd tool are available here:

ikeycmd setup [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPREK_6.1.0/com.ibm.itame.doc_6.1/ss7cumst48.htm]

Sample command for creating a self-signed certificate:

<TIP HOME>/java/bin/java com.ibm.gsk.ikeyman.ikeycmd
-cert -create -db <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/no
des/TIPNode/key.p12 -pw WebAS 
-size 1024 -dn "cn=MyHost.MyCompany.com, ou=My Company,
o=My Organization, c=US" -label MyCertAlias

After running the above command, restart TIP for the newly added certificate to be visible in the TIP certificate management portlets.
