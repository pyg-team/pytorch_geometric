APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  FIPS compliance information is not clearly stated in the
   WebSphere MQ Fixpack readme nor the WebSphere MQ Security
   manual.
   
   FIPS compliance depends upon the GSkit version, application
   type, type of connection and operating system.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   WMQ customers running Windows or UNIX who require FIPS 140-2
   compliant SSL connections for their channels.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Customers who need to use FIPS 140-2 compliant SSL connections
   for their channels were unsure as to whether their SSL was FIPS
   140-2 compliant.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For WMQ 6 on AIX, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris and Windows, the FIPS
   140-2 compliance of WMQ on these platforms is as follows:
   
   1. For all WMQ message channels (all channel types except
   SVRCONN and CLNTCONN), the connection will be FIPS-compliant if
   both of the following conditions are met:
   a. The installed GSkit ICC version has been certified FIPS
   140-2 compliant on the installed operating system version and
   hardware architecture
   b. The queue manager's SSLFIPS attribute has been set to YES.
   
   2. For all WMQ client applications (except Java/JMS applications
   using client mode), the connection will use GSkit and will be be
   FIPS-compliant if both of the following conditions are met:
   a. The installed GSkit ICC version has been certified FIPS
   140-2 compliant on the installed operating system version and
   hardware architecture
   b. SSLFIPS mode has been enabled on the client as described in
   Chapter 9 of the WMQ Clients manual.
   
   3. For all WMQ Java or JMS client applications which use client
   (not bindings) mode, the connection will use the JRE's SSL
   implementation and will be FIPS-compliant if both of the
   following conditions are met:
   a. The Java Runtime Environment used to run the application is
   FIPS-compliant on the installed operating system version and
   hardware architecture
   b. SSLFIPS mode has been enabled on the client as described in
   the WMQ Using Java manual.
   
   In general, all of the AIX, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris and Windows
   platforms are FIPS 140-2 certified except as noted in the readme
   file shipped with each fix pack or refresh pack.
   
   For SSL connections using GSkit, the component which is FIPS
   140-2 certified is named ICC. It is the version of this
   component which determines GSkit FIPS compliance on any given
   platform. Customers may run the gsk7ver command to determine the
   ICC version currently installed. Here is an example extract of
   the gsk7ver output relating to ICC:

   This information is to be added the FIPS section of Chapter 6 in
   the WMQ Security manual (topic sy11010_) to help customers
   determine whether they are FIPS-compliant.
   Furthermore, since 19th May 2007, the following DES-based SSL
   cipherspecs are no longer FIPS 140-2 compliant:
   TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   
   The SSL cipherspec tables in the manuals are to be amended
   accordingly.
