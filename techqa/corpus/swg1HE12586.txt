PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Some SMTP emails have exceptionally long header fail to be
   indexed by IBM Content Collector Content Search Searches
   Support.
   
   The following error will be thrown when these emails are
   encountered:
   
   AFUI0043E The document '{D564090C-AFDA-5F29-48F1-70E88EF8FACE}'
   (AFU7869508892813764958.eml) could not be processed as a
   regular email. Contact IBM Software Support.
   
   The issue is usually observed with auto-generated emails by some
   applications.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 FP5 release, internal
   SMTP header buffer length parameter has been made configurable.
   
   The internal default size is 2000. User can increase this value
   through Configuration Manager to 4000 or 6000 based on the
   requirement.
   
   Steps to change the SMTP header buffer size to other than
   default:
   1. On IBM Content Collector Server, Open Configuration Manager.
   2. Navigate to General Settings > Content Search Service
        Support > Support for Email > Custom Settings and custom
   attribute.
   
   3. Add the attribute as below.
   
        [Settings]
        *SMTPHeaderLen=<set the value to 4000 or 6000 here>
   
        For example,
    [Settings]
    *SMTPHeaderLen=4000
   
   4. On IBM Content Search Services server, restart the CSS
   service.
