QUESTION
 
Your Web Response Time (WRT) agent is capturing 3000 transactions per minute. In the TEP console, it takes over 30 seconds to populate the Transaction Details workspace. How can you improve this performance? 

ANSWER

Changing the value of the Data Range Hours property has a large impact on performance. This TEMA configuration property determines how many hours of data the agents keep on disk on the agent host.

The agent returns a full list, or searches that full list on occasion, depending on which workspaces you are viewing. 

Reducing that number improves performance in large-scale environments, because the agent doesnâ€™t have to search as many records. In most large-scale environments, IBM recommends setting Data Range Hours to 1. The default is 8.

Case Study

In one large-scale environment, the WRT agent monitors over 3000 transactions a minute in appliance mode. In this environment, it took over 30 seconds to populate the Transaction Details workspace using the default Data Range Hours setting. But, by changing this value to 1 and restarting the WRT agent, the WRT workspaces displayed data within 5 to 7 seconds.

Setting the Data Range Hours

Under Windows, Unix, and Linux, use the Manage Services GUI to set the Data Range Hours. Under Unix and Linux, you can also use the 'itmcmd config' command.

Using the Manage Services GUI

Use the Manage Services GUI to change the value of this property:

1. In the Manage Services GUI, right-click ITCAM for Web Response Time. 
2. Select Reconfigure.
3. Navigate to the Data Analysis Configuration tab.
4. Edit the value of the entry Number of hours to save data for viewing in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.
5. Save these changes and restart the WRT agent.

Using the 'itmcmd config' Command

Under Linux or Unix, manually configure the WRT agent from the command line.

1. Open a terminal prompt.
2. Change the current directory to ITM_HOME/bin.
3. Enter the following command:


 * 


4. Take the default when you are prompted to edit the 'Data Analysis Configuration' settings: 
 * 


5. Enter the Data Range Hours: 
 * 


Inspecting Value of Data Range Hours 

In the TEP console, use the Navigator tree to select Web Response Time > Configuration. Examine the Agent Details panel. Here, this property is identified as Data Range Hours. In the following example, the Data Range Hours property is the second property shown.

In the T5 .cfg file, the value of the Data Range Hours property is represented by the variable KT5SUMMARYINTERVAL. Do not edit this file. The WRT agent generates this file.
