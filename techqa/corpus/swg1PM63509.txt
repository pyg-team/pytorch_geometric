   -----------------
   Note: In this scenario, you know that you no longer want to
   carry out any inventory work at Toronto and so you know that
   you can remove the TORONTO queue manager from the cluster
   permanently. If you might want to reintroduce the TORONTO queue
   manager to the cluster within 90 days,issue the REFRESH CLUSTER
   command without the REPOS(YES) parameter:
   REFRESH CLUSTER(INVENTORY)

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 6 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Clusters manual describes how to    *
   *                      remove a queue manager from a cluster   *
   *                      in Task 10 of the Advanced Tasks.       *
   *                      However, it incorrectly states that the *
   *                      type of REFRESH CLUSTER command to be   *
   *                      issued is dependent on whether the      *
   *                      queue-manager is likely to be           *
   *                      reintroduced to the cluster within the  *
   *                      next 30 days. This value should in fact *
   *                      be 90 days and the Information Center   *
   *                      should be updated.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The description in Task 10 needs to specify a value of 90 days
   not 30 days when deciding on which REFRESH CLUSTER command to
   use, i.e. REPOS(YES) or REPOS(NO).
   
   Specifically in the following section
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.i
   bm.mq.csqzah.doc/qc12220_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzah.doc/qc12220_.htm]
   
   The text should look as follows:-
   
   8. Issue the REFRESH CLUSTER command
   
   Issue the REFRESH CLUSTER command to remove any auto-defined
   cluster channels: REFRESH CLUSTER(INVENTORY) REPOS(YES)
   Attention: In this scenario, you know that you no
   longer want to carry out any inventory work at Toronto and so
   you know that you can remove the TORONTO queue manager from the
   cluster permanently. If you might want to reintroduce the
   TORONTO queue manager to the cluster within 90 days, issue the
   REFRESH CLUSTER command without the REPOS(YES) parameter:
   REFRESH CLUSTER(INVENTORY)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Information Center has been changed to have the correct
   value.
