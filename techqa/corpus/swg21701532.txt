in Domain {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}


CAUSE
Group attribute and Group Search filter did not match


ENVIRONMENT
CPE 5.2.1
Oracle Directory Server Enterprise 11g R1




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In ACCE, validate Group Name Attribute and Group Search Filter are the same in the Directory Configuration 


Oracle Directory Server example: 
If "uid" is used in Group Name Attribute, the equivalent for Group Search filter should be: "(&(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(uid={0}))".
