Title: IBM WebSphere Business Events V7.0 installation fails to import the WebSphere Application Server - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Under some circumstances, the WebSphere Business Events V7.0 installation fails, reporting an error "The application server import failed". 

SYMPTOM
Two symptoms have been found: 

 1. The wbe_imwas_import.log contains a message similar to the following:
    Error getting file for installation: Failed to locate previously fetched file at /tmp/native/productproviders.xml_nd_7.0.0.200910291648.
    Error getting file for installation: Failed to locate previously fetched file at /tmp/native/im.properties_nd_7.0.0.200910290535.zip. 
 2. On Linux, the wbe_imwas_import.log contains a message:
    "The WebSphere Application Server failed to import. The install log was not created."
    It is likely that your system does not have libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 library, which is required by IBM Installation Manager V1.3.3, installed. To verify, perform a manual installation (command <WBE install directory>/wbe_bspace/im_repository/install) to see if you get an error messaging saying that libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 cannot be opened.

Note: The wbe_imwas_import.log can be found in the %temp% directory on Windows and in the /tmp directory on other platforms. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Symptom 1:
Follow these steps to get the installation to work: 

 1. Uninstall WebSphere Business Events V7.0. 
 2. Make sure that IBM Installation Manager is no longer showing WebSphere Application Server as installed. If Installation Manager is showing WebSphere Application Server installed, use Installation Manager to uninstall it. 
 3. Install WebSphere Business Events to a new location. Changing the case is not enough (that is, changing WBE70 to wbe70 will not work).


Symptom 2: 
Install libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 and reinstall WebSphere Business Events.
