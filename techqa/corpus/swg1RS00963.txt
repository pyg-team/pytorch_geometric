APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When executing in Rule Studio in French, a DVS Excel file
   pre-filled with decimal values in French (values using "," as
   the decimal separator), some errors are raised, stating that
   values with "," are invalid values.
   For example, we get error messages such as:
   * Valeur incorrecte (12,6) dans la cellule F10 de la feuille
   Excel Sc&#65410;narios. = Invalid value 12,6 in cell F10 of the Excel
   sheet Scenarios.
   * Valeur incorrecte (12,4) dans la cellule D14 de la feuille
   Excel Sc&#65410;narios. = Invalid value 12,4 in cell D14 of the Excel
   sheet Scenarios.
   
   This problem occurs when using decimal values written in a
   format that is not the Java format for numbers. In the Java
   format, numbers are represented with "." as decimal separator.
