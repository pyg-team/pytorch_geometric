PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install IBM Rational Developer for System z (RDz) v8.5.1.4 in the same package group as an existing IBM Rational Software Architect version (RSA) v8.5.5 fail with the "CRIMA1161E" or abort if you do not provide the location of the RSA v8.5.5 disk1 and disk3. 

SYMPTOM
Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Install RSA v8.5.5. with the default features selection without selecting the Extension for SOA and Web Applications which requires an additional license
    
    
 2. Remove the reference to the RSA v8.5.5 repository in the list of the available IBM Installation Manager (IM) repositories under the menu File > Preferences >Repositories
    
    
 3. Install RDz v8.5.1.4 with the default features selection.


Actual result:
You will be prompted to insert/browse to the location where disk1 and disk3 of the RSA v8.5.5 repository 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660020&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660020&aid=1] 
followed by the following dialog if the repository is not available: Problem Occurred: Failed to connect repository 'Y:\Install\Rational\Software Development Platform\RSA-RationalSoftwareArchitect\8.5.5\RSA\disk1' either because the repository does not exist, the repository is closed or the repository server cannot be reached. 

 

 *   *   *  [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660020&amp;aid=2] 
      
      
   
   

If you are performing the installation silently, the installation will fail and you will see the following error in the log. 

ERROR CRIMA1161E 09:12.89 Impossible to find required installation file

...

CAUSE
The RDz v8.5 repository ships the version 1.0.0.v20110712_2011 of the following plugins: 

 * 
 * 
   com.ibm.sca.cshelp.doc.feature
   com.ibm.sca.cshelp.doc.feature.nl1
   com.ibm.sca.cshelp.doc.feature.nl2
   
   com.ibm.sca.tools.cshelp
   com.ibm.sca.tools.cshelp.nl1
   com.ibm.sca.tools.cshelp.nl2
   
   com.ibm.rational.llc.ui.cshelp.feature
   com.ibm.rational.llc.ui.cshelp.feature.nl1
   com.ibm.rational.llc.ui.cshelp.feature.nl2
   


while RSA v8.5.5 ships version 1.0.1.v20120912_2323. 

There is no equivalent with RDz v8.5.1.4. 

Since the RSA v8.5.5 offering metadata requires version 1.0.1.v20120912_2323 for the above plugins and the repository of RDz v8.5.1.4 does not contain them, IBM Installation Manager will request the RSA 8.5.5 repository to be present during the installation of RDz v8.5.1.4 or will prompt for the RSA 8.5.5 disks. 
ENVIRONMENT
IBM Installation Manager v1.6.3.1 or higher



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SOLUTION 

 

 * Install RDz v8.5.1.4 first and then install RSA v8.5.5 into the RDz v8.5.14 package group
   
   OR 
 * Install RDz v8.5.1.4 and RSA v8.5.5 at the same time
   
   OR 
 * Create a common installation repository for RDz v8.5.1.4 and RSA v.5.5 using the IBM Packaging Utility
   
   OR 
 * Make sure that the repository of RSA v8.5.5 is available during the installation of RDz v8.5.1.4 if RSA v8.5.5 was installed first.
