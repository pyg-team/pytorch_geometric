ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Activation of locking even monitor can fail with SQL204 and
   SQL1619 if OPM objects were not cleared from the monitored
   database, if case the OPM server was killed or abnormally
   terminated during locking event monitoring initialization.
   The lock events are not collected anymore.
   .
   Fix: Locking monitoring component will do the necessary cleaning
   during initialization.
   .
   Possible errors in OPM Server traces:

LOCAL FIX
 *  Connect to the monitored database and drop the event monitors
   created by OPM, with names matching OPMN*.
   Drop unformatted event tables which names matching OPMN* created
   by event monitors, which belong to schema "OPM".
