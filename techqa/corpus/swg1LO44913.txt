   is different from 7.0/6.5.
   
   [Steps to Reproduce]
   
   1. Create new database.

   3. Create new view.
   4, Set the field created at "2." to the view's column.
   5. Open View Properties.
   6. Move to "Style" tab.
   7. Set "3" to [Height  (lines)] of [Rows] section.

   13. See how the data is displayed in the column of view when you
   let the width of column be narrow using Notes Client 6.5, 7.0,
   8.0, 8.5.
   
   [Result]
   
    E 6.0 & 7.0
   
     "A                          " is displayed as one word.
     So, if the width of the column is NOT enough for display the
   data, truncated data is displayed..
   
    E 8.0 & 8.5
   
     "A       " is displayed as one word.
     And, each character of  "                   " is displayed as
   independent word. So, if the width of the column is NOT enough
   for display "                   ", wrapped data is displayed.
