ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: The Monitoring Agent for Linux OS 6.2.3
   
    Problem Description: On Linux the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS
   reports metrics for NFS4 filesystems when the NFS feature is
   disabled (by adding  KBB_SHOW_NFS=FALSE in the lz.ini file).
   This issue occurs because the ITM OS Agent is not able to
   correctly detect NFS4 filesystems.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Linux OS Agent reports NFS4 filesystems when KBB_SHOW_NFS=FALSE
   int the lz.ini file.
   
   When the NFS feature is disabled by KBB_SHOW_NFS=FALSE, the
   Linux Agent continues to report metrics for NFS4 file systems.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to correctly detect NFS4 file systems.
   
   The fix for this APAR is going to be included in the following
   maintenance vehicle:
       | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0008
