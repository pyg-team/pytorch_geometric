 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 This techdoc provides all the necessary steps to help you monitor the queue SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT to audit the start and the stop for a MQ queue manager. 

CONTENT
First, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.


Second, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.
alter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)

Caveat:
If you want to have persistent messages in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue you will need to have discipline and a procedure to get and remove the messages, otherwise, the queue will eventually fill up.
