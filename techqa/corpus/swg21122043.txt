QUESTION
 What are the different connection switches/parameters which are available in the SQL Anywhere version 8 service which is used to host non-production IBM® Rational® test database in version 2003.06.14 and earlier? 

ANSWER
Important Note: Sybase SQL Anywhere bundling discontinued with Rational products 

Effective September 30, 2006, IBM® Rational® products will no longer include Sybase SQL Anywhere.

A SQL Anywhere service runs a SQL Anywhere database server with a set of command-line switches. When a client application connects to the database, the connection switches and parameters specify the characteristics of the connection.This is an example of creating a SQLAnywhere server to provide access to the Rational TDS database files and specify switches at a minimum:


-n service_name -c 6144 -tl 0 -ti 7200 -x TCPIP -gd all


The definition of these switches are:

-n SQLAnywhere_Server_name [name of server/service]
-c 6144 [set initial cache size]
-tl 0 [client liveness timeout in seconds (default is 120 seconds)]
-ti 0 [client idle time before disconnect (default is 240 minutes)]
-x TCPIP [Protocol in use].

Note: TCP/IP, SPX and Named Pipes are the only protocols supported. Novell NetWare is not supported for network servers. NetBios and IPX protocols are also no longer supported. Instead of NetBios, use TCP/IP or SPX. Instead of IPX, use SPX. 


-gd all [set initial permission level]


Not setting the -gd all parameter may cause inability to connect to the test datastore. Not setting the -ti and -tl parameters may result in a General Datastore Error when a connection is made to the datastore and then left inactive over a period of time. This can also cause problems when running tests overnight; IBM Rational TestManager can crash because the connection to the test datastore was lost.


The following is a complete parameters list and the their descriptions:



Server Switch Description @environment-variable Read in switches from an environment variable. @filename Read in switches from a configuration file. -? Display usage information. -b Run in bulk operations mode. -csize Set initial cache size. See -c command-line option. -ca 0 Disable dynamic cache sizing [Microsoft® Windows® NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/Me, UNIX®]. -ch size Set the cache size upper limit [Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/Me]. -clsize Set the cache size lower limit [Windows NT/2000/XP]. -cs Display cache usage in database server window. -ct { +| -} Turn character-set translation on and off [not NetWare or Windows CE]. -cw Enable use of Address Windowing Extensions on Windows 2000 and Windows XP for setting the size of the database server cache. -d Disable asynchronous I/O [Windows NT/2000/XP, NetWare]. -ecencryption-options Enable packet encryption [network server]. -ep Prompt for encryption key. -ga Automatically unload the database after the last connection closed. In addition, shut down after the last database is closed [Not NetWare]. -gb level Set database process priority class to level [Windows NT/2000/XP]. -gc num Set maximum checkpoint timeout period to num minutes. -gd level Set database starting permission. -ge size Set the stack size for threads that run external functions [not UNIX]. -gf Disable firing of triggers. -gk level Set the permission required to stop the server. -gl level Set the permission required to load or unload data. -gm num Set the maximum number of connections. -gn num Set the maximum number of concurrent requests the database server can handle at one time. -gp size Set the maximum page size to size bytes. option. -gr minutes Set the maximum recovery time to num minutes. -gss size Set the thread stack size to size bytes [not applicable to Windows]. -gt num Set the number of operating processors used by the database server. -gu level Set the permission level for utility commands: utility_db, all, none, or DBA. -gx Set the number of operating system threads assigned to the database server process. [Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/Me]. -m Truncate the transaction log after each checkpoint, for all databases. -n name Use name as the name of the database server. -o filename Output messages to the specified file. -os size Limit the size of the log file for messages. -p packet-size Set the maximum network packet size [network server]. -pc Compress all connections except same-machine connections. -pt size_in_bytes Set the minimum network packet size to compress. -q Quiet mode—suppress output. -qp Suppress messages about performance in the database server window. -r Opens database in read-only mode. -s Set the syslog facility ID [UNIX]. -sb { 0| 1} Specify how the server reacts to broadcasts. -sc Disable the shared memory port, and enable Named Pipes. [Windows NT/2000/XP]. -ti minutes Client idle time before shutdown—default 240 minutes [network server]. -tl seconds Default liveness timeout for clients in seconds—default 120 seconds. -tmf Force transaction manager recovery for distributed transactions [Windows NT/2000/XP]. -tmt milliseconds Set the reenlistment timeout for distributed transactions [Windows NT/2000/XP]. -tq time Set quitting time [network server]. -u Use buffered disk I/O. -ud Run as a daemon [UNIX]. -ut minutes Touch temporary files every min minutes [UNIX]. -v Display database server version and stop. -x list Comma-separated list of communication links to try. -y Run as a Windows 95/98/Me service [Windows 95/98/Me]. -z Provide diagnostic information on communication links [network server]. -zl Turn on capturing of the most recently-prepared SQL statement for each connection. -zo filename Redirect request-level logging information to a separate file. -zr { all| SQL| none} Turn on logging of SQL operations. The default is NONE. -zs size Limit the size of the log file used for request-level logging.
