Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Open Source Samba is used by IBM Netezza Host Mangement. IBM Netezza Host Management has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-12163 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12163]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak over SMB1. By sending specially crafted SMB1 data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause portions of server memory contents to be written to a file and obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132351 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132351] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2017-12151 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12151]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to properly sign and encrypt DFS redirects when the max protocol for the original connection is set as 'SMB3'. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to read and alter confidential documents.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132350 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132350] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-12150 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12150]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to require SMB signing in SMB1/2/3 connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to hijack client connections and obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132349 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132349] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-14746 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14746]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free memory error. By sending a specially crafted SMB1 request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135222 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135222] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-15275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15275]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a heap memory information leak. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain password hashes or other high-value data.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135221 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135221] for the current score

Execute below steps using "root" user on both ha1/ha2 hosts

Step 1. Check if Samba module is installed in the host
[host]# rpm -qa | grep samba

Step 2. Check if Samba service is running
[host]# /etc/init.d/smb status

Step 3. If Samba service is running, stop the smb service
[host]# /etc/init.d/smb stop

Step 4. Backup the /etc/samba/smb.conf file
[host]# cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf_backup

Step 5. Edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf and set following parameter as below:

client signing = required

Also add following parameter in global settings as below:

#============ Global Settings ==========

[global]
server min protocol = SMB2_02

Step 6. Start the smb services using below command:
[host]# /etc/init.d/smb start

Note : If samba configuration file smb.conf is changed/modified in future, please verify if above settings is changed. If changed please make sure to mitigate this issue by following steps 2 to 6.
