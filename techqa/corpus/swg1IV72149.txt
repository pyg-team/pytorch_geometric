APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The value of parameter "kd4.ira.maxMetricsRecords" specified in
   <ITCAM4SOA_Home>/KD4/config
   appears to have a relevant impact on the monitored node,
   especially for environments with huge loads of webservices. We
   need exhaustive documentation to clarify the following points:
   1) Tuning: We need to document the impact for
   "kd4.ira.maxMetricsRecords" in terms of
   - filesystem occupation on the SOA monitored node (higher
   values [e.g. 13200 = default] with big loads seems to consume a
   lot of space, why?)
   - historical collection of SOA metrics (lower values cause
   dropping of SOA metrics)
   2) Why we recommend to set its value to zero, is this page
   still valid?

LOCAL FIX
 *  Some minimal documentation can be found here:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696262 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696262]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The advice to set this parameter to zero was in error. We do not
   recommend altering the parameter from its default, as that may
   lead to loss of fault data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The recommendation to set the parameter to zero has been removed
   from the documentation.
