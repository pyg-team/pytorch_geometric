ANSWER
 

** Collecting SDMS Information with Trace ** 

Procedure to ENABLE tracing and capture data for SDMS 
1. Change the directory to following location 
* Windows : <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin 
* Unix : <ITM_Home>/<platform>/cq/Products/KD4/bin 

2. Run the kd4ChangeTraceLevel script with the -sa option: 
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -sa (Starts tracing always for SDMS) 

3. Restart the TEPS (for the new trace setting to take affect). 

4. Make sure that the current directory is the same as specified in step 1. 

5. Run the kd4ChangeTracelevel script with the -ra option: 
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -ra (Starts tracing for the current runtime) 

6. Allow the system to run for a minimum of 5 minues, and the reproduce the issue (problem). This will ensure that the trace includes a full interrogation of all agents. 

7. Collect and send the following information : From TEPS * Windows : 
<ITM-Home>/CNPSJ/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/trace*.log 
<ITM-Home>/CNPSJ/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/System*.log

* Unix :
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/trace*.log 
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/System*.log
