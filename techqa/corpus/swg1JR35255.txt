APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Changing the Target Service end point for an SCA module from the
   admin console> Applications> SCA Module > import/export>
   Binding> JAX-WS Target Service end point>  panel when the SCA
   module is up and running fails. Even though we change the target
   service end point to a new one and then restart the SCA module,
   it still points back to the old target service end point.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a work around, the user has to stop the SCA module, change
   the target service end point and then restart the SCA module.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Process Server users of JAX-WS    *
   *                  binding                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The change of JAX-WS target service     *
   *                      end point in administrative console     *
   *                      might not take effect.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When Service Component Architecture application is running,
   user changes JAX-WS target service end point in administrative
   console. The application is not restarted and this cause the
   change might not take effect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With fix, the running application will be restarted for change
   of JAX-WS target service end point and the change will take
   effect.
