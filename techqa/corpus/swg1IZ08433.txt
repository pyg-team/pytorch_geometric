ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Socket gateway does not shutdown after receiving a memory error.
   When the operating system resources are limited and the gateway
   is unable to get additional memory, it receives an IDUC error
   from attempting to connect to the object server. Instead of
   shutting down, the gateway continues to try to reconnect to the
   object server.
   
   The gateway not shutting down is a symptom of the larger out of
   memory problem. To prevent this issue, the operating system
   resources should be configured to provide the socket gateway
   adequate memory.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure the unix operating system to provide adequate memory
   for the socket gateway.
