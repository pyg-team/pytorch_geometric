APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using chunked encoding with HTTP compression, DataPower
   might incorrectly read the end of the transaction and be unable
   to process a following transaction, either reading in a request
   or reading in a response to the device.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For requests to DataPower, disable HTTP compression in the HTTP
   Front Side Handler.
   
   For responses to DataPower, disable HTTP compression in the
   Main tab in the Multi-Protocol Gateway or Proxy Settings tab
   in the Web Service Proxy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Incoming messages (from either front or backend) having
   "Content-Encoding: gzip" and "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" might
   corrupt subsequent request or response on the same persistent
   connection. All services that handle HTTP traffic are affected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.12, 6.0.1.8, 7.0.0.5 and 7.1.0.3.
