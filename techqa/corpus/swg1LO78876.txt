APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a plain text message with <pre> tags utilized is delivered
   to the device, the device will display exactly what it is given
   (as per design of the <pre>).  If the lines in the mail have
   been generated with many spaces on the end, those spaces are
   shown too.  When a person looks at the mail, it may look like it
    is just displaying the text in a narrower column rather than
   using the whole screen, but in reality, it is using the whole
   screen and you just can't see all the spaces that are there (but
    they really are there).
   Technically, this mail is being displayed as designed/correctly.
   That means that the real fix would be to fix whatever created
   the mail messages with spaces on the ends of the lines in the
   first place.  However, Traveler put in a workaround in APAR
   LO67629 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO67629] in a previous release to strip off the spaces at the end
   of lines in <pre> sections to avoid this display issue.  In
   fixing some other issues, this workaround was lost and is no
   longer in place.  This PMR is being used to open a new APAR to
   put the workaround back into the Traveler code.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Plain text mail using a pre HTML tag may show abnormally small
   on a mobile device.  This only happens if there is lots of
   whitespace characters included inside the pre tags.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Notes Traveler server has been updated to work around this
   issue and send content to the device in a way that will disply
   in a more readable fashion.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  This fix is included in Notes Traveler 9.0.1 IF4 and 9.0.0.1 IF5
   and all future releases.  For the latest Notes Traveler
   maintenance release information please see this technote:
