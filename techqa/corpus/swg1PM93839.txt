ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Shell projects cannot be referenced in an Inner Application by
   a
   relative path in the application-descriptor.xml. In 5.0.6 a
   shell
   project could be referenced like the following:
       <shell>
   
   <archive>..\..\components\CSXMobileShell-1.0.wlshell</archive>
       </shell>
   
   When the project is built the following error occurs:
   Initialization of build configuration failed: java.io.
   FileNotFoundException: The inner application 'CSXMobileStarter'
   could
   not be built because the shell component archive (..\..
   \components\CSXMobileShell-1.0.wlshell) was not found. Edit
   application-
   descriptor.xml to point to a valid shell component archive.
   Page 4 of 20
   
   In order to build a project an absolute path to the shell is
   neccessary, which is not feasible since the location of the
   file may be
   different from workstation to workstation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  change to absolute path
