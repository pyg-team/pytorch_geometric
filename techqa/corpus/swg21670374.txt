Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere MQ -  Potential denial of service when using the TCP listener (CVE-2014-0911) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A denial of service vulnerability exists and could affect customers using the TCP listener (inetd) on UNIX and IBM i platforms. This vulnerability does not affect customers using the MQ listener. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5401]CVE-2014-0911 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0911]
DESCRIPTION:
The TCP/IP listener (inetd) can be used with WebSphere MQ on UNIX and IBM i systems. A denial of service vulnerability exists and could be exploited by a remotely connected user to either create FDCs which could fill the file system, or cause the inetd process to enter an infinite loop consuming all CPU resources. This vulnerability does not affect customers using the MQ listener (runmqlsr).
