APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting UCD Blueprint Design Server as a Windows service does
   not generate any console log files such as stdout.out and
   stderr.out files that are equivalent to patterns.out and
   patterns.err files in C:\installation_directory\logs directory.
   Affected versions are up to UCD Blueprint Design Server 6.2.4.1.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1) Navigate to "C:\installation_directory\bin\service"
   2) Edit service.cmd file using your favourite editor and
   navigate to the below line.
   "%SRV%" //US//%SERVICE_NAME% --LogPath "%SERVER_HOME%\logs\" ||
   goto configFailed
   3) You must replace the above line with the following line.
   "%SRV%" //US//%SERVICE_NAME% --LogPath "%SERVER_HOME%\logs" ||
   goto configFailed
   NOTE: logs\" is replaced with logs"
   4) Open cmd with "Run as administrator" option and execute the
   following command.
   Let's say, the exising Windows service name for UCD Blueprint
   Design Server is ucd-bpd.
   sc delete ucd-bpd
   "C:\installation_directory\bin\service\service.cmd" install
   ucd-bpd
   5) Start UCD Blueprint Design Server from Windows service.
   6) Now, if you go to C:\installation_directory\logs directory,
   you should be able to see the following files.
   stdout_Today's DATE.log
   stderr_Today's DATE.log

   * As a result of this, unlike UCD BPD Server on Linux          *

   * log4j.properties file resides in C:\Program                  *

   * Files\ibm-ucd-patterns\logs directory.                       *
   *                                                              *
   * Start UCD Blueprint Design Server as a Windows service but   *
   * there is no patterns.out nor patterns.err files generated in *
   * C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd-patterns\logs directory. It would   *
   * be fine as long as console logs such as stdout.out and       *
   * stderr.out files are generated.                              *
   * But stdout.out and stderr.out files are *not* generated in   *
   * C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd-patterns\logs directory.            *
   * The root cause of the problem is that the service.cmd file   *
   * resides in "C:\Program Files\ibm-ucd-patterns\bin\service"   *
   * directory is wrong.                                          *
   * Run regedit and navigate to                                  *
   * Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Urbancode\Anthill3\UCD- *
   * BPD\Parameters\Log                                           *
