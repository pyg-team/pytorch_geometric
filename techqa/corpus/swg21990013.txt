 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I troubleshoot whether a plug-in gets loaded into an IBM Rational Rhapsody model? 

CAUSE
A user defined plugin does not appear to be available within a Rhapsody model.

ANSWER
To capture information as to whether a plugin plug-in is being properly loaded into Rhapsody, you can have a log file generated to gather data. Set the following variable within the rhapsody.ini file. 

JavaAPILogFile

Place this under the general section of the rhapsody.ini. For example: 

 * 
   [General]
   JavaAPILogFile=c:/temp/myLogFile.log
