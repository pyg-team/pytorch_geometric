Title: IBM DB2 JDBC driver is not licensed for connectivity by file db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar ERRORCODE=-4472 SQLSTATE=42968 - United States

Text:
ERRORCODE=-4472 SQLSTATE=42968; Db2 Connect jdbc jcc license db2jcc db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm trying to connect to a mainframe. I am new to JDBC connections. My java application fails with the following message. How do you locate or obtain the license jar file?

"[jcc][t4][10109][10354][4.7.85] The version of the IBM Universal JDBC driver in use is not licensed for connectivity to xxx databases. To connect to this server, please obtain a licensed copy of the IBM DB2 Universal Driver for JDBC and SQLJ.
An appropriate license file db2jcc_license_*.jar for this target platform must be installed to the application class path.
Connectivity to xxx databases is enabled by any of the following files: [db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar]. ERRORCODE=-4472, SQLSTATE=42968".


CAUSE
The JDBC connection checks to see if it is licensed to connect to the server by checking the CLASSPATH environment variable for db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar. If the correct license file is not listed in the CLASSPATH then the error is returned. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the error you must add the appropriate DB2 JDBC license file to the applications CLASSPATH environment variable. If you are connecting to a host (z/OS or iSeries) then you need to add the db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar file.

Where do I find the license file? 

The db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar file is included in all DB2 Connect server editions including DB2 Connect Personal Edition. The license is also part the IBM Database Enterprise Developer Edition. If you already have one of these products, then please use the license file from the DB2 Connect Activation CD. If you have a Passport Advantage account, then remember to download the activation key [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=71&uid=swg21305417] from Passport Advantage for the DB2 Connect edition that you have purchased. 

The db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar file is located in the /db2/license directory of the activation CD or activation file downloaded from Passport Advantage.

The license files for DB2 Connect products are not shipped with fix packs. Fix packs only contain a 90 day trial license for DB2 Connect and do not contain the license for the JDBC driver. Only the purchased product delivered on physical media (CD or DVD) or delivered from Passport Advantage contains the JDBC license that allows you to connect to a mainframe. 

I don't have a DB2 Connect product. Now what do I do?
If you do not have the file, then you must purchase a DB2 Connect product [http://www.ibm.com/software/dre/h2b/buildh2bpage.wss?synkey=D353924H03587T88] so that you may license the JDBC driver to connect to a mainframe. 

Note: If the Java application is being ran as a deployed JAR file, the error can also be encountered if the Class-Path header field in the manifest file, MANIFEST.MF, does not include the path of db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar
