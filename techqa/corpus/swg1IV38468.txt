ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ====================================================
   Severity: 2
   Approver: gdc
   Compid: 5724C04LN
   Release: 6.2.3
   
   Environment:
   The Monitoring Agent for Linux OS 6.2.3
   
   
   
   Problem Description: when a network interface is active and its
   cable is disconnected Linux OS Agent is not able to correctly

   ====================================================
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No Workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Linux OS agent does not detect a network interface status
   change due to a cable unplugged.
   
   
   The status of a network interface is reported by the Monitoring
   Agent for Linux OS in the Interface_Status attribute of the
   KLZ_Network group.  The status of a properly working Network
   Interface is indicated as UP.  When the network cable is
   unplugged the status is expected to become UP NOT RUNNING, but
   this is not occurring.  The status remains UP even if operating
   system commands like "ifconfig" or "ip addr" show it as no
   longer running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The status change is now being correctly detected and reported.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance package:
