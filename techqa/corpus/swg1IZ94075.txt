LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TBSM Data Fetcher connected to the portal server web service
   will return at most 100 rows of data.
   
   When the TBSM Data Fetcher requests data via the portals IBM
   Tivoli Monitoring Web Service, it requests the data and then
   must pull the result rows. This was hard coded as 100 rows and
   the interface between the data fetcher and the IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring Web Service was not designed to allow for scrolling.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM Tivoli Monitoring Web Service has been modified to
   return up to 32k rows.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
