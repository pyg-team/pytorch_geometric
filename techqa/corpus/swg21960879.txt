QUESTION
 When installing IBM Infosphere Data Replication engine on Oracle Exadata as Target, why am I required to select log reading mode and how to proceed past that and complete the install? 

CAUSE
Infosphere Data Replication engine for Oracle is designed to be used as both source and target engine. Hence during instance creation, you are required to provide details that are relevant to a source engine.

ANSWER
In the log reading mode selection screen, select any of the three options provided.
1. Local log reading
2. Remote log reading
3. Manual log shipping

If you have ASM, CDC will detect it and request ASM details. You can proceed after providing the same.
