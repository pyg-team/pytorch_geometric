CAUSE
The IBM Installation Manager (IIM) v1.5.x requires the GTK2 Operating System Software Package to be installed on Linux for System z, whether using the Interactive or Silent-mode.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the error, install the Operating System GTK2 Software Package which contains the libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 shared library. 

 

For example, the following Software Packages must be installed BEFORE attempting to execute the install binary-file for IBM Installation Manager v1.5.x on SLES 10 64-bit for System z (s390x). 

Note: IBM SLES 10 64-bit (s390x) for System z requires both 32 and 64-bit versions of the GTK2 package to be installed: 

 

 * 
 * Package name: gtk2-2.8.10-39.12.s390x.rpm 
   URL: https://www.suse.com/LinuxPackages/packageRouter.jsp?product=server&version=10&service_pack=&architecture=s390x&package_name=gtk2 [https://www.suse.com/LinuxPackages/packageRouter.jsp?product=server&version=10&service_pack=&architecture=s390x&package_name=gtk2] 
 * 
 * 
 * Package name: gtk2-32bit-2.8.10-39.12.s390x.rpm 
   URL: 
   https://www.suse.com/LinuxPackages/packageRouter.jsp?product=server&version=10&service_pack=&architecture=s390x&package_name=gtk2-32bit [https://www.suse.com/LinuxPackages/packageRouter.jsp?product=server&version=10&service_pack=&architecture=s390x&package_name=gtk2-32bit] 


Refer to the vendor of your Linux on System z Operating System (e.g. Novell or Redhat) to determine the name(s) of the Operating System GTK2 Package(s) that contain the libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 shared library. Then use the appropriate tool to install the Software Package(s).
