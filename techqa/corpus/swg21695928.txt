SUMMARY
 Two vulnerabilities are present in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition as embedded in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance. This issue was disclosed as part of the IBM SDK Java updates in October 2014. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566] 

DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections.

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The only remediation is to apply the following fix:

A previous fix for the IBM DataPower XC10 Appliance versions 2.1 and 2.5 provided protection from CVE-2014-3566, by making it possible to disable SSLv3 on the appliance. With that fix, it was still possible, although not recommended, to configure the appliance to use the SSLv3 protocol. 

Once the fix from the previous table is applied, the appliance can no longer be configured to support SSLv3 at all. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol, and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is to disable SSLv3. Verify that disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
