PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 By default, the Jazzâ„¢ for Service Management application server requires HTTPS access. You can set up the environment for both HTTP and HTTPS, however HTTP access is not supported. 

CAUSE
For security reasons, HTTP access is disabled by default and is not supported. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before you begin


After installing Dashboard Application Services Hub and before beginning this procedure, log in to the console to ensure that it has connectivity and can start successfully. 

About this task 

Configuring for HTTP and HTTPS console access involves editing theweb.xmlfile of Web components. Use this procedure to identify and edit the appropriate Web XML files. 

Important: These steps are provided for information purposes only, as setting up the environment for HTTP access is not supported. 

Procedure 

1. Change to the following directory:JazzSM_WAS_Profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications. 

2. From this location, locate theweb.xmlfiles in the following directories: 

 * For the Integrated Solutions Console web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 
 * For the Charts web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChartPortlet.war/WEB-INF 
 * For the Dashboard Application Services Hub Change Password web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChangePasswd.war/WEB-INF


3. Open one of the web.xmlfiles using a text editor. 4. Find the<transport-guarantee>element. The initial value of all<transport-guarantee>elements isCONFIDENTIAL, meaning that secure access is always required. 

5. Change the setting toNONEto enable both HTTP and HTTPS requests. The element now reads:<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>. 

6. Save the file, and then repeat these steps for the otherweb.xmldeployment files. 

7. Stop and restart the server. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.2.1/com.ibm.psc.doc/admin/psc_ctr_admin_restart_jazzsm_servers.html] 

Example 

The following example is a section of theweb.xmlfile forTIPChangePasswdwhere the transport-guarantee parameter is set toNONE:
<security-constraint>
<display-name>
ChangePasswdControllerServletConstraint</display-name>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>ChangePasswdControllerServlet</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</web-resource-collection>
<auth-constraint>
<description>Roles</description>
<role-name>administrator</role-name>
<role-name>operator</role-name>
<role-name>configurator</role-name>
<role-name>monitor</role-name>
<role-name>iscadmins</role-name>
</auth-constraint>
<user-data-constraint>
<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>
</user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint> 

What to do next 

Users must now specify a different port, depending on the mode of access. The default port numbers are as follows:
http://<host_name>:16310/ibm/console
Use the HTTP port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub on the HTTP port .
https://<host_name>:16311/ibm/console
Use the HTTPS secure port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub. 

Note:If you want to use single sign-on (SSO) then you must use the fully qualified domain name of the Dashboard Application Services Hub host.
