Title: IBM Sample Sametime LDAPServer document for a Domino LDAP Directory - United States

Text:
Domino LDAP directory; sametime TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
This document includes information necessary to configure the Sametime® LDAPServer document to use a Domino LDAP Directory

ANSWER
Below is a sample LDAPServer document that can be used to get a Sametime server to communicate with a Domino LDAP Server. The actual configuration in each LDAP environment will vary; however, this document is meant as a guide to assist you in configuring your document. 

The following is an example of an LDIF taken from an Domino LDAP server. 

LDIFs from the LDAP Directory
If you need assistance retrieving an LDIF from the your directory, see Technote #1240886 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=203&uid=swg21240886].


LDIF for a person in the Directory
CN=Test User,O=Domino
cn=Test User
mail=TestUser@austin.ibm.com
objectclass=dominoPerson
objectclass=inetOrgPerson
objectclass=organizationalPerson
objectclass=person
objectclass=top
dominocertificate=03002E02 7732EC99 08G01617 G002430D
givenname=Test
sn=User
uid=TUser
maildomain=Domino
sametimeserver=CN=Sametime,O=IBM


LDIF for a Group in the Directory
CN=STGroup
cn=STGroup
mail=STGroup@austin.ibm.com
objectclass=dominoGroup
objectclass=groupOfNames
objectclass=top
member=CN=Test User,O=Domino
member=CN=Test User1,O=Domino
member=CN=Test User2,O=Domino


LDAPServer document from the Sametime Configuration database (stconfig.nsf):
Based on the above LDIF examples, you should configure the LDAPServer document in the stconfig.nsf file as follows.
The following configuration uses a non-SSL connection from the Sametime server to the LDAP server with an authenticated bind.

LDAP Server Settings:

Connection Settings
Organization Name: 
Network Address of LDAP Connection: (DNS Name or IP address of LDAP Server)
Port number for LDAP Connection: 389
Login Name for LDAP Connection: cn=BindUser,o=Domino
Password for LDAP Connection: DominoBindPassword
SSL Enabled: false
SSL Port: 636
Search Order: 1

Search Filters
Search filter for resolving person names:(&(objectclass=organizationalPerson)(|(cn=%s*)(sn=%s*)))
Search filter to use when resolving a user name to a distinguished name: (&(objectclass=organizationalPerson)(|(cn=%s)(displayname=%s)(sn=%s)))
Search filter for resolving group names: (&(objectclass=groupOfNames)(cn=%s*)) 

Search Base and Scope
Base Objects
Base object when searching for person entries: (intentionally left blank)
Base object when searching for group entries: (intentionally left blank)

Scope
Scope for searching for a person: recursive
Scope for searching for groups: recursive

Schema Settings

People
The attribute of the person entry that defines the internal ID of a Sametime user: 
The attribute of the person entry that defines the person's name: cn
Attribute used to distinguish between two similar person names: 
Attribute of the person entry that defines the person's e-mail address: mail 
The person object class used to determine if an entry is a person: organizationalPerson


Groups
Attribute used to distinguish between two similar group names: 
The attribute of the group entry that defines the group’s name: cn 
Attribute in the group object class that has the names of the group members: member
The group object class used to determine if an entry is a group: groupOfNames

Home Server
Name of the Home Server Attribute: StLdapCustomizedAttributes.dominoHomeServer *SeeNoteBelow

*NOTE: The use of the "Name of the Home Server Attribute" field with Domino LDAP configuration is different from other configurations since all commas must be converted to slashes for Sametime to process the LDAP information.
