 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808] 

DESCRIPTION:The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack". [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808] 

CVSS Base Score: 5

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications 2.2 

IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications 3.0 

IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications 4.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications 2.2.0.2 HE12301 Apply JRE update JRE-6.0.16.3.IV70681+IV71888, which is available from Fix Central.

Note: ICCSAP V2.2.0 has reached end of support, and is no longer available for download. For IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 and V4.0, follow the guidance in the Workarounds and Mitigations section below.

You should verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

In particular, consult the system documentation of your SAP software on how to disable the RC4 cipher there. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The simplest way to remediate this vulnerability is to configure for FIPS140-2, Suite B or SP800-131 standards because they do not use RC4 stream ciphers. For details about how to activate this configuration, see the topic "Configuring Content Collector for SAP for US government security standards" in IBM Knowledge Center: 

 * For Content Collector for SAP V3.0: http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_3.0.0/com.ibm.iccsap.doc/doc/s_government.dita [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_3.0.0/com.ibm.iccsap.doc/doc/s_government.dita] 
 * For Content Collector for SAP V4.0: http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_4.0.0/doc/s_government.dita [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_4.0.0/doc/s_government.dita]


Alternatively, you can selectively disable the RC4 cipher for Java 7, which is used by IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 and V4.0:  * Edit the java.security file in <ICCSAP_HOME>/java/jre/lib/security and turn off RC4 by adding
   jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3,RC4 


For IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V4.0:  * If you use the bundled version of WebSphere Application Server, follow the guidance in Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503]
   
 * If you use the bundled version of IBM® DB2® LUW, follow the guidance in Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM® DB2® LUW (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21717865].
   


You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above.
