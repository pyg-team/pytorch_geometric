PROBLEM
Web Application Bridge (WAB) activity does not affect and is not affected by WebSphere Portal's inactive session timeout if the session identifier cookie has the HTTPOnly attribute set.

SYMPTOM
You may observe this problem from either of two perspectives: 

A. You are working in WAB exclusively for some period of time longer than WebSphere Portal's inactive session timeout. Upon requesting some WebSphere Portal resource you see "Your portal session has timed out because of no activity. Please start a new session at your portal Home." 

 

B. You access a page which contains WAB and do nothing more for some period of time longer than WebSphere Portal's inactive session timeout. Upon requesting a resource within WAB you expect WebSphere Portal to time out your session. Your session remains active instead.


CAUSE
The HTTPOnly attribute on the session identifier cookie (JSESSIONID, by default) prevents WAB's javascript from accessing it. This prevents WAB from synchronizing its session activity with WebSphere Portal's.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Capture HTTP headers to determine whether the HTTPOnly attribute is set on the JSESSIONID cookie. Alternatively, check the value of com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.HTTPOnlyCookies in the server's configuration.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure WebSphere Application Server (WAS) such that HTTPOnly is not set on JSESSIONID. WAS's com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.HTTPOnlyCookies controls this. Refer to the link below for documentation on this configuration setting.
