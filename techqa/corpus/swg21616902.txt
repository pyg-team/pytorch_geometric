PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you are using Google Chrome or Apple iPad Safari browsers to run web-based IBM Business Process Manager tools (for example, Process Portal or Process Center), and if you are using the Simplified Chinese (GB18030) character set, you might have issues with corrupted or missing input text and windows. 

SYMPTOM
Because Google Chrome and Apple iPad Safari browsers do not fully support the Simplified Chinese character set, the following problems can occur: 

 * The Process Center Add Link window, which is used to link external information to a process application, is unavailable or does not display correctly. 
 * The Text Area control in a Coach displays corrupted input text. 
 * The Process Center fields, for example the Process App Name field, display corrupted input text.


CAUSE
The Google Chrome and Apple iPad Safari web browsers do not fully support the Simplified Chinese GB18030 character set. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use a browser that supports the character set. For example, you can use Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer.
