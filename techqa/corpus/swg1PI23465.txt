APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running transaction server 5.1 using the Liberty
   JVM server with CICS Bundles.  Once in a while, after a
   cold start of the region, these bundles get installed
   in a disabled state and you receive the following message:
   .
   DFHSJ1101  An attempt to enable the xxx bundle with
              symbolic name <name.app>, version 1.0.0 in
              JVM server <jvmserver> has failed with
              reason code EXCEPTION_FROM_JVMSERVER.
   .
   This is caused by a timing issue involving CICS
   transactions CJSR and CRLR during startup, which is
   why it is an intermittent problem.

   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bundles with Liberty bundle parts can   *
   *                      become disabled if the JVMSERVER is     *
   *                      slow to startup.                        *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During CICS startup a JVMSERVER and CICS BUNDLE with Liberty
   bundle parts is installed.  The JVMSERVER startup is slower
   than normal and this leads to CICS attempting to enable the
   CICS BUNDLE before the JVMSERVER is enabled.  The enabling
   of the BUNDLE fails and it becomes disabled, error message
   DFHSJ1101 is output to the log.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSJBD has been updated so that as for CICS BUNDLES with OSGI
   bundle parts, if the JVMSERVER is still enabling the BUNDLES
   are queued for later processing when the JVMSERVER has finished
   enabling.
