APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer reported the following error:
   I have a COBOL batch application.  The applications use the
   asynchronous message consumer . Sometime the MQ API "SUSPEND
   gets rc 2219, sometimes the application hangs.
   .
   The change team found that there is a problem with the
   Asynchronous Consumer, where the main and consumer threads hang
   or the main receives unexpected MQRC_CALL_IN_PROGRESS (2219)
   after executing MQCTL to suspend or resume the consumer thread.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Applications using MQ asynchronous      *
   *                      consume hang waiting indefinitely or    *
   *                      fail with unexpected reason code        *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Applications using MQ asynchronous consume can experience a loss
   of the synchronization between the main and the callback threads
   causing one of the following conditions:
   
   1- MQCTL calls fail with reason code MQRC_CALL_IN_PROGRESS
   (2219).
   2- Application hangs with the main and callback threads in
   permanent wait.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Asynchronous consume support modules have been fixed to use
   addtional serialization and to do more detailed checks of state
   flags after the wait macros that control the interactions
   between the main and callback threads.
