Title: IBM Login to TDWC succeeds, but there are no menu items displayed - United States

Text:
TDWC; portfolio; blank; missing; menu; empty; view; NoSuchUserException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 No Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) portfolio menu items display in Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) although login to TDWC succeeds. 

SYMPTOM
For any user that can login to TDWC, the following set of menu items in the "portfolio" are displayed: 

 * Welcome 
 * My Startup Pages 
 * Settings -> Credential Store 
 * Settings -> Change Password


Under the "View" drop down list, the following selections are visible: 

 *  All tasks 
 *  My tasks 
 *  Tivoli Dynamic Workload Broker 
 *  Tivoli Workload Scheduler


If "Tivoli Dynamic Workload Broker" or "Tivoli Workload Scheduler" is selected in the "View:" drop down list, then there will be no menu items found in the portfolio section. 

After logging into TDWC and attempting to access TDWB or TWS views the following message can be found in TDWC's WebSphere log SystemOut.log: 


ElementRender W com.ibm.isclite.runtime.aggregation.tags.ElementRenderTag doStartTag()
user does not have permissions for view mode

Also, the following entry is found in one of WebSphere's ffdc logs:

FFDC Exception:javax.portlet.PortletException SourceId:com.ibm.ws.portletcontainer.invoker.impl. 
PortletServlet.dispatch ProbeId:255 Reporter:com.ibm.ws.portletcontainer.invoker.impl.PortletServlet@2f652f65 
javax.portlet.PortletException: com.ibm.isc.portlet.service.credentialstore.NoSuchUserException


CAUSE
The global security setting "Enable Application Security" must be selected for TWS or TDWB portfolio elements to load.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Access the WebSphere Administration Console to confirm that "Enable Application Security" is enabled with a check in the applicable box.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. From WebSphere Admin Console as the primary admin user: 


a. Go to: Security -> Global Security

b. In the Global Security panel locate the section titled "Application Security", make sure that there is a check in the box next to "Enable application security". 

c. Restart WebSphere if the box was unchecked.

- or -

2. As root (on UNIX) or administrative user on Window, change this setting within the security.xml file:

Location: <TWAHome>/eWAS/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/security.xml

a. Create a backup copy of security.xml

b. Change the second line to have: appEnabled="true" and save the file.

c. Restart WebSphere if the value was changed to true from false.
