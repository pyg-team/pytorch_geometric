 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running IBM Cognos Business Intelligence server on Oracle Weblogic application server, there may be intermittent errors like RSV-DST-0012 and CM-REQ-4265 when running reports AND/OR errors like BMT-MDC-0001 when testing Query Subjects or publishing packages in IBM Cognos Framework Manager.


SYMPTOM
When running reports, the errors can be : 

RSV-DST-0012 An error occurred while saving the output for the burst instance 'Camping Equipment' with the recipients (). The details are: CM-REQ-4265 The multipart request is invalid. An unexpected end of MIME part was encountered while reading a MIME attachment. No end MIME boundary was found;. The total size read was {totalSize}.

or

RSV-DST-0012 An error occurred while saving the output for the burst instance 'Camping Equipment' with the recipients (). The details are: Read time out after 30000 millis 


When testing a Query Subject in Framework Manager, a red X will be returned after about 30 seconds. 


When publishing a package in Framework Manager, the error will be : BMT-MDC-0001 Unable to publish 

This will still end up publishing the package to IBM Cognos Connection but it will be incomplete and unusable.


CAUSE
This is caused by a defect in Oracle Weblogic application server where they will eventually return this error : Read time out after 30000 millis

Oracle Weblogic application server version 12
