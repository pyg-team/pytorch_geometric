APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Intermittently when using the moveContent() call, (moving a
   document from IS to CE), the following error occurs:
   
   Caused by: java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find
   resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key
   IS_SSI_8824
   
   This is intermittent and could happen to any documents.  Once
   the error occurs, using FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) to view
   the document will product
   the same error.  However, after one or two retries FEM is able
   to display the document fine.
   
   The custom application would flag the document that failed to
   move then process them again the next day.  The document would
   get get moved successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Process the document again.
