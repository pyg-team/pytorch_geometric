Title: IBM SECJ0129E error when running configure-common-component-resources task - United States

Text:
theme deployment; SECJ0129E; authorization failed; response code 403 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When attempting to install Page Builder Theme, client received an authentication error during the configEngine step configure-common-component-resources

SYMPTOM
Task fails in configTrace log with:

BUILD FAILED
/usr/WebSphere7/PortalServer/theme/wp.mashup.cc.
theme/config/includes/wp.mashup.cc.theme_cfg.xml:34: The following

code 403. Exception : Forbidden . Please check the server log for details.

The Systemout.log indicates: SECJ0129E: Authorization failed for user
<admin id>:<ldap hostname>:<ldap port> while invoking GET on default_host:
jcr/remotetask, Authorization failed, Not granted any of the required
roles: AllAuthenticatedUsers


CAUSE
It appears that the security role mapping for the application JavaContentRepository was set or modified incorrectly at some point.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Reviewing a working system, we were able to compare the security role mapping to the problem system and found that Special Subjects for the AllAuthenticatedUser was missing. The working system had defined "All Authenticated in Application's Realm"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The client added this to the AllAuthenticatedUsers' Special Subjects attribute and re-ran the configure-common-component-resources task successfully
