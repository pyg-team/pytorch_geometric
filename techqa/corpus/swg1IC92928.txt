ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware 4.0.2.8
   
   When a Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy) is configured to enforce a
   WS-Security Policy (WS-Policy) and the WS-Proxy is configured
   with a Non-XML response type, the WS-Proxy may still try to
   parse the response message received from the backend. This will
   result in a parser error. This issue may be observed when using
   the 'TransportBinding' assertion in the WS-Policy.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If this issue is encountered while using the WS-Policy
   'TransportBinding' assertion, as a possible workaround, the
   'TransportBinding' assertion can be removed from the WS-Policy
   and ensure an HTTPS Frontside handler (FsH) is used with Local
   Endpoint Handler. The SSL Proxy Profile used by the HTTPS FsH
   should be configured per the 'TransportBinding' assertion.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The user was observing a parse error when a Web Service Proxy is
   configured to enforce a WS-Security Policy and is also
   configured for a Non-XML response type. Specifically, this issue
   may be observed when a 'TransportBinding' assertion was being
   used in the WS-Security Policy. This behavior was caused by an
   error in the Non-XML response processing.
   
   Fix will be available in a future major release.
