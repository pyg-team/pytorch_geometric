Viewer java support ICN navigator view download desktop TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you force ICN to download documents instead of opening them in Daeja Viewer? 

CAUSE
When using the Chrome browser, ICN downloads documents if the viewer is set as DaejaView One. It would be nice to get this same behaviour across all browsers.

ANSWER
Since update 45 of the Chrome Browser no longer supports Java. See article: https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml [https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml]
To bypass this, set DaejaView One Virtual as your viewer.

To force all browsers download documents instead of opening them via the built-in viewer do the following:

1) Open ICN admin console
2) Viewer Maps
3) New Viewer map
4) Select the necessary Content Manager you wish to utilise with this new viewer map
5) In the Viewer drop-down menu, select Web Browser as the viewer
