APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The credential check attempts to log into Portal using the
   wsadmin tool and it fails, where the PortalAdminId differs from
   the WasUserid.  To fix this issue the credential check will now
   just verify that the wsadmin tool can authenticate with a
   running server.  The wcmdetect and delete tasks have been
   modified to ensure they always use the PortalAdminId and
   password.
