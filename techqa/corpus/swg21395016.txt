QUESTION
 How to setup IBM Infosphere CDC 6.3 for Oracle RAC with failover support? 

ANSWER
PRE-REQS: 

1) We must have physical access to online redologs and archive redologs from all nodes available to the node where CDC is running.
2) CDC product while running on one Node might have to access redologs from other node hence their availability on local Node where CDC is running is important.
3) How does CDC identify log path? We query Oracle global views to get information so we must make sure that all the logs are available on the path indicated by DB.



BASIC CONFIGURATION:

1) Install CDC on Node 2.
2) Install CDC on Node 1. 
(Node 1 will override metadata in db which was created by Node 2).
3 You need to make sure that <CDC INSTALL LOCATION>/instance folder must be mounted as shared mount on both nodes now. This will enable both nodes to access <CDC INSTALL LOCATION>/instance/ folder which is infact shared content from Node 1. This will enable our product to even work when Node 1 is down and we want to start working from Node 2. Steps above will also enable Node 2 to have all subscription and instance config available to it because it will be sharing CDC instance information from Node 1. 

4) Create first instance on Node 1.
Physical location for instances is as follows:
<CDC INSTALL LOCATION>/instance/<INSTANCE NAME>
5) Create subscriptions and run the product.
6) Incase of Node 1 fails over to second node. 
a)Cleanup remaining processes on Node 1.
b)Ensure that all redologs (Online and Archive) from all nodes are available to system where CDC engine is now going to be launched.
c)Launch CDC instance on Node 2.
d)Verify via trace files if instance has started without any issues.
<CDC INSTALL LOCATION>/instance/<INSTANCE NAME>/log
e)Verify via access manager that agent points to correct node and all subs have correct agent info.
f)Start subscription.
