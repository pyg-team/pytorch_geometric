PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The client acceptor dsmcad schedule invocation may fail showing some messages which report a return code 24. That Unix return code means "Too many open files ". 

SYMPTOM
Schedules are not executed and the client dsmerror.log shows errors like: 

ANS1977E Dsmcad schedule invocation was unsuccessful. This command will be tried again in 10 minutes.
ANS0361I DIAG: ccCreateTimerFile: Unable to create timer file '/tmp/file7RYo5o', errno=24, error:Too many open files
ANS1977E Dsmcad schedule invocation was unsuccessful. This command will be tried again in 10 minutes.
ANS9959W IBM Spectrum Protect acceptor received a non-critical network error 24, IBM Spectrum Protect return code : -50.
TCP/IP received rc 24 trying to accept connection from server.
ANS0361I DIAG: ccCreateTimerFile: Unable to create timer file '/tmp/file7RYo5o', errno=24, error:Too many open files
ANS1977E Dsmcad schedule invocation was unsuccessful. This command will be tried again in 10 minutes.


CAUSE
The Unix "nofiles" ulimit is too low.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Spectrum Protect client using client acceptor scheduler on all supported Linux platforms.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if the client error log shows the above messages with the return code 24.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the "nofiles" ulimit for the dsmcad process. 

"ulimit -a" allows you to check the current value. 

To temporarily change the values to "unlimited", run the following Unix ulimit command from the same shell that starts the dsmcad process: 

 "ulimit -n xxxxx" 

where xxxxx is the new value. It can be set to unlimited with: 

"ulimit -n unlimited". 

The whole system ulimit may be updated by changing the /etc/security/limits.conf file; contact the system administrator to do so. 

If the client system uses Linux systemd to start daemons, the following option may be added to the "dsmcad.service" startup file: 

"LimitNOFILE=infinity"
