ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "ParaMarkerAfterRepeat=FALSE" in Soda.ini
   
   I verified the problem that "ParaMarkerAfterRepeat=FALSE" does
   not work
   for embeded repeat. It only works for a single repeat. I will
   log this
   as a defet.
   
   Problem Description:
   What I'm trying to do is display the first level of a use case
   the recurse through the steps and display the business rules
   that are traced from the child requirements without displaying
   each of the child requirements. ?I seem to be getting a repeat
   and a paragraph marker for each of the child requirements. I
   have set "ParaMarkerAfterRepeat=FALSE" in Soda.ini and I do not
   have any extra paragraph markers in my template.
   I have discussed this with Debra Johnson Advisory Software
   Engineer, ProjectConsole/SoDA who thinks this may be a defect.
   My template is detailed below.
   
   OPEN Project, a ReqPro Project
   REPEAT UseCase, a URRequirement, using Project.URRequirements,
   where
   <Self>.BankApplicability LIKE "YB" AND <Self>.TagNumber =
   <PROMPT> AND
   <Self>.HierarchicalLevel = "0"
   DISPLAY UseCase.FullTag
   DISPLAY UseCase.Name
   DISPLAY UseCase.Text
   DISPLAY UseCase.BankApplicability
   REPEAT UCChild recursively, a URRequirement, using
   UseCase.ChildReqts,
   where <Self>.BankApplicability LIKE "YB"
   REPEAT BRLLink, a Relationship, using UCChild.TracesTo, where
   <Self>.
   RelatedReq.TagPrefix = "BR"
   DISPLAY BRLLink.RelatedReq.FullTag
   DISPLAY BRLLink.RelatedReq.Name
   DISPLAY BRLLink.RelatedReq.Text
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  I have been trying to find a workaround for this issue and after
   lengthy
   research, a workaround that I could offer at the moment is to
   add some
   text, for example xxx, after child requirements repeat in a SoDA
   template.
   
   [OPEN1]
   [MASTER2] [REPEAT3] [DISPLAY4] <UCRequirement.FullTag>
   [ENDDISP5]
   [DISPLAY6] <UCRequirement.Name>[ENDDISP7]
   [MASTER8] [REPEAT9] xxx [MASTER10] [REPEAT11] [DISPLAY12]
   <Relationship.RelatedReq.FullTag> [ENDDISP13] [DISPLAY14]
   <Relationship.RelatedReq.Name>[ENDDISP15] [ENDREP16] [ENDMAST17]
   [ENDREP18] [ENDMAST19] [ENDREP20] [ENDMAST21]
   
   Edit -> Replace, please type xxx^p then replace all. (^p in Word
   represents a carriage return).
   
   Then Edit -> Replace and type xxx to get rid of all other xxx.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SoDA WILL NOT introduces new line for NULL or NON NULL elements
   within "NON RECURSIVE REPEAT" by itself. But, currently, SoDA is
   introducing a new line at the end of each ITERATION RESULT of
   RECURSIVE REPEAT. This behavior of SoDA causes empty new lines,
   when an ITERATION RESULT is NULL. So itÂ¨s obvious, that more the
   null ITERATION RESULTs the more empty lines in the report.
   
   Very important to note here, that the ITERATION RESULT is not a
   single REPEAT or a single DISPLAY output.  It could be, one or
   more DISPLAY elements  with/without LIMIT, one or more REPEAT
   element with/without LIMIT, or combination of  DISPLAY &  REPEAT
   elements with/without LIMIT. So it make more sense to have SoDA
   not to introduce new lines by itself while processing RECURSIVE
   REPEAT too.
   
   This fix will do that. This fix boils down to very simple rule
   that what you have in the template is what you get in the
   report.
   
   Extra white spaces still occur since the objects' attributes are
   empty. To workaround this, remove all the paramarkers between
   repeat and endrepeat annotation of the recursive repeat and set
   ParaMarkerAfterRepeat to FALSE in the soda.ini file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 2003.06.13
