APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Prereq checking support for WBI prereqing WAS was just added.
   Here is the
   failure scenario.  WPS 6.011 FP prereqs the WAS 6.027 FP.  If
   I try and
   install the WPS 6.011 FP without first installing the WAS
   6.027 FP I get
   the expected prereq failure screens.  Now, if I press the BACK
   button and
   now choose to install the WAS 6.027 FP it seems to install
   fine.  I now
   relaunch the UPDI and try to install WPS 6.011 FP and it once
   again fails
   the prereq check.  If instead of hitting back I quit and
   restart the UPDI
   and install the WAS 6.027 FP first and then relaunch and
   install the WPS
   6.011 FP everything works fine.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Othe IBM products who are using the          *
   *                 UpdateInstaller version 6.0.2.x to install   *
   *                 fixpacks for their products, and the fixpack *
   *                 requires a specific level of WebSphere       *
   *                 Application Server to be installed.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During the installation of fixpacks     *
   *                      for WebSphere's stack product, the      *
   *                      prereq checking might fail even though  *
   *                      the correct prereq level has been       *
   *                      installed.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During the installation of fixpacks for WebSphere's stack
   product, such as WebSphere Business Integration, the fixpack
   instructed the UpdateInstaller to do a prereq check to see if
   a specific level of Application Server is installed. Once this
   prereq check is done, the version information is cached. If
   the user clicks the BACK button on the UpdateInstaller,
   installs the required level of Application Sever and then
   clicks NEXT, the prereq checking is still failing.
   
   The version information is cached once the prereq checking is
   done. When the UpdateInstaller retrieves the Application
   Server version information again, the cached value is always
   returned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added a new method in the wasproduct component so that the
   UpdateInstaller prereq checking code can call this new method
   to clean up the cache before getting the version information
   again.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.0.2.9.
