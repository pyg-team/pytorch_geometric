Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in OpenSSL( CVE-2016-0800 ) affect IBM WebSphere MQ on OpenVMS Alpha & Itanium when using HP OpenSSL V1.4 kit - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 1, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by HP SSL 1.4 on HP OpenVMS. IBM WebSphere MQ on OpenVMS Alpha & Itanium uses HP SSL and has addressed the applicable CVE ( CVE-2016-0800 ) the “DROWN: Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption" vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-0800 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0800]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. By using a server that supports SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to decrypt TLS sessions between clients and non-vulnerable servers. This vulnerability is also known as the DROWN attack.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111139 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111139] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The vulnerability affects versions 6.0 of IBM WebSphere MQ on OpenVMS Alpha & Itanium.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Fix IBM WebSphere MQ on OpenVMS Alpha & Itanium. 6.0.2.12 , 
6.0.2.13 IT14528 Download the fix from Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%2FWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+MQ&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=IT14528&source=fc] 

On HP OpenVMS, IBM recommends upgrading to WMQ version 6.0.2.12 / 6.0.2.13 and applying the fix and also update HP OpenSSL V1.4 kit to latest HP OpenSSL V1.4 kit supplied by HPE ( Supported environment for MQ V6.0 on OpenVMS can be found here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013058] ). After applying the fix, server blocks the use of SSLv2 protocol and “SSLv2 client hello” messages for SSL handshake. 

IBM recommends that the same certificate should ONLY be shared with identical server configuration and software. 
If the same certificate were shared with different server(s) configuration or software, IBM recommends replacing the different server(s) with unique certificates to protect against the DROWN exposure. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
