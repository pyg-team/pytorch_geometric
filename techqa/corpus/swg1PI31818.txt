   This abend occurs when startup processing is trying to migrate
   the CHLAUTH records on SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE and there is a
   record from V710 which is shorter than the V8 migrate code is
   epxecting. In the reported case the record in question was
   a result of
   SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS() USERSRC(NOACCESS)
   command

   ****************************************************************
   A CHLAUTH definition has been created at V710 which has a small
   object length (70 bytes).
   The Qmgr started at V800 and records are read from the dataset
   SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE.
   The function rsiValidateChlPrf calls rsiValidateObject for the
   CHLAUTH record with a minimum object length of 72 which is the
   size of a Chlauth Profile structure at V710. This length also
   includes some padding to the nearest double word boundary.
   Because this length is larger than the length of the actual
   record the abend occurs.
   The Qmgr subsequently abends with CSQV086E REASON=00D96001.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CMQXRSCF function rsiValidateChlPrf has been changed to call
   rsiValidateObject with the correct minimum length.
