Title: IBM Support of VIOS Premium agent for Flex System Manager - United States

Text:
VIOS Premium agent Flex System Manager FSM ITM Tivoli Monitoring system p support certified TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does the VIOS Premium agent support the Flex System Manager? 

CAUSE
The VIOS User's Guide only describes a procedure to configure the agent in HMC environments. It does not mention Flex System Manager (FSM) because the document was written before FSM was available. It already documents the user@hostname syntax, which is also valid for FSM environments, but this is not mentioned explicitly.

ANSWER
The VIOS agent is certified with Flex System Manager. No changes were required, so no interim fix is required to add support.

A revised User's Guide has been published, and it has a note to use FSMuser@FSMhostname in the configuration:
