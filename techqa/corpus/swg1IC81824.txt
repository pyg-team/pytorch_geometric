ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DataPower write operations over the NFS protocol might not
   report internal write failures when performed against an
   unreliable remote NFS server.
   
   DataPower write operations can be compromised if the NFS server
   crashes, goes down, experiences slow performance or reboots
   while these write operations are in progress.
   
   Under these conditions, the RPC re-transmission sequence will
   end after a timeout, because the NFS Volumes in DataPower are
   soft-mounted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Insure that your NFS server and the network connectivity to the
   NFS server are stable.   For situations, where several DataPower
   appliances are using the same unreliable NFS server, you may
   wish to investigate a High Availability NFS server solution.
   
   Until this is fixed, write operations on NFS Volumes (read-only
   volumes are not affected) should be avoided if the NFS Server is
   unreliable. The following alternatives can be chosen for the
   different uses of NFS in the appliance:
   
   - Logging targets: choose a different log target type for
   logging messages; for example, you may log the messages to the
   files in the hard-disk of the appliance and select a best fit
   archiving option, either rotation or upload using FTP (all
   appliance types)
   
   - B2B Gateway Archive Target: It is recommended to use FTP or
   SFTP  to upload the archive files to a remote data store. You
   can also select any other supported protocols; such as,  FTP,
   FTP over SSL, SFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, MQ, MQFTE or RAID.
   
   - NFS Destinations: for destinations used in any of the
   gateways, via Routing URL or stylesheet extensions, such as
   url-open(), you can select any other supported protocol
   available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This will be fixed in the next major release.
