Related Information 
 * Ensure that the latest levels of service are applied to each IBM product listed in the Software Compatibility Product Reports. In some cases, a specific version of a product might be required to take advantage of new function in CICS TS V5.1. 
 * The system requirements also apply to the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Developer Trial V5.1 that is intended as a try-before-you-buy version of the full CICS TS V5.1 product. CICS TS Developer Trial V5.1 is free of charge and for evaluation (non-production) use only, offering a full set of features but with restricted performance and limited operational lifespan.
