ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Variables which depend on the values of Tag variables fail with
   'reference to undefined variable' due to a problem with the expa
   nsion order.
   
   steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a Tag variable
   2. Create an Env group, and variable
   3. Set variable from #2 to the value of the variable in #1
   
   tag variables appear to be expanded in the same block as the pro
   ject variables, but at the end
