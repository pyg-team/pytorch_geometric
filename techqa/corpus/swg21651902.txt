Title: IBM How to uninstall Guardium S-TAP manually if the uninstaller gets problems - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We'd like to uninstall Guardium S-TAP which was installed via GIM, but there is an issue with our network and therefore we can't do it via GIM. In this situation, how do we uninstall Guardium S-TAP directly on the DB server? 

SYMPTOM
There is a problem between the S-TAP on DB server and the Guardium appliance, such that we can't un-install the S-TAP from the Guardium GUI console using GIM.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following is based on an AIX Server - used as an example . 

Please attempt the following steps to clean up Guardium modules from the DB server. 


1. Attempt an un-install of S-TAP via GIM. See the following manual page for details. 


 * 
 * <your_guardium>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 



2 Uninstall GIM client 

 * 
 * root
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  <installation_directory> /modules/GIM/current/uninstall.pl 
   
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * <your_guardium>
    * 
    * 
   
   
   [ NOTE] <installation_directory> is something like this:  * /usr/local/guardium/
   
   



3 (Optional) This is a workaround to be taken only if the S-TAP uninstaller in step 1 didn't work. 
 * 
 * 
 *  <installation_directory> /modules/KTAP/current/guard_ktap_loader stop 
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  /etc/drivers/guard_ktap_loader start 
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * <some_number>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <installation_directory>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


4. Reboot the system - This action will unload K-TAP completely and reload /etc/inittab 
 * 
 * 
 *  genkex | grep tap 
   
   
 * 
 * install_assist
 * 




5. Reset Client from Guardium GUI
