ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - RHEL 5.8
       - Product: RSA 8.0.4.1
   
   Reproducible: Y
   
   Description of problem:
   
   When you save a diagram as PNG under RHEL 5.8, the resulting png
   misses parts of the text and/or notes. Exports to PDF, JPG or
   SVG are fine. The problem also happens on RHEL 5.9, though the
   missing text is not exactly the same. The problem does not
   happen on RHEL 6 nor on Windows.
   
   Steps to reproduce
   
   1) Create a class diagram that contains several classes and
   interfaces with various relationships and where cardinality of
   the relationship is displayed
   2) Export this model as PNG using the 'file-?save as image file'
   context menu and open the PNG file with any editor.
   3) Notice that some of the text of the diagram related to
   cardinlity of relationship is not written in the PNG file
   
   Workaround
   
   You need to save the diagram as SVG or PDF and then use an
   external tool to convert the generated image into a PNG file.

   The image generation API in Eclipse GMF had a problem, which
   caused text to be omitted for PNG images, on certain
   environments.

   decision is t oclose this as No plan to fix.
