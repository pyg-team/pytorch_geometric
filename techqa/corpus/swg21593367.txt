ABSTRACT
 Collecting troubleshooting data for Virtual Portal issues with IBM WebSphere Portal expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. 

CONTENT
If you have already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21672901] 

Virtual Portal Problem Information
Virtual Portal issues include: cannot create, modify or delete a virtual portal, XMLAccess export, import, or update, access control problems, user or group search, administration portlets in virtual portals, virtual portal login, and so on.

Data Collection

Use the following instructions for collecting the necessary troubleshooting data.

I. Enabling trace logging 

Enable tracing during problem recreation in order to investigate the specific behavior of the component(s). Choose to enable either static or dynamic tracing and proceed with the steps accordingly. For further information regarding logging and tracing in the portal, refer to the System event logging [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/trouble/adsyslog.dita] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/trouble/pd_intr_logs.html] topic in the WebSphere Portal Knowledge Center. 

Option A: Enabling static (extended) tracing
Static tracing is the recommended method of capturing data, as it collects data from server startup until problem recreation. 

1. Log into the Integrated Solutions Console as the WebSphere Application Server administrator. 

2. Click Troubleshooting->Logs and Trace->WebSphere_Portal->Diagnostic Trace. 

3. On the Configuration tab, ensure Enable Log is selected. On this same tab, ensure you increase the Maximum File Size and and Maximum Number of Historical Files as needed to ensure that the tracing of the problem recreation is not overwritten due to the amount of traffic on the system and output of the tracing itself. 

4. Click Change Log Level Details and enter the following trace string: 

 * Use the following trace strings at a minimum:  * com.ibm.wps.engine.Servlet=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.vpmapping.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.command.vp.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.portlets.managevirtualportals.*=all
   
   

 * If the problem is related to login or user and group management in a virtual portal, add  * com.ibm.wps.engine.commands.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.authentication.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.puma.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.puma.*=all:com.ibm.wps.um.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all
    * 
   
   
 * If the problem is related to permissions or access control, add:  * com.ibm.wps.ac.impl.AccessControlConfigFederator=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.ac.impl.AccessControlFederator=all
   
   

 * If the problem is related to XML access or Release Builder, add:  * com.ibm.wps.command.xml.*=all
   
   


5. Click OK and save the changes. 
6. Restart the WebSphere_Portal application server. 



Option B: Enabling dynamic tracing 
Dynamic tracing can be used for situations that do not permit a server restart. 1. Log in as the Portal administrator. 

2. Click Administration->Portal Analysis->Enable Tracing. The Enable Tracing portlet appears. 

3. Type the required trace string into the field Append these trace settings: 

 * Use the following trace strings at a minimum:  * com.ibm.wps.engine.Servlet=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.vpmapping.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.command.vp.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.portlets.managevirtualportals.*=all
   
   

 * If the problem is related to login or user and group management in a virtual portal, add  * com.ibm.wps.engine.commands.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.authentication.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.services.puma.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.puma.*=all:com.ibm.wps.um.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all
   
   

 * If the problem is related to permissions or access control, add:  * com.ibm.wps.ac.impl.AccessControlConfigFederator=all:
    * 
    * com.ibm.wps.ac.impl.AccessControlFederator=all
   
   

 * If the problem is related to XML access or Release Builder, add:  * com.ibm.wps.command.xml.*=all
   
   



4. Click the Add icon. Enable Tracing updates the field Current trace settings. 

Note: Restarting WebSphere Portal will remove traces that were set by using the Enable Tracing Administration portlet. 


Additional Data 
1. Specify how the virtual portals were created: through the ConfigEngine task "create-virtual-portal" or through the Manage Virtual Portals portlet. 

2. Run the configuration task, " list-all-virtual-portals", to show currently configured virtual portals. The output will be logged to ConfigTrace.log file. 

3. Obtain an XMLAccess export [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21260098] of the virtual portal. 

4. Take a screenshot of the Manage Virtual Portals portlet. 


II. Collecting and submitting logs and configuration data 

1. Reproduce the problem. Collect screenshots, userId, and timestamp information as appropriate. 

2. Run the following script from <wp_profile>/PortalServer/bin to collect the data: 

 * Windows: wpcollector.bat 
 * Linux/Unix/i: wpcollector.sh


Note: If you wish to use wpcollector to FTP the files to IBM Support, include the -Dpmr=<pmr_number> parameter to indicate the relevant PMR #. For example: wpcollector.bat -Dpmr=11111,222,333 


3. If you did not FTP your files via wpcollector, locate the "wp.mustgather.zip" file or the "<pmr #>-wp.mustgather-timestamp.zip" file in <wp_profile_root> [https://idoc2.swg.usma.ibm.com/portal/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v70/reference/wpsdirstr.html#wpsdirstr__wp_profile_root]/filesForAutoPD/. Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571].  

4. Upload the XMLAccess export of the virtual portal and screenshot of the Manage Virtual Portals portlet. Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]. 

 

Note: When sending in logs for review, include any relevant screenshots, timestamps, userIds, etc. in order to expedite analysis of the issue.
