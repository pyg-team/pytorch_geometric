 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM b-type SAN switches and directors addressing Open Source OpenSSL Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-2177, CVE-2016-2178). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Relevant CVE Information: 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
