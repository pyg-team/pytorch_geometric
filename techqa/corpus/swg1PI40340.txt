APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Portal holds the list of virtual portals (VPs) in a Java map.
   If a new VP is created on the node which performs this task,
   the map gets correctly updated.
   However, other nodes do not get informed of this new VP.
   Therefore, if an other node returns the list of VPs for the
   Admin Portlet, this is not correct.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The nodes of the Portal cluster which have not a correct list
   of VPs must be restarted. Or if such a node processes
   a creation or deletion of a VP, then the list gets updated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 07 (PI40843 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI40843]) for Portal
   8.5.0.0 available from Fix Central:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We created a new cache with name
   com.ibm.wps.model.impl.VirtualPortalMap.
   When using the Cache Viewer to display the list of caches, this
   cache shows up. The configuration parameters of this cache
   should not be changed.
   As this cache is cluster-aware, adding or removing virtual
   portals is propagated to the other nodes.
