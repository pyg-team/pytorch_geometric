PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Manual Explore in IBM Security Appscan Standard, a page does not load, or a blank page loads, or the page is not displayed properly. 



SYMPTOM
The page is not displayed properly in the Manual Explore browser as it would display in a standalone Internet Explore, Firefox, Chrome browser.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There may be multiple causes of this behavior. First verify if the page currently loads in a stand alone browser such as Internet Explore, FireFox or Chrome. 

If it does then verify if the page load in that browser when connected to AppScan Standard (see How to substitute the built-in AppScan browser with an external browser [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21645651] ). 

If still having issues, check the following cases: 

 

If the page does not load at all (nothing loads, blank page or network errors) 

 *  Verify if you need any Proxy to load the page in the stand alone Internet Explore.  * If yes, set in AppScan: Scan Configuration > Communication and Proxy > Use Internet Explore proxy settings 
    * If Internet Explore is not using a proxy to access the web site then try setting AppScan to: Scan Configuration > Communication and Proxy > Don't use proxy 
    * If an automatic configuration script is being used, download it, open in a text editor, determine the static proxy address/IP and port and use this in AppScan. 
    * (In Internet Explorer check the proxy under: Tools > Internet Options > Connections > LAN Settings )
      
      
   
   It could be also due to the proxy filtering certain type of content. Navigate to the Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > General: Proxy file extension filter setting and clear its value. 
   
   Verify if any Platform Authentication is needed in Internet Explore to load the page
   Check Platform Authentication in AppScan Standard [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002279]. 
   
   The scanned site may require a specific HTTP User Agent header. 
   To identify and change the header, consult technote How to change HTTP User-Agent header [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299938] . 
   
   The scanned site may have an issue with the HTTP Accept-Encoding header AppScan is sending. 
   First try to if removing completely the Accept-Encoding header helps. Navigate to: Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Communication: Remove 'Accept-Encoding' header and set it to: False. 
   
   If the side requires a specific HTTP Accept-Encoding header, for example: "Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate", then force AppScan sending the header. Navigate to Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Communication: Custom headers and enter ";Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate" as the value of it. 


If not accessing HTTPS pages, but accessing HTTP pages  *  This may be a certificate issue due to the fact that AppScan is recording as a proxy (and "man-in-the-middle"); to prevent certificate issues, try adding AppScan certificate under Tools > Options > Recording Proxy, or in the AppScan Browser itself (there is a button to add the certificate there). 
   
   Verify which SSL is used by the application. Then select only that version in Tools -> Options.. -> Scan Options -> SSL support . 
   
   

If the page is displayed incorrectly (with script errors or some functionality on the page is broken)  *  Verify if JavaScript Execution is needed to load the page. 
   If it is, set the option Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > JavaScript: Automatic JavaScript Execution in Manual Explore to True
   
   Is any of the content or scripts on the page cases sensitive? 
   If they are check the option Scan Configuration > URLs and Servers > Treat all paths as case sensitive 


If navigating to some pages works but navigating a specific page consistently shows blank page.  * 
 * 
 * 
 * - Tools > Options > Advanced > Communication Proxy Timeout
 * 
 * 
 * - Scan Configuration > Communication and Proxy > Timeout
   
 * 
 * 
 * 2. If the content is too big and it exceeds the max response size in AppScan, adjust the options:
   - Tools > Options > Advanced > Logger LogTraffic MaxResponseLen to 209715200 
   - Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Communication: Maximum response length to 32
   and restart AppScan.


If you get certificate errors or security warnings... 

 *  Usually these can be bypassed by accepting the warning/installing the certificate. Add the site as a trusted site in Internet Explorer. If a client side certificate is needed for authentication install it in the scan configuration under HTTP Authentication. Try refreshing the window, it could be a timing issue.
   

If the target Application is compatible with specific browsers only 

 *  Proxy a browser (e.g. Internet Explore, FireFox) into AppScans Proxy port to perform the Manual Explore from that browser instead of the Manual Explore browser. The technique is outlined in technote #1287443 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21287443]. 

For troubleshooting the issue gather the following data and upload it to the support ticket:  *  Extended Support Mode logs capturing the issue in AppScan. the traffic log from a standalone browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) obtained through Fiddler, or Paros, or similar proxy tool, demonstrating how it should work.
