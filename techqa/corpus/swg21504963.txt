Title: IBM Problem on TEP workspaces after applying maintenance. - United States

ITM workspaces KXX java cache jar delete TEPS TEP Tivoli Enterprise Portal TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 ITM fails to load workspaces correctly, and displays them with labels like Kxx:KXXyyyy instead of real (meaningful) labels. 

CAUSE
The jar files containing the Java code are versioned. If the version doesn't change for a particular jar file with what is currently in the JRE cache, it assumes it is the same and will not download it from the web server. This can cause problems with mismatched code. 

ANSWER
The mismatch of the jar files can be solved by: 

a) adding the TEPS server to the bypass list via Internet Explorer -> Connection tab -> Lan Settings -> Click the "Advanced" button in the 'Proxy Server' box and add the hostname of the TEPS server in the Exceptions window

b) clear the Java cache by following these steps, depending on the type of Java:

IBM Java 1.5 on Windows

1. From the Windows start button, select "Control Panel".
2. From the control panel, double click on the Java plug-in control panel icon.
3. Press the "Delete files" button.
4. Un-check the "Downloaded applications" and "other files" check boxes.
5. Press the OK button to clear the Java applet jar cache.

Sun Java 1.6 on Windows

1. From the Windows start button, select "Control Panel".
2. From the control panel, double click on the Java plug-in control panel icon.
3. From the Java plug-in control panel general tab, select the "settings" button.
4. From the "Temporary File Settings" dialog, select the "Delete files" button.
5. From the "delete temporary files" dialog, un-check the "trace and log files" check box leaving the "applications and applets" check box checked.
6. Press the OK button to clear the Java applet jar cache.

The browser is now cleaned of the application jar files, reconnecting to the TEPS will download them properly.
