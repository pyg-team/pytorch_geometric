Text:
sap syslog alerts disable ibmmon itm_cnfg TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are you getting a SAP message ITM-Failed_get_salr_mt_get_alertdata-NO_ALERTS_FOUND in the SAP system log? 

CAUSE
In SAP Agent versions 710 FP2 IF1 and 711 FP2 there is a functionality to log the SAP Standard Function Module's exceptions and write a subsequent log entry into SAP System Logs.
ITM-Failed_get_salr_mt_get_alertdata-NO_ALERTS_FOUND will be generated when no alerts have been found in the current interval for the selected monitor set.

ANSWER
From SAP Agent Version 711 FP3 onwards, there is a configuration setting in the database table /IBMMON/ITM_CNFG to enable/disable writing such logs. You can disable these alerts in SAP Agent 711FP3 release by following below steps: 

1. Log in to SAP GUI 
2. Execute Transaction code 'SE16' 
3. Give table name '/IBMMON/ITM_CNFG' 
4. Click on 'Create Entries' (F5) 
5. Give parm_name = 'DISABLE_SYSLOG_ALERTS' AND value_char = 'YES' 
6. Click on Save
