Title: IBM FileNet Content Engine Centera failover fails - United States

Text:
centera TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM FileNet Content Engine does not fail-over to secondary Centera device when Primary Centera device fails. 

SYMPTOM
 

 * EMC Centera configured with a primary and secondary node 
 * Primary node fails 
 * Content is no longer being migrated to Centera


CAUSE
By default, the primary device will be the one to which CE will write all documents. CenteraStar will replicate the document to the other devices. If the primary device fails, then CE will no longer be able to add documents to the Centera Cluster.

ENVIRONMENT
Content Engine 5.1
Centera Fixed Content Device, 2 nodes.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
CE instances need to be restarted, allowing CenteraStar to reset the pool and identify one of the secondary devices as the new primary device.
