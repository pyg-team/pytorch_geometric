APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using a SDO API method like 'isDataType()' is not found by the
   serviceDeploy tool (e.g. used in POJO). serviceDeploy fails with
   following exception:
   
   classpathModule.jar/MyServiceImpl.java:34: cannot find
   symbol
   symbol  :  method isDataType()
   location:  interface commonj.sdo.Type
   Ressource: classpathModule.jar/MyServiceImpl.java
   Position:  34
   
   The class/method in question are part of the following JAR:
   <widWTERoot>\runtimes\bi_v7\feature_packs\sca\sdoplugins\sdo_api
   .jar
   
   The JAR is referenced correctly by WID but not the serviceDeploy
   tool
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In WID V7.0.0.2 the class/method is found correctly; export the
   PI and ensure that the Java source code file containing the
   problematic Java code is not exported (only the already
   compiler .class file). The serviceDeploy will run correctly.

   the class/method in following JAR:
   <widWTERoot>\runtimes\bi_v7\feature_packs\sca\sdoplugins\sdo_api
   .jar can't be found by the sca module when using
   serviceDeploy to generate the ear application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  From WPSV7.0 the class/method in following JAR:
   <widWTERoot>\runtimes\bi_v7\feature_packs\sca\sdoplugins\sdo_api
   .jar can't be found by the sca module when using
   serviceDeploy to generate the ear application.
