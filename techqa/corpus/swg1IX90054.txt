LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Marshalling/Unmarshalling of wchar was not supported when
   included in complex user defined data types like  structures,
   exceptions or sequences that cause the CORBA Marshal Error
   message to be thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR9
   .
   Marshalling/Unmarshalling of wchar is supported now by adding
   definitions for wchar types.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20100630 or later
