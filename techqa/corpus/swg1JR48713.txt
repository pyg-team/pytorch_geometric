   *                      Business Space cannot handle the widget *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Cognos Report Viewer widgets are not displayed correctly after
   you
   import Business Space from WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.4
   to
   IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that removes the URL format prefix from the
   href attribute. After the URL format prefix is removed, the href
   attribute looks like the following bolded text:
   
   <A style="DISPLAY: none; VISBILITY: hidden" lang="en"
   class="mm_Item" href="#dateDimensions">
