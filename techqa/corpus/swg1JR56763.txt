APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a business process definition (BPD) or BPEL task is deleted
   from IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), a change log entry is
   created in the PFS_BPD_CHANGELOG or PFS_BPEL_CHANGE_LOG table so
    that Process Federation Server is notified of this deletion and
    can remove the corresponding document from its Elasticsearch
   index. When this deletion is completed in the Elasticsearch
   index, the corresponding row is not removed from the
   PFS_BPD_CHANGELOG table.
