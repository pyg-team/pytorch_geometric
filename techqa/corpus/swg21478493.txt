Title: IBM Interrupting Clementine stream execution occasionally takes a long time to respond - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Occasionally when I try to interrupt the execution of a Clementine stream, the stream execution continues for a significant amount of time before the execution actually stops. Why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you interrupt a stream execution in Clementine we rely on each operation (including database access implemented by 3rd party ODBC drivers) to respond in a timely manner. In some rare cases, perhaps due to a resource problem, the operation may not respond to the interrupt within a timeframe you would expect.

In Clementine 11 the ability to interrupt a stream twice has been added. Interrupting the stream a second time in the event of the first interrupt not responding will abruptly terminate the Clementine Server (or local back end if running in local mode) session.

Note that if the hang is occuring outside of stream execution (eg. during an ODBC call for example) then this option for a second interrupt will not abruptly terminate the server process
