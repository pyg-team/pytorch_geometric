PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We are unable to find new reports that are saved and we do not see changes made in existing reports that were resaved. 

SYMPTOM
After making changes to existing report studio reports and selecting the save option the changes are not saved when you reopen the report in Report Studio and confirm.
After creating and saving a new report the report does not exist in the saved location.
No error messages are encountered when saving an existing or a new report.


ENVIRONMENT

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clear the IE browser cache: 
- Launch IE and navigate to Tools > Internet Options 


- General tab
- Under the Browsing history selection ensure the option 'Delete browsing history on exit' is checked.
- Select the Delete button option and ensure that 'Preserve Favorites website data' is unchecked and all other options are checked.
- Select Delete
- Re-launch the browser, uncheck the 'Delete browsing history on exit' option. 


Ensure the webpage retrieves the most recent page from the server:

- In Internet Explorer open Tools>Internet Options
- General tab
- Browsing History section Settings
- Ensure you have the 'Every time I visit the webpage' radio button selected. 

In a distributed environment ensure that all servers including gateways, content manager and application server installs have the same fixpack installed.
