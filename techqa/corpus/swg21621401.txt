 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A solution cannot be exported from Case Manager administration client, with the following error: "FNRPA0187E The page <name> does not exist in the solution." 

SYMPTOM
When you try to export a solution via Case Manager administration client, you receive the following error: 


FINER Thu Dec 06 16:38:21 EST 2012 THROW
com.ibm.casemgmt.api.exception.ACMException thrown while executing method performFinish() of com.ibm.ecm.configmgr.app.acm.wizards.ExportSolutionPackageWizard$1
Stack Trace follows (when available):
com.ibm.casemgmt.api.exception.ACMException: FNRPA0187E The page <name of page> does not exist in the solution.
at com.ibm.casemgmt.api.exception.ACMException.createException(ACMException.java:71)
at com.ibm.casemgmt.api.Page.fetchPage(Page.java:116)
....

INFO Thu Dec 06 16:38:21 EST 2012 The solution package for the solution or template could not be created. Use your case management installation and configuration checklist to verify the Content Engine server property values that you entered in the wizard and ensure that the Content Engine server is running. 






CAUSE
During an export operation, Case Manager administration client cross checks all of the artifacts that are defined in Business Space with the artifacts that are in the Object Store for the solution. If the artifacts in the Design Object Store do no match what is defined in the Business Space database, you will receive the error. 


This error condition can be caused by one of the following actions:

1) Creating a step page in Case Manager Client, registering the page with IBM Case Manager, and then deleting the page without un-registering. This scenario leaves an artifact in the design object store, while the page is deleted in Business Space.

2) Trying to clean up the design object store manually, by deleting the step page from the design object store. This can leave the Business Space artifact in the Business Space database.


In Case Manager Client, in the solution space, you can create additional Step pages or duplicate existing Step pages. Based on the instructions provided in the information center, when you create a page you must register the page by assigning a Page Type and saving the page via the 'Case Manager Page Settings'.

If you skip the step to register the page, or if you unregister a page but do not delete the page from the Solution Space, you will not be able to export the solution by using the Case Manager administration client. During the export, Case Manager administration client will return the above error. 

 

If the page that has been deleted was previously renamed, the error logged in the Case Manager administration client log file will contain the original step page name. The original name of the step page will be stored in the connection definition file which is associated with the solution. The resolution section below will discuss how to reconcile the information in Content Engine and Business Space. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to correct the problem, the mismatch of the Step Page artifacts between the Design Object Store and the Business Space database must be corrected. 

 

To determine the Step Page artifact that is associated with a solution defined in Business Space, do the following steps: 

1) Log in to Case Manager Client, and click on the 'Manage Spaces' link at the top of the page. When the 'Space Manager' loads, select the '<solution name> Step Pages' link to see what pages are created in Business space. 

2) Access the Business Space space collection xml file. 

This can be retrieved by accessing the following URL:
http://<ICM host>:<port>/mum/mycontenthandler?uri=space:collection

Once this page loads, right click on the page, and select 'View Source'.
The pages that are created and registered will look like the following in the src:
{"logicName":"TestPage","physicalId":"M092734CD89070D25B342AFDBE06713000000"}

Where TestPage is the name of the page that is defined, and the M092734CD89070D25B342AFDBE06713000000 is the identifier in Business Space for that page.


To determine the Step Page artifact that is associated with a solution stored in the Design Object Store, do the following steps: 

1) Navigate to the Design Object Store > IBM Case Manager > Solutions > [solution name] > Pages. When you register a page, an Object Store artifact is created for the page. This is the location where the page is stored. 

2) Navigate to the Design Object Store > IBM Case Manager > Connection Definitions. Select the connection definition that is associated with the solution that you are trying to export. The connection definition file is a text file, which you can open. When you register a page, IBM Case Manager adds the page name, along with the Business Space identifier in this file.

Once you have found the appropriate artifacts in Business Space and in the Design Object Store, you need to validate whether the associated artifact exists in Business Space and vice versa. It is important that you do not perform unnecessary clean up of artifacts that are not related to the error. After you reconcile the inconsistencies, you will be able to export the solution. 

To properly delete a page from your solution, make sure you follow this TechNote:
