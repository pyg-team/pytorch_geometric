ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ----- Problem Description -----
   When starting RiskWatch customer is getting two messages:
   1) a non-exisitng configuration file 'cumLinInterp.cfg' --
   probably a
   leftover after removing some features in Algo One 5.1
   2) RunningAverageExcludeToday is not a configuration variable
   anymore
   -- Customer didn't find any information in release notes about
   removing this
   configuration variable. Please explain what happened to this
   variable? Was it replaced by the EveningResetsPostDetermined
   variable?
   
   Explicitly RunningAverageExcludeToday setting was the resolution
   of an issue in 5.0, so why remove it?
