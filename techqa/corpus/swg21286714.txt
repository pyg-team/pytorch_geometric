PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you configure the Data Collector, if you change the IP address of the machine where the Data Collector is located, the Data Collector will not be able to connect to the Managing Server. 

CAUSE
The Data Collector configuration retains the previous IP address in some of the runtime files. After you change the IP address, the Data Collector still references the previous IP address.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the runtime version of the datacollector.properties file.
Perform the following procedure: 

1. To test basic connectivity, on the Managing Server machine, for the new Data Collector IP address, issue the following command: 

ping <ip_address> 

2. On the Data Collector machine, in the <DC_home>/runtime
/<appserver_version>.<node_name>.<server_name>
/<appserver_version>.<node_name>.<server_name>
.datacollector.properties file, set the following properties to the new IP address of the Data Collector: 

 * am.socket.bindip 
 * am.socket.exportip


For example: am.socket.bindip=9.12.20.220 

am.socket.exportip=9.12.20.220
