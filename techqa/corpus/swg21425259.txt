Title: IBM How to use Recurrent Timeouts from Reaction in State in Rational Rhapsody - United States

QUESTION
 How do you get recurrent timeouts from Reaction in State in IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

ANSWER
When a time-out is added within Reaction in State, the code handles it for 1 time execution only. 

Any action code for Reaction in State is generated within notify transition start and terminate. 

In contrast when a time-out is added to a state as a transition then schedule Transition is called. 

Also, rootstate_substate and rootstate_active is reset to itself. 

The code appears as: 

NOTIFY_TRANSITION_STARTED("1");
if(rootState_timeout != NULL)
{
rootState_timeout->cancel();
rootState_timeout = NULL;
}
NOTIFY_STATE_EXITED("ROOT.state_0");
NOTIFY_STATE_ENTERED("ROOT.state_1");
rootState_subState = state_1;
rootState_active = state_1;
rootState_timeout = scheduleTimeout(100, "ROOT.state_1");
NOTIFY_TRANSITION_TERMINATED("1");

Therefore its better to show recurrent timeout as transition than as Reaction in State.
