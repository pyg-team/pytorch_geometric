APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The automatic login feature for the web tools appears not to
   work or doesn't work as described in the manual, anyway. (IBM
   Tivoli Network Manager Topology Visualization Guide Version 3.7
   (NMIP_Visualization.pdf), page 180, section title "Configuring
   Telnet Login Details")
   while it picks up the default values initially, it loses
   the values by the time it tries to connect to the router
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Anyone who wants to use autologin when webtools connect to the
   device via SSH
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The original description of this problem was wrong. Automatic
   login _does_ work as described in the manual if the user
   connects via telnet. The only time it doesn't work is when
   connecting via SSH, which was a feature I added in response to
   APAR IZ62710 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ62710].
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   | fix pack | 3.7.0-ITNMIP-FP0010
   | fix pack | 3.8.0-ITNMIP-FP0003
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  I have changed the relevant script (ncp_webtool.cgi) so that it
   works properly when the user selects "Automatic login" and
   "Use SSH" on the webtools form. This change will be in the
   next fixpack for ITNM 3.7 (fixpack 10).
