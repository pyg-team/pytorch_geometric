APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Nowhere in any of the documentation does it explicitly show that
   port 15001 is also required for communication between the
   Summarization and Pruning Agent (S&P) and the TEPS.  In a few
   places in the 6.1 and 6.2 Installation and Setup Guides it shows
   that port 15001 is used by the TEPS, however it doesn't even
   state that the use of this port is for CORBA requests.
   Regardless, since the S&P's configuration GUI requires customers
   to place port 1920 (for the TEPS' embedded Web Server) as the
   destination port for the TEPS, it follows that a reasonable
   customer would assume that the S&P only talks to the TEPS over
   port 1920.  In fact, after testing S&P --> TEPS connections on
   both 6.1 and 6.2, port 15001 is used as well.  Thus, any
   customers requiring specific firewall ports be opened will never
   open 15001 between their S&P and the TEPS, and thus can spend
   many man hours trying to determine why the communication isn't
   successful.
   
   The obvious places to add this information are:
   
   ITM 6.1 Installation and Setup Guide
   1) Chapter 10 -- Additional Tivoli Enterprise Portal
   configuration
   2) Appendix C -- Firewalls
   3) End of Chapters 13, 14 and 15 -- TDW solution using DB2,
   MSSQL and Oracle, respectively
   4) Chapter 16 (Tivoli Data Warehouse colutions: common
   procedures), within the first section, "Configuring the
   Summarization and Pruning agent (JDBC connection)", step 9 on
   page 179 needs to have 1920 listed as the default port as well
   as a note speaking to 15001 as also required in the case of the
   firewall separating the S&P agent and the TEPS.
   
   
   ITM 6.2 Installation and Setup Guide
   All the same places as mentioned above for the 6.1 guide, except
   one additional place:  Chapter 12 in the new 6.2 guide has a
   section entitled "Firewall considerations for the Tivoli Data
   Warehouse".  A note should be placed in the appropriate place in
   this section which clarifies the need for 15001 for S&P --> TEPS
   communication.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  the obvious -- open 15001 for TCP comms in firewall separating
   S&P and TEPS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Nowhere in any of the documentation does it explicitly show
   that port 15001 is also required for communication between the
   Summarization and Pruning Agent (S&P) and the TEPS.  In a few
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Information was added to the 6.2 Installaion and Setup Guide
   explaining the use of port 15001. Multiple chapters were updated
   to include the information about port 15001.
   
   The documentation should be available with the release of 6.2
   Fix Pack 1.
