 glibc is used by Power Hardware Management Console (HMC). HMC has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-9761 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9761]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nan function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-8776 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8776]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service. By passing out-of-range time values to the strftime function, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault or obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-8777 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8777]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc or libc6) could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in elf/rtld.c. By using a zero value of the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass access restrictions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109775 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109775] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-8778 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8778]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bound memory access and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6

CVEID: CVE-2015-8779 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8779]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the catopen function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
