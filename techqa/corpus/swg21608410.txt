QUESTION
 Is Information Server supported on Citrix environment? 

ANSWER
IBM will support customers who use Server-side application virtualization of Citrix XenApp (formerly Citrix Presentation Server) to run Information Server client applications. You should still raise PMRs through IBM Support in the normal way and IBM support will do everything possible to address problems raised in this environment, but if all options/workarounds are exhausted, then we may ask you to run the Information Server clients directly, without using Citrix, in order reproduce and resolve a problem. Please note that other methods of using Citrix XenApp, such as Client-side application virtualization, are not supported. 

Also, it is important to follow the Information Server System Requirements document when sizing the Citrix server which will be hosting the Information Server client applications, bearing in mind the number of concurrent users that need to be supported.
