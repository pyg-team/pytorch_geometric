PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
Why are the modules I restore and try to archive on my unix server's new DOORS database failing? After I restore a module and try to open it, I get an error saying: "Unable to open module '/module/name' No such file or directory $SERVERDATA/.../...*.dtc ", and when I try to archive anything I get an error saying: "No Such File or directory $SERVERDATA/xxxxxxxx.zip" 

SYMPTOM
After restoring a module, opening it results in an error saying: "Unable to open module '/module/name' No such file or directory $SERVERDATA/.../...*.dtc ", 

When archiving anything an error is displayed indicating: "No Such File or directory $SERVERDATA/xxxxxxxx.zip"



CAUSE
If permissions are set properly on $DOORSHOME and $SERVERDATA as the install manual documents, the issue will be because there are missing files in the Rational DOORS database server installation which are needed by the archive/restore process. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the $DOORSHOME/etc for the following two files: 

 * zip 
 * unzip


The problem arises when these two files are missing. The solution is to reinstall the Rational DOORS database server and verify that these files are created.
