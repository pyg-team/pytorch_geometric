APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Oracle as the database, in the (Cognos-based) Report Viewer
   widget, if a dimension is based on a metric of type String, and
   at least one instance of the monitoring context has a value that
   is sufficiently long (i. e. a dimension value is sufficiently
   long), drilldown on that dimension will fail, with an Oracle
   error being reported.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: With Oracle as the database, in the     *
   *                      (Cognos-based) Report Viewer widget,    *
   *                      if a dimension is based on a metric     *
   *                      of type String, and at least one        *
   *                      instance of the monitoring context      *
   *                      has a value that is sufficiently long   *
   *                      (i. e. a dimension value is             *
   *                      sufficiently long), drilldown on that   *
   *                      dimension will fail, with an Oracle     *
   *                      error being reported.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A Cognos query (in IBM Business Monitor) used to extract values
   for a String metric on drilldown was assuming a maximum string
   length of 32 characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Cognos query was modified to assume a maximum string
   length of 1024 characters.
