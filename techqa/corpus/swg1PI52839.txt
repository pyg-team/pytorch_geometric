COMMENTS
 *  Problem summary:
   
   The Java component of MQ on z/OS included several jar files
   which are not required when using the MQ classes for Java and
   MQ classes for JMS on z/OS.
   
   These jar files can cause problems for applications if their
   contents conflicts with classes used by the application.
   
   Problem resolution:
   
   The build process for the Java component of MQ has been
   modified to remove the unwanted jar files.
   
   This fix changes the Java component of MQ, and will be
   included in a FixPack APAR.
   
   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:
