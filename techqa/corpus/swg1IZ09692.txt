ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ESR: Omegamon XE for Messaging v. 6.0.1
   All TEMS and TEPS are Windows 2003
   Agents are Solaris and AIX
   After Deploying the MQ agents to Managed Systems from the CLI
   using
   tacmd addSystem, the Managed System Name of the MQ agents is
   simply the
   hostname.  No ::MQ is appended to the end.
   The full command line used to deploy the agent is as follows:
   tacmd addSystem -t MQ -n stnavapp01:KUX -p _UNIX_STARTUP_.
   Username=candle INSTANCE=MQSTNAVAPP01
   Once the agent is installed it reports to the TEMS as follows:
   tacmd listsystems -t MQ
   ...
   stnavapp01                  MQ           06.01.00.XX Y
   ...
   If the MQ agent is deployed manually via the TEP, the Managed
   System
   Name is correct.
   i.e.:
   BD1ST03::MQ                 MQ           06.01.00.XX N
   I see that the AGENT.NAME parameter can be passed to the
   addSystem
   command, however according to the documentation, this will only
   affect
   the middle quantifier of the name and will not append the ::MQ
   to the
   end.
   .
   Severity explanation
   Deployment of product is halted completely
   .
   Recent changes to the system
   .
   Corrective actions already taken
   .
   Values in input variables when problem occurred
   Command used to preform install:
   tacmd addSystem -t MQ -n stnavapp01:KUX -p _UNIX_STARTUP_.
   Username=candle INSTANCE=MQSTNAVAPP01
   Where MQSTNAVAPP01 = the QueueMgr Name, and stnavapp01::KUX is
   the OS
   agent of the system
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  I am going to try a few more options that I found in the output
   of
   ?tacmd describeSystemType ?t MQ?, however when I put these
   parameters in
   to the addSystem command, I receive a timeout error.  I have set
   the
   TACMD_TIMEOUT variable larger, but I am still receiving the
   error.
   Which timeout value should I increase to get past this problem?
   
   Regards,
   Jay

   KUICAR010I: The agent type mq is being deployed.
   
   KUICAR020E: The addSystem command did not complete because a
   deployment
   error occurred. Refer to the following error returned from
    the server:
   
   The monitoring server encountered an error while deploying the
   managed
   system.
   
   The kuiras1.log file may provide more information about this
   error. If
   you require further assistance resolving the error, contact
    IBM Software Support.
   
   A timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete
   on
   chadvappoms02.
   
   The agent task did not complete within the configured time out
   period.
   
   Verify that the target system is online. Increase the time out
   value and
   try the operation again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In ITM's user guide, there is an appendix which explains how to
   use tacmd addSystem and tacmd addBundles with examples. We will
   also provide a detailed description for these commands and some
   good examples in fix pack 1 installation guide, just like ITM
   did.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This documentation fix will be available in fix pack 1
   installation guide.
