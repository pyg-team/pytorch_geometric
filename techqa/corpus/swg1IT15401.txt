APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In 10.0.0.4, you cannot deploy a message flow containing a
   custom connector.
   
   The deploy fails with a NullPointerException message:
   BIP3701E: A Java exception was thrown whilst calling the Java
   JNI  method ''AdminAgentThread_getDeployMessage''. The Java
   exception was ''java.lang.NullPointerException''. The Java
   stack trace was ''Frame : 0 java.lang.NullPointerException:
   null''
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V10.0.0.4 using custom Java
   connectors.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A regression introduced in IBM Integration Bus V10.0.0.4 means
   that message flow nodes using custom Java connectors cannot be
   deployed to integration servers. Custom Java connectors includes
   all connectors not shipped with the product, including IBM
   developed connectors on GitHub and user developed connectors.
   When a message flow node that uses a custom Java connector is
   deployed, the deployment is rejected with a
   NullPointerException:
   
   BIP3701E: A Java exception was thrown whilst calling the Java
   JNI  method ''AdminAgentThread_getDeployMessage''. The Java
   exception was ''java.lang.NullPointerException''. The Java stack
   trace was ''Frame : 0 java.lang.NullPointerException: null''
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The connector framework has been fixed so that message flow
   nodes using custom Java connectors can be deployed.
