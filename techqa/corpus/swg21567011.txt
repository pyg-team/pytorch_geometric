QUESTION
 How do you run an RPT script multiple times in less than 1 minute in IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Transactions? 

CAUSE
The scheduling facility in ITCAM for Transactions allows RPT scripts to run at a minute time span of granularity.

ANSWER
Use profiles to run RPT scripts and schedules without having to wait for one minute interval. If a script runs on average in 17 seconds, placing the RPT script in an RPT schedule multiple times shows the script running more than one time in the span of a minute. 

In this example there are 3 instances of the "googled" script added to User Group 1 in the "howfastcanyougoogle" RPT schedule.

After exporting the RPT schedule to the ITCAM Console, create a profile to run the RPT schedule.

To see the result of this one run of the RPT schedule, drill down on a specific transaction, starting from Robotic Response Time -> Transactions, until the SubTransactions are displayed. Here you see the "googled" script ran 3 times in this one iteration of the RPT schedule.
