PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM InfoSphere Information Server: In Oracle Enterprise Edition operator, jobs using special characters for the username or password properties fail. Special characters include any characters other than alphanumeric or underscore characters. 

SYMPTOM
The following error message is displayed: 

Incorrect dboption list; it failed on expected "," or "}", got: "#" line 1


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the values specified for the Username and Password properties conform to the following requirements:


 * Values that contain special characters must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Each special character must be escaped with a back slash character. For example, if the Oracle user is defined in the database as user#1 with the password 1a\b, you specify the following values:
   Username: "user\#1"
   Password: "1a\\b" 
 * Values cannot contain single or double quotation marks. 
 * Values that begin with a numeric character must be enclosed in double quotation marks. For example:
   "1password"


These requirements also apply when the DB Options Mode property is set to User-defined, and you need to specify the DB Options property manually. For example, if the Oracle user is defined in the database as user$1 with the password 1test, you specify the following value for the DB Options property: 
{user="user\$1",password="1test"}
