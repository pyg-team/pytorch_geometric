(Note: In this technote, default directories are used. If you are using a non-Linux platform (like AIX, or HP-UX or Solaris) simply replace the 'opt' in the path with 'usr' or if you are using non-default directories, then collect the logs using the non-default directories.) 

* Collecting the WAS TEMA logs and config info: The new WAS TEMA logs are now in the /opt/IBM/ITM/logs dir. Use the ITCAM-provided kyncollect.sh script to collect the WAS TEMA logs and the config info. The output log file created is in the /opt/IBM/ITM/tmp/kyn dir. Send this output file to your friendly IBM support engineer for analysis.
