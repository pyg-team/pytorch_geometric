APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have attempted to install Statistics 22.0 client for Linux
   (64-bit) on Scientific Linux (https://www.scientificlinux.org/)
   or another Redhat derivative.
   You have elected to license the product as "Authorized User",
   but you are given no chance during the installation to supply an
   authorization code.  When you try to launch the License
   Authorization Wizard or license directly with
   'licenseactivator', these fail with various errors referencing
   the echoid command and seeming 32-bit dependencies.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Scientific Linux is an untested and unsupported variant of RHEL.
   The 64-bit distribution is seemingly 64-bit pure, having no
   32-bit libraries installed by default.  Our current 'echoid'
   executable references 32-bit libraries that are included on our
   supported platform, RHEL 5.x and 6.x 64-bit.  Please see
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/i
   ndex.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html]  for the compatibility reports and supported operating
   systems for this product.
   
   In the above instance, the issue was resolved by installing the
   32-bit glibc: sudo yum install glibc.i686
   
   A similar issue has been encounterd on Debian and Ubuntu. The
   simple workaround there will be to install the ia32-libs
   package.
   From command line:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
   
   For Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS:
   sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
   
   This behavior will be addressed in a future release of IBM SPSS
   Statistics
