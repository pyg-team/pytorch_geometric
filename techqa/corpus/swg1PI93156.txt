APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Your CICS Configuration Manager server processes a DELETE API
   request that will delete that last resource in a CICS Group.
   The request results in CICS message DFHCA4881 as illustrated
   below:
   
   DFHCA4881 I <date/time> <region> CCVA GROUP <group> DELETED.
   
   Program CCVSMCSD abends with the message:
   
   DFHAP0001 <region> AN ABEND (CODE 0C4/AKEA) HAS OCCURRED AT
   OFFSET X'00003C20' IN MODULE CCVSMCSD.
   
   Program CCVSMCSD scans the DFHCA4881 message for the text
   string ' Group '. However, the CICS message was upper-cased
   (refer SIT parameter MSGCASE=UPPER), and the scan was not
   matched until memory was exhausted and the abend S0C4 occurred.
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): KIXREVWJB 0C4 ABEND0C4
   ABENDS0C4
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Modify the CICS TS SIT MSGCASE parameter to specify MIXED.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CCVSMCSD Abend S0C4 (AKEA) at offset    *

   CICS Configuration Manager processes a DELETE API request that
   will delete that last resource in a CICS Group.  The request
   results in CICS message DFHCA4881 as illustrated below:
   
      DFHCA4881 I <date/time> <region> CCVA GROUP <group> DELETED.
   
   Program CCVSMCSD abends with the message:
   
      DFHAP0001 <region> AN ABEND (CODE 0C4/AKEA) HAS OCCURRED AT
                AT OFFSET X'00003C20' IN MODULE CCVSMCSD.
   
   Program CCVSMCSD scans the DFHCA4881 message for the text
   string ' Group '. However, the CICS message was upper-cased
   (refer SIT parameter MSGCASE=UPPER), and the scan was not
   matched before memory was exhausted and the abend S0C4 occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS Configuration Manager is corrected.
   The correction includes:
      1.  Scanning to match both mixed and upper case messages
      2.  Limiting the scan search range
