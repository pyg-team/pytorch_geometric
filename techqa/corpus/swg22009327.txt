Title: IBM Warning Message in Upgrade Health Check result - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Health Check Patch throws' WARNING: We have detected discrepancy in adapters in static 

configuration files and adapters connected to the system currently.' 

CAUSE
This warning indicates that during the upgrade process we store the existing 
primary adapter interface IP and then apply it to the system after it reaches v10. 

It has been observed that if the system had the adapters remapped to do things such as use a 
10G expansion card or to work around broken Ethernet adapters then the interface that 
is detected as primary ends may not be the expected primary adapter. 
If console access is confirmed then this can be resolved after the upgrade concludes 
and connectivity can resume. This warning should not stop an upgrade plan, it should 
alert to the potential issue that depending on organization may be difficult to resolve 
without prior authorization.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After checking and ensuring 'store network interface map' returned proper output, found that file /etc/eth_macs was empty. 

Generally this /etc/eth_macs file should have a combination of interface against the mac address for that interface. 

NOTE: Content entered into this file is case sensitive. 


To resolve the issue, manually populate this file and re-install the health check patch.
