SUMMARY
 Portions of IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software are shipped as a component of Rational Developer for i (RPG and COBOL + Modernization Tools, Java and EGL editions), and Rational Developer for AIX and Linux. 
OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 28, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software. IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0701 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0701]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, caused by the use of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters based on unsafe primes that are generated and stored in X9.42-style parameter files. By performing multiple handshakes using the same private DH exponent, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3197 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3197]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, caused by an error related to the negotiation of disabled SSLv2 ciphers by malicious SSL/TLS clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110235 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110235] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
