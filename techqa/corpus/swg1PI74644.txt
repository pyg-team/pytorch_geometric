APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a table with long column names, like
   IMPLEMENTATION_SELECTION_CRITERIA_DEFINED_FLAG, in my DB2
   database.
   I have defined a DSN on my Linux server, where Modeler Server is
   installed. I am using the SPSS Data Access Pack driver, the DB2
   Wire Protocol - but this occurs with all databases.
   
   If I use libspssodbc_datadirect_utf16.so instead of
   libspssodbc_datadirect.so (which is required in some cases), I
   can see the table, but if I want to preview it, I get:
   SQL table not found
   
   I can read the table from my Windows Client.
