PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * P8 Workplace XT 1.1.3.0  and App Int BCS  1.1.3,             *
   * P8 Workplace XT 1.1.4.0  and App Int BCS   1.1.4,            *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Adding an item to Favorites, folder or document, though BCS  *
   * would case the user preference file to be updated but the    *
   * class attribute was not being preserved in BCS. This caused  *
   * a problem with MyWorkplace in Workplace XT that needed this  *
   * attribute in order to work properly.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * To resolve the problem for 1.1.4 update to workplace XT fix  *
   * pack 1.1.4.5. There is no work around other than not to add  *
   * to Favorites in BCS 1.1.4 but add them using Workplace XT    *
   * 1.1.4 if you are working with MyWorkplace.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to preserve the class attribute in the User
   Preference file. This is done by making sure that the class
   attribute is serialized into and out of BCS when there is any
   change to the Favorites. This fix is in Workplace XT fix pack
   1.1.4.5. MyWorkplace will now function properly after any
   changes BCS makes to the users Favorites.
