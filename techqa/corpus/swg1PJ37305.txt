APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When republishing a document that has an associated "settable
   only on create" property, the publish action fails with the
   error:
   The Publishing handler threw an exception.  The requester has
   insufficient access rights to perform the requested operation.
   Attempt to modify settable only on create property.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create Publish Template
   - Publishing Designer > Republish Instructions tab > under
   "Republish a versionable document" select "Version the current
   publication document" or "Version and replace the current
   publication version"
   - Publishing Designer > Republish Instructions tab > under
   "Properties of the new publication" select "Use properties
   defined under 'Properties To Apply"
   - Publishing Designer > Properties To Apply tab > select "Use
   the source document properties"
   2. Create document that is to be published
   Create a subclass of the Document class and add a "settable only
   on create" custom property, and add the document as this class
   3. Publish the document using the publish template
   4. Optionally version the document and specify new property
   values (but note that this can not be done for the "settable
   only on create" custom property)
   5. Republish the (versioned) document
   
   Expected result: The publication document is successfully
   versioned and properties are changed (except for the "settable
   only on create" custom property that can not be changed).
   
   Actual results before the fix:  The publish action fails with
   the above specified error.
   
   As a sidenote, both the source document and the publication
   document can be checked out and in from Workplace.
