ABSTRACT
 This white paper provides you with information about IBM Rational ClearCase 8.0 migration strategies for VOB Schema 80 and Feature Level 7. 

CONTENT
 

ClearCase version 8.0 introduced both a VOB Schema and Feature Level update to allow for new functionality within the release. To be able to benefit from these changes, existing ClearCase 7.x and prior VOBs will require both a database reformat and then an update to the new Feature Level. While a ClearCase version 8.0 VOB server can support both Schema 54 and Schema 80 VOBs simultaneously, careful planning must be done to minimize downtime and ensure a successful migration from Schema 54 to 80 as well as the Feature Level update. 

 

This document will provide you with the steps needed to perform a successful migration of your VOBs.
