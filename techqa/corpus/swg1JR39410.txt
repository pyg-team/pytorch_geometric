PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere      *
   *                  Enterprise Bus Server using IBM's SCA EIS   *
   *                  Binding and Prefers Asynchronous            *
   *                  Qualifier.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The SCA Runtime does not distribute the *
   *                      workload of Prefers Asynchronous        *
   *                      Binding                                 *
   *                      Qualifiers on the EIS Binding.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  This problem can be circumvented by         *
   *                  deploying                                   *
   *                  the EIS Binding in a separate module (also  *
   *                  a                                           *
   *                  best practice) and invoking the target      *
   *                  component in a separate SCA module using    *
   *                  the                                         *
   *                  default SCA binding asynchronously.         *
   ****************************************************************
   The SCA Runtime does not distribute the workload of Prefers
   Asynchronous Binding Qualifiers on the EIS Binding resulting in
   workload balancing not evenly distributing workload across notes
   of a cluster.  This is caused by the asynchronous invocation
   getting optimized into a synchronous invocation.
