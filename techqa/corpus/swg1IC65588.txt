ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Here is the summary on the update high2key with NULL value
   issue:
   ---------------------------
   create table test(i int, c char(50));
   insert into test(i) values 1;
   insert into test values(2,
   '0123456789112345678921234567893122222');
   insert into test values(3,
   '0123456789112345678921234567893123333');
   insert into test values(4,
   '0123456789112345678921234567893124444');
   insert into test values(5,
   '0123456789112345678921234567893125555');
   select c from test order by c desc;
   select colcard, substr(high2key,1,40), substr(low2key,1,40) from
   syscat.columns where tabname='TEST';
   runstats on table schema.test;
   select colcard, substr(high2key,1,40), substr(low2key,1,40) from
   syscat.columns where tabname='TEST';
   When trying to update the column statistics collected by db2look
   with -m option, it fails with SQL1227N.
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLUMNS SET COLCARD=2, NUMNULLS=1, SUB_COUNT=-1,
   SUB_DELIM_LENGTH=-1, HIGH2KEY='',
   LOW2KEY='012345678911234567892123456789312', AVGCOLLEN=51 WHERE
   COLNAME = 'C' AND TABNAME = 'TEST';
   DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because
   it was not a valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL
   processing it returned:
   SQL1227N  The catalog statistic "" for column "HIGH2KEY" is out
   of range for its target column, has an invalid format, or is
   inconsistent in relation to some other statistic. Reason Code =
   "3".  SQLSTATE=23521
   The update should proceed successfully.
