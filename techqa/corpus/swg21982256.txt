RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An official patch fix is available via below technote: 


http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982420 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982420]

Or a manual work-around below is available. If you do the manual work-around and then later install the official patch fix, you would need to first reverse the manual work-around before installing the official fix.

The manual work around is:

Copy the http*.jar files
from C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\InfoSphere\lib\iis\20thirdparty
to C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\InfoSphere\classes 
-and-
<IIS Install>/ASBServer/apps/lib/iis/classes 

 Restart Websphere
