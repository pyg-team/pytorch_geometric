APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Community File-upload box contains embedded style elements
   in HTML instead of CSS which prevent us from changing dark blue
   colors to the light blue color of our company intranet. This
   upload box looks like the default LC3 one and we can't really do
   anything with it.
   
   Example of the embedded HTML styling is:
   
   
   <a role="treeitem"
   aria-controls="lconn_files_widget_FilePicker_0_content"
   href="javascript:;" style="display: block; white-space: nowrap;
   text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;
   margin: 0px
   1px; clear: both; position: relative; outline-color: rgb(0, 0,
   0);
   background-color: rgb(50, 79, 118); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
   padding-left: 15px;" title="Recent Files" tabindex="0"
   aria-selected="true"><span style="display: inline-block;
   padding-bottom: 3px; padding-top: 3px; padding-right: 5px;
   background-color: rgb(50, 79, 118);">Recent Files</span></a>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, the customer can make the manual changes:
   
   
   In the following files:
   
   <WAS_PROFILE_HOME>/installedApps/WASSPCell01/Files.ear/qkr.share
   .files.war/js/built/bundle_actions.js
   
   <WAS_PROFILE_HOME>/installedApps/WASSPCell01/Files.ear/qkr.share
   .files.war/js/built/community-widget.js
   
   
   You will find the following line of code, and just change the
   color as you wish:
   
   colors:{divider:"#EAECEE",separator:"#E5E5E5",background:"#FFFFF
   F"
   ,foreground:"#000000",menuText:"#000000",secondaryText:"#848484"
   ,selectedBackground:"#324f76",selectedMenuText:"#FFFFFF"}
