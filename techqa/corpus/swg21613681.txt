    * Based on the actual problem encountering, tracing for different subsystems may be required. Follow additional instructions from IBM Support. 
   
   
 * Reproduce the problem and collect the following logs:  * On Content Collector server:  * ContentCollector\ctms\logs\ibm.ctms.taskrouteservice*.log 
       * ContentCollector\ctms\logs\ibm.ctms.p8connector*.log
      
      
    * On the P8 Content Engine server:  * For WebSphere Application Server:
         install_root/profiles/profile_name/FileNet/server_Instance_name/p8_server_error.log and p8_server_trace.log 
       * For WebLogic Server:
         /user_projects/domains/my_domain/FileNet/AdminServer/p8_server_error.log and p8_server_trace.log 
       * For JBoss:
         jboss_install/jboss-as/bin/FileNet/server_instance_name/p8_server_error.log and p8_server_trace.log
         
      
      The exact location of the logs can be found from the Content Engine ping page.
