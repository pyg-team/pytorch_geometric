PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing the ClearQuest Web server feature of Rational ClearQuest, warning messages might appear that instruct you to perform additional configuration tasks. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This section presents the warning messages that administrators might encounter after installing the ClearQuest Web server feature of Rational ClearQuest by using the IBM Installation Manager, and describes actions that the administrator should take. 

Important: The Installation Manager might incorrectly issue warning messages even if the installation succeeds. Before taking action, determine whether the warning message is valid by pointing your browser to http://localhost/cqweb. If you are unable to reach the ClearQuest Web application, then proceed with the recommended action as described in this technote.


 * Warning message:

 * One of the following warning messages:

 *  The automatic configuration of IBM HTTP Server requires the IBM HTTP Server Plug-in for IBM WebSphere Application Server. Follow the instructions in your product documentation for manually configuring IBM HTTP Server. The automatic configuration of IBM HTTP Server failed because plugin-cfg.xml was not created. Follow the instructions in your product documentation for manually configuring IBM HTTP Server. The automatic configuration of IBM HTTP Server failed. Follow the instructions in your product documentation for manually configuring IBM HTTP Server. The automatic configuration of IBM HTTP Server failed because the following scripts contained in FixPack 13 or later were not found: "mergePlugin" or "pluginCfgMerge". Follow the instructions in your product documentation for manually configuring IBM HTTP Server.
   
   
   Administrator action:  *  Install the IBM HTTP Server web server plug-in for WebSphere Application Server
      
      1.1. Stop all IBM HTTP Server processes.
      
      On Windows:
      Click Start > Programs > IBM HTTP Server > Stop HTTP Server
      Click Start > Programs > IBM HTTP Server > Stop Admin Server
      
      On Unix and Linux: 
      ibm_http_server_install_dir/bin/apachectl stop
      
      
      1.2. Navigate to the plugin directory under the IBM HTTP Server installation package and start the installation wizard.
      
      On Windows: 
      install.exe
      
      On Unix and Linux:
      ./install.sh
      
      
      1.2.1 On the Welcome page, select the Installation Road Map check box if you want to view the guide for installing. Click Next.
      
      1.2.2 On the Software License Agreement page, review the license terms and, if these are acceptable, select I accept both the IBM and the non-IBM terms and click Next.
      
    * 1.2.3 On the Systems Prerequisites Check page, verify that your system passes the check. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.4 On the next page, select WebSphere Application Server machine (local) because WAS 7 and IHS 7 are installed on the same machine. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.5 On the Installation Directory page, specify the Plugins directory under ibm_http_server_install_dir as the product installation location. Make sure that the path for the installation location does not include parentheses characters; otherwise, the plug-in installation will fail. 
      
      For example, on Windows Server 2008 64-Bit, the default product installation location is C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\HTTP Server\Plugins. In this case, use an alternate location such as C:\IBM\HTTPServer. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.6 On the next page, type or browse to the WebSphere Application Server installation location. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.7 On the next page, select the profile into which you deployed the ClearQuest Web Server application. If you deployed the ClearQuest Web Server application to a new profile, the name of this profile is cqwebprofile. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.8 On the next page, specify ibm_http_server_install_dir/conf/httpd.conf as the Web server configuration file and accept the default value for the web server port or specify a default value. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.9 On the next page, provide a unique web server definition name or accept the default value of webserver1. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.10 On the next page, specify ibm_http_server_install_dir/Plugins/config/ web_server_definition_name/plugin-cfg.xml as the plug-in configuration file. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.11 If you deployed the ClearQuest Web Server application to a new profile, the next page shows a message about the default stand-alone application server that does not have a web server defined. It also shows information about the profile that you are about to configure. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.12 On the Installation Summary page, review the installation configuration details. Click Next. 
      
      1.2.13 After the installation finishes, verify that the results say that the installation completed successfully. Click Finish.

 *   *  Using the administrative console:
      
      3.1.1. Start the administrative console for the WebSphere profile to which Rational ClearQuest Web server was deployed.
      
      3.1.2. Go to Servers > Server Types > Web servers.
      
      3.1.3. Select the web server from the list, then click Generate Plug-in.
      
      3.1.4 Select the web server from the list again, then click Propagate Plug-in.
      
      Using the GenPluginCfg command in WebSphere Application Server (WAS): 
      
      Run the GenPluginCfg command under the bin directory of the WAS profile into which Rational ClearQuest server was deployed, specifying the value of the -propagate parameter as yes.
      
      For example:
      C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\ClearQuest\cqweb\cqwebprofile\bin>GenPlu
      ginCfg.bat -webserver.name webserver1 -propagate yes
      
      See the WAS topic on how to use the GenPluginCfg command [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.base.doc%2Finfo%2Faes%2Fae%2Frxml_genplugincfg1.html&resultof=%22genplugincfg%22].
