Title: IBM Multi-process mode for WebSphere Transformation Extender RMI Server - United States

Text:
WTX RMI Server; Multi-process mode TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Multi-process mode for WebSphere® Transformation Extender RMI Server does not work in 8.1 release versions 

CAUSE
The problems cause can be partially attributed to WebSphere Transformation Extender's RMI Server and a major part of the problem cause can be attributed to IBM JRE. 

With the 8.1 release on Windows®, the WebSphere Transformation Extender product suite is installed under the Program Files directory with a sub-folder named WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.1. Having spaces in the directory path structure causes the java command line that spawns a separate child process to fail. This issue is specific to the Windows platform. 

On the other hand, the IBM JRE fails to spawn child processes that require interaction with the parent process using Process Streams. StreamCorruptedException occurs when such interaction takes place resulting in the multi-process mode feature to fail altogether. This issue is common to ALL supported platforms.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The java command line generated by the RMI Server in Multi-process mode to spawn a separate child process for running a map should be enclosed in quotation marks to account for the installation path with spaces in it. This is quite common with the Windows Platform's default installation path. 

PMR 00010,VYH,649 addresses the issue with command line generation in the WebSphere Transformation Extender. The fix for this PMR can be obtained from WebSphere Transformation Extender Support. 

PMR 00012,VYH,649 addresses the issue with the IBM JRE with respect to the child process streams. StreamCorruptedException with child process streams during stream read operation has been addressed in the JRE 1.4.2 SR 9 Release. The fix for this issue can be obtained from the IBM Java Support Team or the WebSphere Transformation Extender Support Team. 

Both the fixes allow WebSphere Transformation Extender's RMI Server to spawn child processes in multi-process mode. Multi-process mode is usually configured for High-load and High Availability environments. Single process mode is not impacted and works as it did in prior releases. 

Additional Note: Since the 8.1 release, the WebSphere Transformation Extender product suite ships the IBM JRE. The IBM JRE 1.4.2 is installed with the product suite in the WebSphere Transformation Extender's installation folder. (< WTX 8.1 Install Directory>/java).
