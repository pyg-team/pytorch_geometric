Title: IBM Attempt to use browser client certificate to authenticate results in "The connection was interrupted." - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Authentication to the Domino server using an x.509, or browser client, certificate does not work. The Fire Fox browser displays the error "Data transfer interrupted." Internet Explorer will display the login page after a few times of trying to get the server to accept the certificate. 

SYMPTOM
You configure the Domino server for SSL and to authenticate using only client certificates, sometimes called x.509 certificates. When you try to authenticate to the Domino server using an x.509, or browser client certificate, authentication does not complete. The Fire Fox browser displays the error "Data transfer interrupted." Internet Explorer will display the login page after a few times of trying to get the server to accept the certificate. Enabling webauth_verbose_trace=1 on the Domino server does not show that the certificate was found to be used.

CAUSE
In one particular case the Domino server internet web site document was set in the security tab to search a Certificate Revocation List to determine the validity of certificates. As no CRL existed the server could not begin the search and authentication by certificate was interrupted. Resetting the CRL search to No, then saving and closing the document and restarting Domino, and resolved the issue. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Either set the CRL search to No and restart HTTP or configure the Domino HTTP server to use a Certificate Revocation List.
