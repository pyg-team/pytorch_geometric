ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Java 1.7, the put(Object) method of the
   java.util.LinkedHashMap class is no longer implemented by the
   LinkedHashMap.  It was in previous versions of Java but in Java
   1.7, it is inherited from the parent class, java.util.HashMap.
   This method is used in the Java Snippet that is generated for
   the Data Map Activity, and the generation for the Java Snippet
   failed as a result.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The work aroun is :
   
   The user can build the java snippet by hand.  This might be
   easier done in the Java code and can be reached by going to the
   Details tab of the Properties view for the Data Map Activity and
    clicking on the Java radio button.
   
   Step 1. Generate the Data Map activity as you normally would.
   The Java code to call the Data Map will be incorrect but the
   following steps will replace that code.
   Step 2. Copy the Java code from an existing Data Map Activity
   that was correctly generated in a previous version of IID.
   Paste it into the Java code for the Data Map activity created in
   step 1.  The Java code can be seen by clicking on the Java radio
   button for the Data Map activity generated by an earlier version
   of IID, but be careful to close the BPEL process without saving
   it, since clicking on this radio button marks the BPEL process
   as being changed.
   Step 3. Change the names of the Java code you pasted above.
   Update the names of the input and output variables, and update
   the name of the .xsl file that was generated in step1.
   
   If the customer does not have a Data Map activity to copy from
   (as described in step 2), this is what the generated code looks
   like:
   
   /*                      */
   /* START of code snippet */
   /*                      */
   java.util.LinkedHashMap __result__1 = new
   java.util.LinkedHashMap();
   java.lang.String __result__5 = "input1";
   java.lang.Object __result__4 = __result__1.put(__result__5,
   input1);
   java.util.LinkedHashSet __result__2 = new
   java.util.LinkedHashSet();
   java.lang.String __result__6 = "output1";
   boolean __result__7 = __result__2.add(__result__6);
   java.util.Map __result__8 = null;
   try {
    {// NewXMLMapForBPEL.xsl
     __result__8 =
   com.ibm.wbiserver.transform.util.TransformTypeHelper.transformTy
   pes(__result__1, __result__2,"NewXMLMapForBPEL.xsl");
    }
   }
   catch(java.lang.Exception ex){
    ex.printStackTrace();
   }
   java.lang.String __result__10 = "output1";
   java.lang.Object __result__11 = __result__8.get(__result__10);
   output1 = (commonj.sdo.DataObject)__result__11;
   /*                    */
   /* END of code snippet */
   /*                    */
   
   "input1" is the name of the input variable in this snippet.  It
   needs to be changed to the name of the variable that is input to
   the Data Map in the current BPEL process.
   "output1" is the name of the output variable.  It appears twice
   and they both occurrences need to be changed to the name of the
   variable that is output of the Data Map in the current BPEL
   process.
   "NewXMLMapForBPEL.xsl" is the name of the .xsl file.  It needs
   to be changed to have the name of the Data Map that was created
   in step 1, with the file type remaining "x.sl".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The visual snippet which is generated to call the Data Map is
   not constructed properly.
