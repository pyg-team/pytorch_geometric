Title: IBM OMNIbus ObjectServer (nco_objserv) process running, but can not login - United States

Text:
Failed to make a connection due to operation error; Failed to make a connection; nco_ping; automatic_backup; corrupted database TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can not log in to Netcool/OMNIbus ObjectServer using Event List (Desktop), or nco_sql command. 

CAUSE
ObjectServer database may be corrupted

ANSWER
If the Netcool/OMNIbus ObjectSserver process nco_objserv running, or the PA nco_pa_status command reports that the ObjectServer is running, but user(s) can not login using the Event List (Desktop), or using nco_sql -server <ObjServer> command then the issue may be due to corrupted object server database. 

Verify the connectivity using ping, and nco_ping <ObjServer>. Even the nco_ping <ObjServer> command may result in the following response/error:


 * 


To confirm the issue is due to the corrupted database, using the same system/setup, create a test object server using nco_dbinit command. For example, run the command nco_dbinit -server TESTNCOMS on the same system where users can not login and create a TESTNCOMS object server. 

Start the test object server, and test the object server using the following commands: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


If the above commands work as expected then the binaries, and the system is functioning normally, and the issue (not able to log in to the object server) points to the corrupted object server database. 

Make a copy the corrupted database files and restore the object server database using good backup generated via (ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP). It is always a good practice to enable the trigger automatic_backup to backup the object server database at periodic intervals as per the business/operational needs. This trigger is disabled and need to be enabled using nco_config (Administrator GUI) or otherwise.
