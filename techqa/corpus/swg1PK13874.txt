ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  My customer is experiencing this issue all of a sudden. He did
   not have this in the past. Recently, he is having this issue.
   When he tries to build his web project on RAD v6001 ifix003.
   The build gets stuck around 82-90% until he receives an Out of
   Memory error after several hours.
   
   
   I currently helped him workaround the build problem by turning
   off the Struts Builder. By turning it off, it builds in seconds.
   So the issue is isolated to the Struts builder.
   
   This issue happens on all of the customer's machines.
   
   
   It seems to indicate a problem loading the Struts builder.
   
   This hang can be recognized by it runing the WebToolsSavePartici
   pantJob task for a long time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  disable struts builder
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
