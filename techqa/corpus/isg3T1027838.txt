 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In LSF cluster system, our clients log into remote hosts via SSH passwordless authentication. 

When some users changed their home directory permission from 700 (rwx------) to 770 (rwxrwx---) , the SSH passwordless authentication failed to work , and SSH login kept requesting users password very time. 

Is this an expected behavior ? How to resolve or workaround this issue ? 



ANSWER

This is an expected behavior for SSH. It protects user keys by enforcing "rwx------" permission setting on $HOME/.ssh and ensuring only the owner has write permissions to $HOME.

By default, SSH passwordless authentication works when the permission of users $HOME are set to "rwx------", "rwxr-x---" or "rwxr-xr-x" . 

SSH passwordless authentication will fail if there are any variation of g+w or o+w exists on the $HOME directory. 

As a workaround , the administrator can override above behavior by defining StrictModes to "NO" in the sshd_config configuration file; however this is not recommended.
