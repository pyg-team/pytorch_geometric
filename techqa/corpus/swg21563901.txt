 How does the outgoing.address work in IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Windows, v4.6.0.0? Allow multiple NIC Cards. 

ANSWER


The IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Windows Server, v4.6.0.0 allows for an initparm parameter called: "outgoing.address".

This feature in v4.6.0.0 can be used by nodes that are not part of a cluster, but do have multiple NIC's. Connect:Direct administrators that want all outbound traffic to go out a specific NIC address can use outgoing.address to force this behavior. This may be needed if a nodes multiple NIC's are each attached to a separate network segment and Connect:Direct is only used on one of those segments.

The "outgoing.address" feature is implemented in the [Local Node Characteristics] section of the init-parms as "outgoing.address". Set the value to the address of one of the local NIC's. The outgoing.address feature only affects outbound sessions. It does not affect the NIC that is used to listen for inbound connections. The listen address and port are still supplied in the tcp.host.port parameter. This is a global change. 

This outgoing.address parameter has now answered the long time Question: My machine has multiple NIC cards. How do I get Connect:Direct for Windows to use a specific NIC card / IP address to establish a connection. Answer: Code "outgoing.address" in the initparms of the NIC / IP address you want to use.
