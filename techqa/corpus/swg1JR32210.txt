ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Business Service Search function does not work in Modeler and
   WID integration environment when enable security on WSRR.
   
   Version: Modeler 6.2 and WID 6.2.
   
   Client told me that "
   "When I try to use the BSS function in my 6.2.0 WDPE install it
   errors out with the message of "Incorrect Port Number or Host
   name,  connection to remote host failed, correct port number or
   host name forselected Server, or check network connection" in
   the Business Service Search dialog. I've tested my connection to
   WSRR and it worked.  Also,I clicked Search Properties... and it
   came back with the ontologies  from WSRR, but seems like the
   Search just doesn't work for some reason.
   "
   He told me he cannot use the Business Search Service (BSS) in
   Modeler 6.2.0 when have WID on with Modeler. But when standalone
   Modeler, it works.
   
   L2 done: I could recreate his problem in my local environment
   with Modeler and WID installed into same group and enabled
   security on WSRR.  Following is my steps:
   1. I installed WID 6.2 and used Installation Manager to install
   Modeler 6.2 into WID 6.2.
   2. I configured WSRR connection in Modeler perspective. And test
   connection. You can use our WSRR Server like my setting
   information in the below screen. Here is my security setting
   information and I attached 2 key store files in this email.
      Enable Security box - checked
      UserID - admin
      Password - admin
      Key store file - c:\***\DummyClientKeyFile.jks
      Key store type - JKS
      Key store password - WebAS
      Trust store file - c:\**\DummyClientTrustFile.jks
      Trust store type - JKS
      Trust store password - WebAS
   
   If you want to enable your WSRR security, you can refer to WAS
   security enablement or below link which give you an example to
   use federated repository mode to enable security on WAS 6.1:
   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0701_ile
   chko/0701_ilechko.html?S_TACT=105AGX52&S_CMP=cn-a-wes [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0701_ilechko/0701_ilechko.html?S_TACT=105AGX52&S_CMP=cn-a-wes]
   
   Two key store files are copied from WAS installation folders
   like c:\IBM\WebSphere\ProcServer\profiles\ProcSrv01\etc\.
   
   3. Right click the project tree and selected Business service
   serach.
   4. In the Select Server windows, select one WSRR connection.
   5. Then "Search properties" return ontologies from WSRR.
   6. Then click "Search", it returned many WSDL from WSRR servers.
   7. Selected some to import.
   8. Clicked "Finish", I can get same error as clients.
