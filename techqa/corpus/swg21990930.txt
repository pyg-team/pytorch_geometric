 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install IBM Security AppScan Source on Linux results in error "Graphical installers are not supported by the VM. The console mode will be used instead."


SYMPTOM
When running the installer from a shell, you may receive the following error: 

 * 
 * Launching installer...
 * 
 * Graphical installers are not supported by the VM. The console mode will be used instead...

 * Installer User Interface Mode Not Supported
 * 
 * The installer cannot run in this UI mode. To specify the 
 * interface mode
 * , use the -i command-line option, followed by the UI mode identifier. The valid UI modes identifiers are GUI, Console, and Silent.
 * 
 * =======================================================


 

Per error message above using the -i switch returns the following error: 

 * 
 * ./setup.bin -i silent
 * This is not a supported operating system.
   Please check the system requirements and try installing IBM Security AppScan Source on a supported platform.
   


CAUSE
Graphical libraries have not been installed on Linux, or X11 forwarding has not been configured correctly. The interface mode installation option is a legacy feature that is no longer supported.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use one of the following methods to resolve the problem. 

 1. Install the graphical libraries per the Linux documentation.
    Note If running on a 64 bit OS be sure to include the required 32 bit libraries: libX11.i686 libXtst.i686 gtk2.i686 glibc.i686 libgcc.i686 webkitgtk.i686
    See the Detailed System Requirements [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=1413228722216&osPlatforms=Linux]for more information. 
 2. Install an X Server on the local system. Configure the Linux host for X11 forwarding. Speak to your System Administrator or consult your Linux documentation for instructions. 
 3. Run the installer in silent mode using a response file.


Silent mode installation instructions: 

Creating a response file 


Note the response file can be generated on any Linux or Windows system that is able to run the graphical installer. 

 * Open a command shell.
   Note Run the Command Prompt as an administrator on Windows. 
 * Set the OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE=<path to response file> environment variable.
    * 
    * set OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE=c:\temp\response.txt 
    * 
    * 
      export OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/response.txt 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Start the wizard by running the installer executable from the same shell where the EV was set. 
 * Click OK on the language selection screen. The next screen will contain the following text.
   If this screen does not reference the "installation configuration files" the EV was not set correctly.  * 
   
   
 * Select Next 
 * Select Yes to configure the install as silent and select next.  * 
    * 
   
   
 * Select the required components and select next 
 * Enter the desired install directory and select next.
   Note Enter valid information for the Operating System where the tool is being run. 
 * Follow the prompts to complete the wizard. 
 * Once completed the response file will be saved to the location referenced in the EV. 
 * If needed edit the configuration file to point to the correct paths on the target OS.
   Note Do not edit any passwords. This will invalidate the configuration file.



Installing  * Copy the response file to the Linux host. 
 * Run the installer with the -f switch and the response file as the argument:  * 
    * >setup.bin -f /tmp/response.txt

    * 
   
   Note: "Launching installer" will remain on the screen until install is complete.



Additional Notes  * If the the automation server is being installed setup needs to be run as root. 
 * The ounce user account cannot be changed during install. It can be changed afterwards using the information in Technote 1968843 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968843]. 
 * The SolidDB database option is not available when installing with a response file.

 * When installing a fix pack onto a system installed silently use the following command:
   AppScanSrc_Installer.exe -i silent -D$LICENSE_ACCEPTED$="true"
