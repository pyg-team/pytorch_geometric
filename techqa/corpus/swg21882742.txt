Title: IBM The database transfer to DB2 on a Portal 8.5 environment fails during the ConfigWizard on Step 4, the Setup database step. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The ConfigTrace.log shows the following: 

Target started: action-grant-users 

... 

[sqlproc] GRANT
[sqlproc] USE OF TABLESPACE USERSPACE1
[sqlproc] TO
[sqlproc] GROUP WP_BASE_CONFIG_USERS

[sqlproc] Error during statement execution!
[sqlproc] com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlSyntaxErrorException: DB2 SQL Error:
SQLCODE=-204, SQLSTATE=42704, SQLERRMC=USERSPACE1, DRIVER=4.14.113


This means that DB2 threw the following error:.

DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-204, SQLSTATE=42704, SQLERRMC=USERSPACE1,
DRIVER=4.14.113

during the execution of this SQL command...

GRANT USE OF TABLESPACE USERSPACE1 TO GROUP WP_BASE_CONFIG_USERS


SYMPTOM
The ConfigWizard fails on Step 4, the Setup database step


CAUSE
This DB2 error can be interpreted this way: 

SQLCODE=-204 means the execution was not successful 

SQLSTATE=42704 means unidentified object name 

SQLERRMC=USERSPACE1 means this specific object was not found 

 

Based on the original SQL statement this means that the tablespace USERSPACE1 does not exist in the DB2 database 


ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8.5 

AIX


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These tablespaces and other database objects are created during Step 3 of the ConfigWizard. Please have the DBA ensure these objects were indeed created properly.
