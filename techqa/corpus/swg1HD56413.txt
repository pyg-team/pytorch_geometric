   Correction Explanation
   Removing some generated dimensions, links on
   associated 3D constraints are created in order to
   not re-generate the same dimensions at next
   automatic generation of dimensions. These links
   were not correctly rerouted when edit / links /
   replacing. This problem has been corrected. There
   is no more ghost links after edit\links\replace on
   this drawing. It is not possible to remove these
   ghost links launching the CATDUA tool.
   There are two possibilities to remove the ghost
   links:
   .
   A -
   Select a view (the first one for example)
   Edit \ links \ Replace
   Select the same CATPart already pointed (Pointed
   Document).
   Update the view
   Save the drawing
   No more ghost links can be observed.
   B -
   .
   1. Activate a view.
   2. Tools \ dimension Generation \ Filters...check
   the retrieve excluded constraints button. click ok.
   save the drawing. No more ghost links observed
   But, if the generating dimension command is
   launch, dimensions previously deleted by the user
   will reappear. Note that it will be possible to
   remove them again and that will be correctly
   managed.
   .
   Answer and By-Pass
   No CATDUA rule can remove this ghost link. Use
   Tools \ Dimension Generation \ Filters...
   or Edit \Links\ Replace on a view with the same
   CATPart.
