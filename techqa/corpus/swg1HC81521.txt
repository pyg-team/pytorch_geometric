ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PRODUCT LINE: V5..  LEVEL: R503. SP LEVEL APPLIED: SP4.........
   OPERATING SYSTEM: IN  OPERATING SYSTEM LEVEL: NT 4.0......
   
     ABSTRACT: ASSEMBLY - Replacement components do not keep color,
   position  or no show status............................
   
   Operating System:  Windows NT/Intel V4 SP4
   
   Problem Description:
   
   Replacement components do not keep the color, position,
   and no-show state in scenes.  The problem can be examined
   using the attached files.
   1. Open
   CATASMConnector_Assembly_6_with_Scenes_for_replace.CATProd
   uct
   2. Open the scene named All Components Exploded and
   observed that one of the screws is colored gold and in an
   exploded position.  Also observe that the other screw is
   no-shown.
   3. Replace both screws with button.CATPart.
   4. Open the scene again.
   5. Notice that the screws did not keep the color,
   position, and no-show state in the scene.
   Bert, please inform Dassault level 2 that during a 1/24/00
   telecon, Olivier Baude stated that this problem is an
   acceptable PMR (in fact, he requested it).

   Hello Bert,
   This problem is considered as an enhancement request and cannot
   be handle via a PMR.
   Try by the normal way, because PMR is only used for defect.
   Thanks for your cooperation.
   Best Regards, Yvan CANTOU.
   
   FUP for Darrens response.

   This PMR was submitted at the request of Olivier Baude to get
   this fixed
   The discussion took place on 24 January, 2000.  Therefore please
   open the APAR so that we can get this problem fixed.
   Thanks Bert
   
   Update From CANTOU Yvan        00/03/23
   Hello Bert,
   This problem is known by Olivier Baude. Development team works
   on the subject.
   A correction will be available on V5R4 GA, and Olivier does not
   want any APAR for this problem. Be confident and patient.
   So, please wait the V5R4 level to test this enhancement, and
   advise.
   Thanks for your cooperation.
   Best Regards, Yvan CANTOU.
   
   FUP for V5R4 GA level testing.
   Thanks Bert

   A couple of items to note here.  This PMR was opened by IBM at
   the
   request of Dassault, so that the problem got addressed.  What is
   really
   concerning us now is that we were at CVI last week and saw no
   evidence
   of this item, yet no APAR has been opened.  This concerns us
   because
   we are now worried that this problem will not be fixed in R4 GA
   as
   promised.  Please follow up on this.
   Thanks Bert

   HC65610 has been created for this problem.
   
     00/05/23-17:19
    When APAR HC65610 is closed, a follow up call will be created
   on queue V5MDA,188.

    APAR HC65610 which was subscribed to by FITZGIBBONS, BERT P.
    has now been closed.
   
   00/12/11
   
   Dassault,  We have tested this on V5R5 SP1 and we do not see
   this as
   being fixed yet.  In fact now both buttons are no inactivated in
   the
   scene.
   Please review and reopen APAR.
   Thanks Bert

   Hello Bert,
   I have tried to reproduce your issue without success on NT in
   V5R5SP1.
   Here's the scenario I have followed :
   1. Open
   CATASMConnector_Assembly_6_with_Scenes_for_replace.CATProduct
   2. Open the scene named All Components Exploded and
    observe that one of the screws is colored gold and in an
    exploded position.  Also observe that the other screw is
    no-shown.
   -> 3. Switch the colored gold screw to grey color and make
   appear the
   other screw by the function Hide/Show and leave the scene.
      4. Open the scene again.
      5. The screws keep their color, and they are both in show
   state in
   the scene.
   Thanks for your collaboration.
   Best regards.

   Per Alain LeFloch we are still seeing a problem here.  In fact
   the parts
   that are now replaced are inactivated in the scene.  This has
   been seen
   on the V5R5 SP2 level code.  Please test again and let us know
   if you
   are seeing the same thing.
   Thanks Bert

   $$RSPMNT=CAJ$$ <=
   Hello Bert,
   I had tested your issue in V5R5SP2 with the scenario I sent you.
   I have tried again in V5R5SP2 with adding a new step like the
   following
   : 6. Both screws are grey. I have changed one of them again from
   grey
   color to gold color : it may prove that parts are active,
   doesn't it?
   Please tell me if you agree with this step.
   Thanks and best regards.

   Hello Christophe,  we just learned from Jacques Bacry that the
   code to
   fix this problem is activated with the variable REPLACEREF=1. So
   far it
   seems to work.  Can you confirm that this code is officially
   supported
   by Dassault.
   Thanks Alain and Bert

   Hello Alain, hello Bert,
   I confirm you that this code is supported by DS and there should
   be no
   problem in future with V5R5 and V5R6.
   Best regards.

   WE are going to hold this PMR open until R6 to see it without
   the use
   of the Variable.  Moving FUP to V5R6 GA level testing.

   The problem is not fixed in V5R6 GA code. Please send us a new
   target
   date,
   Thanks Alain and Bert
   
   01/05/31
   
                     for it being fixed?

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
     DMUNav - REPLACEMENT COMPONENTS DO NOT KEEP COLOR, POSITIO
   N OR NO SHOW STATUS IN SCENES
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   
    TECHNICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE RESTRICTION:
   This problem only occurs with Products and parts from pre-R4
   SP1.
   The replace have changed in R6 : We now do a "change reference"
   with the new products so we keep the instance informations like
   color, show-noshow status etc ....
   On the contrary, on old products (pre V5R4SP1) whe still do a
    delete of the old product then an add of new one. No instance
   info is kept. The only info kept is the position which is an
    product attribut.
