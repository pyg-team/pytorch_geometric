ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ISSUE
   In Portlet Factory 6.0.2.1: when you try to get the SQL Builder
   to work with Oracle stored procedures, and use the database
   explorer, WPF finds the procedure and even creates sample SQL
   for it, however this does not execute properly. Even the
   signature for the PL/SQL stored procedure is wrong (too many
   input/output parameters)
   
   db_utils model has a bug that's preventing proper parameter /
   sql statement values in certain instances
   
   SYMPTOMS
   SQL procedure has incorrect parameters
   
   ENVIRONMENT
   Client: Win XP, SP2,WPF6.0.1,Eclipse3.2,Apache Tomcat 5.5.26
           WAS: 6.0.2.23,Portal: 6.0.1.3, Oracle 10g
   
   RECREATION:
   
   Perform the following steps:
          * configure and test datasource in Tomcat
          * start Tomcat and create new Model in WPF
          * deploy new model to Tomcat and test if it runs
          * configure service provider and enable testing support
          ---
          * add new SQL Call builder and provide name for it, and
            fetch datasources and select datasource
          * check 'stored procedure'
          * open database explorer and fetch entity names
          * pick stored procedure we want to use
          * press button "Generate sample SQL"
          * apply sample SQL
   
   These steps all work, however once we run the model, we get an
   error message from the Oracle jdbc driver.  This error message
   essentially points out that the input and output parameters and
   types that the SQL call builder found for our stored procedure
   do not match with the actual stored procedure.
   For example, if the stored procedure has 2 input and 3 outouts,
   the sample SQL could have a total of 8 (not 5).
