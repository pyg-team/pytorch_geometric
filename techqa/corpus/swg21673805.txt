QUESTION
 DB2 FAQ: This document contains Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about IBM Data Server Driver Package (A lightweight deployment solution for IBM database applications ).


ANSWER
The IBM Data Server Driver Package (also referred to as the DS driver package) can be used to provide runtime support for various applications that interact with DB2 for Linux®, UNIX®, and Windows®, z/OS®, IBM i®, and Informix® databases through APIs, including ODBC/CLI, .NET, and JDBC. The IBM Data Server Driver Package supports open source and Java™, as well as applications that use ODBC, OLE DB, and .NET provider. It has a small footprint and is designed to be used by independent software vendors (ISVs) for mass application deployment scenarios that are typical of large enterprises.
