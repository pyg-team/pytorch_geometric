APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The BPC Explorer always shows the element name of a message
   part. In case of a WSDL message that is based on a multipart
   WSDL message, this is not wanted because the names of the parts
   of the message are different but may reference the same element.
   Therefore the same name is shown in the BPC Explorer although
   the part names are different. This fix will make sure that the
   part names are shown instead of the element names of a WSDL
   message. The rendering of elements in subordinate structures is
   not changed with this fix.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The BPC Explorer always shows the element name of a message
   
   part. In case of a WSDL message that is based on a multipart
   WSDL message, this is not wanted because the names of the parts
   of the message are different but may reference the same element.
   Therefore the same name is shown in the BPC Explorer although
   the part names are different. This fix will make sure that the
   part names are shown instead of the element names referenced by
   a WSDL message part. The rendering of elements in subordinate
   structures is not changed with this fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix will be included in 6.2.0.3
