APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer noticed many (around 30) threads in his javacores with
   generically named threads and very similar java stacks:
   
   3XMTHREADINFO      "Thread-80" J9VMThread:0x0000000026D8FB00,
   j9thread_t:0x0000004808BA58F0,

   java/lang/Thread.run(Thread.java:784)
   3XMTHREADINFO3           No native callstack available on this
   platform
   
   Further analysis of dumps showed that the threads are part of a
   pool of threads of type
   java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker
   
   and
   final java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor this$0
   
   points to
    com/ibm/ws/session/WsSessionInvalidatorWithThreadPool$Scheduled
   Executor
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A, the threads are valid WAS threads and are there by design
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   *                  V8.0 and V8.5                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WAS Session Invalidator threads are     *
   *                      generically named Thread-XX             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Session Invalidator threads are currently given a generic thread
   name, which can cause difficulty in assessing resource
   allocation
   and debugging issues with hung threads.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The name of these threads were renamed to
   'WsSessionInvalidatorThread'.
   
   APAR PI44496 is currently targeted for inclusion in Fix Packs
   8.0.0.12 and 8.5.5.9.
