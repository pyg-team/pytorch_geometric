PK13068 resolves the following problem:

ERROR DESCRIPTION: 
The following exception is thrown in the adminconsole during application deployment/update. 

ADMA8019E : The resources that are assigned to the application are beyond the deployment target scope. 

Even though we have defined a resource of type workmanager, the class which picks up the resources bindings present in the environment for validating the resource bindings contained in an application 
seems to ignore the binding of type workmanager found in the environment. 

Workmanager has been configured as follows. 
AdminConsole > Resources > AsynchBean > WorkManager > 
scope (Server=server1)> 
Create New WorkManager(myWorkManager, wm/myWorkManager). 

LOCAL FIX: 
NA 

PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
WebSphereÂ® Application Server users of version 6.0.2.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Resource validation failed with error message ADMA8019E stating
"TypeMismatch", for the resources J2CActivationSpec and MailSession.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

Validation for WebSphere resources J2CActivationSpec and MailSession are failing during application deployment. In the application, resources are defined as JMS and MailProvider. Resource validation code should map JMS resource definitions against J2CActivationSpec resource, and MailProvider against MailSession resource. 

Since resource definitions in the application are valid, application management code should not thrown any false validation warnings.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 
Identified the root cause where appmanagement code fails to validate these resources, and made appropriate changes to validate JMS resource against J2CActivationSpec and MailProvider resource against MailSession. 

The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fixpack 6.0.2.9.
