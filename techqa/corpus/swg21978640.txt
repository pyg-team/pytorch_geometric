Title: IBM Unable to see Microsoft Office files with macro enabled format in IBM® Content Navigator for Microsoft Office (NMO). - United States

Text:
NMO; application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet. macroEnabled.12 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When add a Microsoft Office files with macro enabled format (e.g. .xlsm file) to IBM Content Navigator, this file might not be shown on IBM® Content Navigator for Microsoft Office (NMO). 

SYMPTOM
The mime type of the macro enabled excel file is "application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet. macroEnabled.12". NMO uses the file types defined in the administrator configuration to determine whether to show it when browsing. It appears that mime type was not included in the Excel file type by default. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To add this mime type: 

1. Login to ICN Admin Desktop with the ICN administrative role. 

2. Go to settings page, under general tab, find "File type filters" section. 

3. Click on "Excel" and edit. 

4. From the "available MIME Types", find "application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet. macroEnabled.12" and add it to "selected MIME Types". 

5. After a restart on NMO, the file with this MIME Type should show up.
