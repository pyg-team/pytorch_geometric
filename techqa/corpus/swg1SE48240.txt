APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the project has a remote location with a path that contains
   spaces problems will be seen after the first build is done.
   
   After editing a COBOL source file in the project an error like
   "'Downloding copybooks for /direct ory/file.cbl' has encountered
   a problem."will be seen.  This will happen every time the file
   is parsed - when the file is opened and after every change in
   the editor.  The directory and file names in the message will
   point to the file in the project that encountered the problem.
   The message details will contain:
   
   An internal error occurred during: "Downloading copybooks for
   /direct ory/file.cbl"
   java.lang.NullPointerException
   
   Because of this error the copybook will not be loaded causing
   annotations marking COPY statements, and statements containing
   any symbols defined in those copybooks, to be in error.
