APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I don't have XMI import and XMI export available in my tools men
   u. I know that my license file shows FEATURE RPXMI.
   
   During installation I did not select the XMI-option, but I added
    that later (Control Panel ? Add or Remove programs, then change
    the Rhapsody installations and add XMI support).
   
   I investigated the problem and found out that it is a Java issue
   . Adding XMI Toolkit later (using the Change option from the Con
   trol Panel?Add or Remove Programs, or by rerunning the installer
   ) does not work. The only way to get this to work is by complete
   ly de-install Rhapsody, removing the remaining files in the Rhap
   sody installation folder (including rhapsody.ini) and re-install
    Rhapsody Developer again. And you have to install Rhapsody Deve
   loper for Java and not only C and/or C++. This way the installer
    knows where to find Java and installs the XMI Toolkit correctly
   . If you don't select Rhapsody for Java the XMI toolkit will not
    be installed correctly.
   
   Removing the XMI Toolkit and add it again will not work, because
    installing a second time fails.
   
   Another issue is that if you don't have a Java JRE installed no
   error message is given during installation of the XMI Toolkit. I
   t just fails (even the first time).
   
   I added an investigation report describing the things I did to f
   ind the problem.
