VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6303 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6303]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function. By using unknown attack vectors, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2180 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6305 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6305]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in SSL_peek(). By sending specially crafted data, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the service to hang.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117111 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117111] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6308 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6308]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error in dtls1_preprocess_fragment() prior to the excessive message length check. By initiating multiple connection attempts, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large DTLS message to exhaust all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117114 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117114] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2181 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2181]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the DTLS replay protection implementation. By sending a specially crafted sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause valid packets to be dropped.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344] for the current score
