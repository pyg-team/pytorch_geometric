QUESTION
 What is the recommended method of adding custom jar file(s) to a ISIM 6 environments? 

CAUSE
The recommended method was to add the custom jar file(s) under the enRole.ear and then update the MANIFEST.MF file. If you applied a ITIM fix, this process had to be repeated. This has changed in ITIM 5.x.

ANSWER
A shared library is configured during the installation that makes the process easier and preserves the custom jar file additions across fix packs. 

One way to accomplish this is to add the custom jar file(s) to the existing ITIM_LIB shared library by first placing the custom jar file(s) in the <ITIM-HOME>/lib directory (or really any directory, as long as it's named the same on all nodes in a clustered configuration). This directory needs to be named the same on each node in a cluster. Then go into the WAS Console and do the following:


 * Expand Environment 
 * Click on "Shared Libraries" (make sure the scope is set to "All Scopes") 
 * Click on "ITIM_LIB" 
 * Add the custom jar file(s) to the "Classpath" box (place the custom jar file(s) at the bottom). If the custom jar(s) are found in the <ITIM-HOME>/lib directory, they can be entered as "${ITIM_HOME}/custom.jar" 
 * Save the configuration 
 * Restart the ITIM Application Server(s)
   

The one draw back of the above definition is that the out of the box ITIM_LIB definition is being changed and if this is done incorrectly, the entire ITIM Application could be impacted. 
A better way to accomplish this is to create a new shared library (CUSTOM_LIB) just for customizations. To accomplish this do the following via the WAS Console: 
 * Expand Environment 
 * Click on "Shared Libraries" (make sure the scope is set to "All Scopes") 
 * Review the ITIM_LIB shared library to identify the scope at which to define the CUSTOM_LIB and then click Cancel 
 * Select the scope at which ITIM_LIB was defined and then click on New to create the new shared library. Enter the Name as "CUSTOM_LIB", Description as "Customization shared library for ITIM" and Classpath as "${ITIM_HOME}/lib/custom.jar". Then click OK. 
 * Expand Applications 
 * Click on Enterprise Applications 
 * Click on "ITIM" 
 * Under "References" click on "Shared Library References" 
 * Select "ITIM" and then click on "Reference shared libraries" 
 * Select "CUSTOM_LIB" in the "Available" list box and click on the >> button to move it to the "Selected" list box 
 * Click OK 
 * Save the configuration 
 * Restart the ITIM Application Server(s)
   

Once the CUSTOM_LIB is created, additional custom jar files can be added to the CUSTOM_LIB shared library.
