APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When importing a paa via Site Builder on Linux/Unix based on
   Portal 8001 where the paa was exported via Site Builder onto a
   MS Windows based Portal, the import claims it was successful
   but
   no new artifacts appears.
   The issue is in the wp.paa.support code that Site Builder uses
   to export. The PAA file has zip entries with mixed slashes
   (i.e. /something\else\here instead of /something/else/here).
   This causes the zip to be improperly read during import.
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Open the PAA files and re-zip it as PAA before importing
