QUESTION
Does IBM WebSphere Portal version 6.1 support Application Server version 7.0?

ANSWER
Beginning with the release of WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0.1, installing and running on WebSphere Application Server version 7.0 is supported, but the Portal does not fully exploit its capabilities when compared to Application Server version 6.1.
No previous releases of WebSphere Portal will support Application Server V7.0, including version 6.1.0.0, even when upgraded to version 6.1.0.1 by applying a fix pack. The installation images for version 6.1.0.1 or 6.1.5.0 must be used to install against an existing Application Server version 7.0. There is no media or included license for Application Server version 7.0 provided in any WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0.1 or 6.1.5.0 packaging, edition, or e-Assembly.

Application Server version 7.0 licensing, installation media or images must be obtained separately.

To install the Portal V6.1.0.1 onto Application Server version 7.0, first install the Application Server and all required additional fixes as described in the document, "Required WebSphere Interim Fixes for WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg24021049]" (#4021049 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg24021049]). When installing the Portal, it will create a new profile specifically for your portal instance.

Additional notes:


 * When using the graphical installation routine, you must choose to 'install onto an existing installation of WebSphere Application Server' or the installer will also install Application Server version 6.1.

 * When installing coexisting Application Server instances (for example, versions 6.1 and 7.0 on the same system), you must ensure that server1 and WebSphere Portalare running so that the ports in use are found and avoided by the new installation.

 * If the registry entries for Application Server verions 7.0 and the vpd.properties file are removed for some reason, the Portal installation will not find the Application Server on which to install.

 * Migration to WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0.1 or higher fix pack level deployed on Application Server V7.0 from a previous release of WebSphere Portal is not supported. Refer to the "Planning for migration [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v6101/migrate/mig_plan_checklist.html?resultof=%22%56%37%2e%30%22%20]" topic in the WebSphere Portal V6.1.0.1 Information Center for more information.
