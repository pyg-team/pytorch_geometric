Title: IBM Comparison method violates its general contract when installing CICS Explorer SDK - United States

Text:
An internal error occurred during Install download1 ; Comparison method violates its general contract ; Multiple problems have occurred; 5655Y0400 R680 680 R800 800 HCI6800 5655-Y04 5655Y04 KIXINFO kixdcfcic680 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are installing the CICS Explorer SDK into Eclipse V3.6.2 for CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V5.1. The install fails and displays a message box that says "Multiple problems have occurred" and 'An internal error occurred during "Install download1". Comparison method violates its general contract!' 

SYMPTOM
Installation of the CICS Explorer SDK fails and displays this pop-up: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21614755&amp;aid=1]

There is no log file created. 


CAUSE
Running on a local Javaâ„¢ 7 JVM.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To determine if you are running Java 7 JRE, type java -version into a command line. In Windows, select Start > Run then enter cmd to bring up the command prompt tool.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Continue to use Java 7, but add the following lines to your eclipse.ini: 


-vmargs
-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true 

If you already have a -vmargs line in the file, don't add another, just add the line beginning -D to the end of the file.

In Windows, edit eclipse.ini using Wordpad rather than Notepad to avoid corrupting the file.

This new system property forces JDK 7 to use the previous sorting algorithm and bypasses the problem.

Alternatively, use an older JRE like Java 6.
