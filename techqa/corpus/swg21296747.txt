QUESTION
Your WebSphereÂ® Portal server is configured with an LDAP server and you would like to profile your models based on the LDAP group that a user belongs to. How can this be accomplished? 

ANSWER
Ensure that the LDAP groups in question are visible in your WebSphere Portal. You can do so by going to Administration -> Access -> Users and Groups. 


Once you have verified that the LDAP groups are visible in Portal, you can then configure your Profile Selection Handler to use the "WPS Group Segment Handler".

And then you can set the profile sets based on the WPS Groups by editing the profile, and in the Advanced section, click "Add External". You should now be able to type in the name of the LDAP group that you want to profile against. You should be able to set up any number of profiles for all LDAP groups in question.
