ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ODI file DOCKCP does not define the AREA attribute of the
   CICSSTOR table as part of the priamry key, so the Summarization
   and Pruning Agent sums all area types into a single record,
   setting the AREA value to that of the highest detailed record
   found. In this case the EDSA.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. All changes related here are to be made to the machine
   where the TEPS and/or Summarisation & Pruning agent runs.
   2. Locate the file named DOCKCP on the target machine, from the
   documentation supplied, this is most probably in
   /opt/IBM/ITM/ls3266/cq/data
   3. Take a backup copy of the file, named something like
   BACKUP.DOC.KCP - it is important not to use a filename with
   'DOCKCP' as part of it, as ITM has a habit of finding old files
   this way.
   4.Open the DOCKCP file with an editor.
   5. Use a find function to find the CICSSTOR section - you will
   see it starts with a line
   *REM: ..... ZGENDOC ..... CICSSTOR (HKC5420).
   6. After five (5) further *REM lines that detail changes made to
   the table over time, you will see
   *TABLE:     CICSSTOR
   This is the start of the table definitions
   7. About forty nine (49) lines further on you will see the lines
   *ATTR:      Area
   *COLUMN:    AREA
   *SHARE:     Y
   .... and so on....
   8. Add a line after the COLUMN definition to add a line *OPTION:
   PRIMARYKEY=1, thus
   *ATTR:      Area
   *COLUMN:    AREA
   *OPTION:    PRIMARYKEY=1
   *SHARE:     Y
   .... and so on
   9. Save the file
   10. Re-start the TEPS and the S&P agent.
   
   The TEPS needs to be re-started to get new DOCKCP.
   
   Then the S&P agent needs to be restarted to query TEMS and get
   new summarisation controls.
   Note that only data summarised AFTER S&P agent is re-started
   will have the new AREA format. If the customer displays any data
   from prior to the restart this will displayed in the 'wrong'
   format.
