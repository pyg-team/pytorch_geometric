APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An installation has two queue managers on the same machine.  The
   channels are started from one queue manager and the channels
   start with no problem.  If an attempt to start the channels is
   made from the second queue manager, the channels either stay in
   BINDING / INITIALIZING state or fail with one of two messages:
   .
      AMQ9502 Type of channel not suitable for action requested.
   or
      AMQ9514 Channel is in Use.
   .
   This is a result of connecting to the wrong subpool to find an
   amqrmppa process to run a channel.  The amqrmppa process for the
   failing channel on queue manager 2 was associating with queue
   manager 1 improperly.
   .
   This can be detected by amqrdbgm 'e' (Pool entry) & 'l' (Dump
   pool) and a process list.  This is also associated with files
   remaining in the ...qmgrs/@qmpersist subdirectories from a
   previous instance of the queue manager.
