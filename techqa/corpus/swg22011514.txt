RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Go to your cognos installation folder ensure you have the latest jar files in your drivers (in this particular case updating to JDBC 4.2 driver fixed the issue). If you don't have newer drives, go to a third party website and install JDBC 4.2 driver for SQL Server 

 Here are the steps: 
- Ensure in the <installation_folder>/drivers/ contains sqljdbc42.jar (or any higher version)
- Delete: The two mssql-jdbc*.jar files in the same folder.
- Restart Cognos services.
