QUESTION
 Are there easy documented steps to install the WebLogic server on any Unix platform? 

ANSWER
If you want to install the WebLogic server, these are the steps on an AIX platform. Note that the installation is typically done on a Solaris OS but I've seen it work on other Unix platforms too. 

To see the list of officially supported WebLogic versions, please see here:
