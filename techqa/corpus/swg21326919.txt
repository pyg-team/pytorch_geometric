 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 OmniFind™ Enterprise Edition, Version 8.5 Fix Pack 1, provides support for searching WebSphere® Portal, Version 6.1 data sources, including support for secure search. How do I configure the crawler? 

ANSWER
To crawl WebSphere Portal 6.1 sources, configure a Seed list crawler, not a WebSphere Portal crawler. You can continue using the WebSphere Portal crawler to crawl earlier versions of WebSphere Portal. 

If you plan to enable document-level security, you must run a setup script that is provided with OmniFind Enterprise Edition on the WebSphere Portal server before you configure the crawler. The procedure is almost same as the procedure for running the setup script for WebSphere Portal 6.0. The only difference is that you must use the es.wp61.install.jar file instead of the es.wp6.install.jar file.

As in previous releases of OmniFind Enterprise Edition, support for secure search in collections that include WebSphere Portal documents is available only for queries that are handled through the Search portlet in WebSphere Portal (ESSearchPortlet), not stand-alone search applications. 

 

When you configure a Seed list crawler in the enterprise search administration console, the following parameters are required: 

 * Protocol: Select the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that you want the crawler to use to connect to the data source server. 
 * Host name: Specify the fully qualified domain name of the data source server (for example, example.ibm.com). 
 * Port: Specify the port number where the server is available (for example, 10038). 
 * User DN: Specify the user name or distinguished name of a WebSphere Portal administrator (for example, uid=wpsadmin,o=organization). 
 * Password: Specify the password for the WebSphere Portal administrator.


Additional parameters are available for advanced configurations. These parameters are the same as those that you configure in the WebSphere Portal crawler configuration panels. RELATED INFORMATION
