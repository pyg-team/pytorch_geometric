LOCAL FIX
 *  The FFST can be avoided by switching off MQ trace.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of of WebSphere MQ 7.5 on Solaris
   x86-64 who have configured queue manager access controls using
   Channel Authentication (CHLAUTH) rules of type BLOCKUSER and who
   enable MQ trace using the strmqtrc command.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Solaris x86-64
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The problem occurred when MQ trace was started on the queue
   manager and a client application was connected.  To trace the
   connection the queue manager attempted to print a string whose
   value was a 0 (null) pointer which resulted in a SIGSEGV and the
   queue manager's amqrmppa process terminating.  The client
   connection attempt was unsuccessful.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ queue manager logic has been corrected to prevent a null
   pointer access in this scenario.
