APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser client versions 6.2.1.0-TIV-I
   TM-IF0003 and 6.2.1.0-TIV-ITM-IF0002
     The latest patch level breaks functionality.
   
   Problem Description:
     After upgrade to ITM 6.2.1.0-TIV-ITM-IF0003, client connects
   using the browser client to IF0003 TEPS.  After doing so
   customer unable to connect to IF0002 TEPS due to incompatible
   dll's in the webrenderswing code.  Workaround from IZ39414 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ39414]
   alleviates the failure to connect back to IF0002 TEPS.
   
   Detailed recreate procedure:
   
   Install ITM 6.21.00.02 TEPS.
   Connect using the browser client to ITM 6.21.00.02 TEPS.
   Install ITM 6.21.00.03 TEPS.
   Connect using the browser client to ITM 6.21.00.03 TEPS.
   Disconnect from ITM 6.21.00.03 TEPS and attempt reconnect to ITM
   6.21.00.02 TEPS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add the parameter:
   document.writeln( '<PARAM NAME="cnp.browser.installdir"
   VALUE="C:/myInstallDir">' );
   
   Adding this parameter will allow for webrender in IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring version 6.21.00.02 or 6.21.00.03 to write to an
   alternate directory from the default, thus avoiding the confilct
   of two different versions of webrenderer trying to access the
   same default dll directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After installing itm621_if3 and running the Portal Client
   browser or java web start client you are unable to point the
   back to the itm621_if2 or lower system on the same desktop
   machine.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Add changes to the Portal Client Browser view to ensure the
   webrenderer files that are written to the end users desktop get
   placed in a unique directory for each version of webrenderer we
   ship with IBM Tivoli Monitoring.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle:
       | interim fix | 6.2.1-TIV-ITM-IF0004
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Add the cnp.browser.installdir parameter to the Portal Client
   applet.html or tep.jnlp file for the itm621_if3 system. This
   will ensure the IF3 files are written to a directory that is
   different than the default user.home directory. This way two
   Portal Client clients can run at the same time on the same end
   user machine each pointing to a different Portal Client server
   at different maintenance levels.
