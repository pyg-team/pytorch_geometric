ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deleting correct "Authorization Profiles" on an SAP account
   not working consistently
   
   
   Assigned 3 authorization profiles to an existing account
   (T999999pj):
   
   SAP_NEW_21C - Authorizations for new objects added Rel. 2.1C
   SAP_NEW_21D - Authorizations for New Objects Added Rel. 2.1D
   SAP_NEW_22A - Authorizations for New Objects Added Rel. 2.2A
   
   Logged in to SAP using the account (T999999pj) and confirmed
   that these
   authorization profiles were assigned to the user.
   
   Deleted the "SAP_NEW_22A - Authorizations for New Objects Added
   Rel. 2.2
   A" authorization role.
   
   
   ITIM reported success, but on the target SAP instance, I found
   that
   "SAP_NEW_21C - Authorizations for new objects added Rel. 2.1C"
   was
   deleted instead!
   
   Went back in ITIM and deleted "SAP_NEW_21C - Authorizations for
   new
   objects added Rel. 2.1C".
   
   Again ITIM reported a success but on the target SAP instance, I
   found
   that "SAP_NEW_21D - Authorizations for New Objects Added Rel.
   2.1D" was
   deleted!
   
   The end state was ITIM having "SAP_NEW_21D - Authorizations for
   New
   Objects Added Rel. 2.1D" authorization profile on the account
   while SAP
   showed the user having "SAP_NEW_22A - Authorizations for New
   Objects
   Added Rel. 2.2A" authorization profile.
   
   Customer points out similarity to apar IZ08011 but that isssue
   specifically addresses AUTHORIZATION ROLES - not authorization
   profiles.
   
   Dev recommended that customer upgrade to the latest librfc32.dll
   and
   retest.  Customer upgraded to librfc32.dll v7000.0.183.5955 and
   still
   experiences the issue.  Using customer's latest version of
   librfc32.dll
   dev was able to reproduce the issue and recommended that the PMR
   generate an apar.
   
   Environment:
