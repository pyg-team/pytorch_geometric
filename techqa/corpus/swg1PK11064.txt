ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Submission type: DEFECT
   Operating system: Windows XP SP2
   ClearCase version: 2003.06 all service releases
   Could repro: Yes
   Problem Description:
   When a user disconnects a mapped drive to the view root, the
   mapping persists in Windows Explorer in a stale state.
   To reproduce:
   1. In Windows Explorer map a drive to the view root directory
   \\view\<view tag>  (Toos>Map Network Drive... and select
   Reconnect at logon)
   2. Log-off the PC and then login
   
   3. In Windows Explorer disconnect the mapped drive
   (Tools>Disconnect Network Drive...)
   
   Running the net use command will show that the drive is now
   disconnected. However Windows Explorer shows the folder is
   still assigned to the network drive.  If you  try to select
   that drive you get the following error:
   
   
   
   Z:\ refers to a location that is unavailable. It  could be on a
   hard
   drive on this computer, or on a network. Check to make sure
   that the
   disk is properly inserted, or that you are connected to the
   Internet or
   your network, and then try again. If it still cannot be
   located, the
   information  might have been moved to a different  location.
   Additional:
   -Windows XP SP1 and Windows 2000 SP4 does not exhibit this
   behaviour.
   -This problem only occurs with network drives mapped to the
   ClearCase view root.
   -Disconnecting the mapping with netuse \d and\or subst /d does
   not make a difference.
   -It does not matter if the view_server process is started or
   stopped prior to disconnecting the mapped drive.
   -Windows Explorer is not configured to launch folder windows in
   a separate process.
   -The following Windows fixes have been tested without success:

   Workaround:
   A restart of the PC usually corrects the problem. I have found
   no other workarounds.
   I am not sure what team this should be assigned to, so I am
   going to start with the MVFS team.  This might be a Vendor
   defect or an integration issue.
