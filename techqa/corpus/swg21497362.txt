Title: IBM Unable to login to FileNet Workplace XT - United States

Text:
Invalid Credentials; User must change password at next logon TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do users receive an, "Invalid Credentials" Error when logging into Workplace XT after changing the, "User must change password at next logon", parameter in Microsoft Active Directory? 

CAUSE
This is by design.

ANSWER
The application is receiving something other than a valid login response from the directory service and is responding accordingly. There is not a way to fulfill the directory service requirement to change the password before logging into the Workplace XT application from the web client.
