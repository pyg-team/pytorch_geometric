Title: IBM Issues when generating a WebSphere DataPower error report - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have tried to generate an error report from the DataPower WebGUI but receive these error messages:

Error Report redirected to temporary due to operational state
Error Report failed creation for 'temporary:///error-report.68A2354.20110429102746DST.txt.gz' previous error report generation failed
Could not write error report to 'temporary:///error-report.68A2354.20110429102746DST.txt.gz'

How can I resolve this issue and generate error reports again? 

CAUSE
Severe error occurred when generating a previous error report.

ENVIRONMENT
DataPower appliance.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This message indicates that the firmware has automatically reloaded due to a
severe error when it was creating an error report. The firmware then keeps
information indicating it may not be safe to generate another error report since the previous attempt failed. 

When this issue occurs: 

 * show failure-notification should report 'down' with a result code that reads 'previous error report generation failed'. This would explain the message "Error Report redirected to temporary due to operational state". 
 * Error Reports will immediately fail to generate since the firmware believes it is not safe to do so. The appliance rebooted/restarted the last time when trying to generate a report. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Rebooting the appliance is the only way to clear this "state" so the error reports can be generated again.
