Title: IBM Error 7002 symptom 12 when connecting SPSS product concurrent licensing client to 8.3 or earlier versions of the License Manager. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I recently installed one or more IBM SPSS Statistics 24/Modeler 18.0/Amos 24.0 products as concurrent licensing clients. 

When trying to connect to the License manager verion 8.2.x. installed, I receive error:

Error # 7002 There is no license for SPSS for Windows. This command not executed. Specific symptom number: 12 

I can see the license was added to the License Manager and it is a valid 24 Concurrent license. Other SPSS products licensing from the same License Manager are able to receive a license without error.

What is happening? 

CAUSE
The 8.6.1 licensing code components implemented in IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0/Modeler 18.0/Amos 24.0 are not compatible with 8.3 or earlier versions of the License Manager.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To license IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0/Modeler 18.0/Amos 24.0 concurrent licensing clients will require an upgrade to at least an 8.5 version of the License Manager.
