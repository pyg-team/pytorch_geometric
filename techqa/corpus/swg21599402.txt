QUESTION
 When IBM Case Manager is configured for Single Sign-On (SSO) with Tivoli Access Manager or Kerberos/SPNEGO, what is the correct procedure to log out from Case Manager Client? 

ANSWER
When IBM Case Manager is configured for SSO with Tivoli Access Manager or Kerberos/SPNEGO or CA SiteMinder, the user should close the browser to log out of the current Case Manager Client session.
