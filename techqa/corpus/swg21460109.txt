 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I want to update the Optim™ v2.2 solution components that are installed at my enterprise. However, some computers at my enterprise cannot access the update repositories online. Can I update computers that are not connected to the Internet? 

ANSWER
You can download a ZIP or TAR file that contains the update repositories. (Download the ZIP file for Windows computers, and download the TAR file for AIX®, Linux, or Solaris computers.) Then, extract the downloaded file to a folder on the network drive. Finally, run IBM® Installation Manager, add the update repositories, and update your components from the downloaded repositories. 

The ZIP or TAR file that contains the update repositories can be downloaded from this location. 
http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v75/nex/zips/ [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v75/nex/zips/]

Access this location using a web browser and find the link to the ZIP or TAR file that you need. 


 * Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: 
   Optim_221_GA.zip or Optim_221_GA.tar

 * Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: 
   SOA_222_UPDATE_20110503.zip or SOA_222_UPDATE_20110503.tar.gz


When you have found the link to the desired ZIP or TAR file, right-click the link, click Save Link As or Save Target As, and save the file. 

Next, extract the ZIP or TAR file to a folder on a network drive. If you are using an AIX or Solaris computer to extract a TAR file, use the GNU TAR utility to extract the file. The TAR file contains files with long names, and the native AIX and Solaris TAR utilities cannot extract this file properly. 

The locations of the repositories are as follows, where %extract_folder% is the folder to which you extracted the ZIP or TAR file. 
 * Optim Designer:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: %extract_folder%\220\designer\updates
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\designer\updates

 * Optim Manager:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: %extract_folder%\220\console\updates
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\console\updates

 * Optim Management Server:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: %extract_folder%\220\server\updates
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\server\updates

 * Optim Proxy:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: %extract_folder%\220\proxy\updates
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\proxy\updates

 * Optim Shared:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: %extract_folder%\220\shared\updates
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\shared\updates

 * WebSphere™ Application Server Community Edition:
   Update from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1: no update for WebSphere Application Server Community Edition
   Update from v2.2.0 or v2.2.1 to v2.2.2: %extract_folder%\soaupd\wasce\updates


For example, if you extract the SOA_222_UPDATE_20110503.zip file to C:\updates on a Windows computer, the Optim Designer repository is located at C:\updates\soaupd\designer\updates. 

Finally, run Installation Manager on the computer on which the Optim solution component is installed and click File > Preferences. Add the location of each of the repositories that you need for the computer, and ensure that Search service repositories during installation and updates is cleared. 

You can now use Installation Manager to update the component from the repositories on the network drive.
