Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document contains information on Turbocore (Extended Cache Option) setting available on some POWER7 servers. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
TurboCore is also referred to as Extended Cache Option (ECO), or Enhanced Cache Mode. In this mode, four of the eight cores are disabled, allowing for a larger L3 cache utilization by the remaining active cores. 

o The four accessible cores also run at a higher frequency in this mode.
o In this mode, there is a maximum of 128 ways (FHB). 8 nodes x 4 SCMs per node x 8/4 cores per SCM.

Requirements
Server Model Power 7 MMB and FHB
At least 3 nodes, all processors must be TurboCore capable (8 core)
eFW7.2 or later firmware
HMC 7.7.2 or later

Changing 
The setting can be altered from HMC GUI, HMC CLI, or ASMI. 
To change using the HMC GUI, you should select the server properties, then click the Advanced tab. Change Display advanced setting to Processor Performance, change Next TurboCore state to the desired setting, and click OK.

The new setting goes into effect on the next platform IPL.
