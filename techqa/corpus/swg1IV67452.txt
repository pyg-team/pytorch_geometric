APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RAS1 logs at default tracing level get flooded by two error
   messages while monitoring network interfaces. These messages
   are related to the loopback and the aggregate interfaces and
   are not really errors.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
     This issue affects all the UNIX OS agent versions since 6.23
     FP1, only on the AIX platform.
   
   Diagnostics:
     (545D00DA.0002-C:kux04agt.cpp,256,"addSTGValues") No STG data
     found for:  'lo0                             '
     (545D01D9.0000-C:kux04agt.cpp,256,"addSTGValues") No STG data
     found for: 'Aggregate                       '
   
   Initial Impact:
     Low, RAS1 logs become harder to review

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: Useless messages flooding RAS1 logs on AIX
    Problem/Problem Summary: RAS1 logs of the Monitoring Agent for
   UNIX OS may become unreadable due to a repeated couple of error
    messages printed while it monitors Network interfaces on AIX:
     "addSTGValues") No STG data found for: 'lo0'
     "addSTGValues") No STG data found for: 'Aggregate'
    They should not be printed at all, as they are of no value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The agent no longer prints these messages.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
