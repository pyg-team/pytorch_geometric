Title: IBM Datastage question about dsjob and DSAPI - United States

Text:
dsjob; dsapi TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does the dsjob command utility internally use the DSAPI (DataStage Development Kit C API) or does it use something different? 

ANSWER
The dsjob command line tool is built on the C dsapi.


The main factor that can affect dsjob performance is the use of domain authentication.


1. If dsjob is invoked with the following arguments: 

 * 
 * 


where aaa is the address of the domain server and bbb/ccc are Information Server credentials 

This calls the domain authentication service which involves the loading of a java runtime in the dsjob process and this can take some time. 
2. If dsjob is invoked without any of the above arguments, it will connect on the local server without 

 authenticating and performance will be better 

 

3. If dsjob is invoked with the following arguments: 

 * 
 * 


This will connect directly to the Engine server zzz and pass OS credentials xxx/yyy 
This avoids the use of domain authentication and therefore the cost of loading the java runtime.
