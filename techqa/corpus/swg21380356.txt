Title: IBM DMS job in Cognos Connection are stuck in executing mode - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The customer had a published DMS task that used a procedure node to call a shell script which executed a number of Data Manager jobs. The job in Cognos Connection remained in executing mode even after the job had completed successfully. The job had to be killed manually 

SYMPTOM
Job executing DMS task in Cognos Connection remains in "Executing" mode after the DMS task completes

CAUSE
The execution of a shell script in this case causes rundsjob and DMrunspec to be executing at the same time - each references the DM_CONTROLLER variable and the two processes are getting confused because each process requires a different value for this variable

ENVIRONMENT
Occurred on Solaris but could affect any unix platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The problem occurs when a DMS task is used to launch a shell script which launches a rundsjob node

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the shell script specifically unset the DM_CONTROLLER variable (unset DM_CONTROLLER)




This should allow the DMS task to return results successfully to Cognos Connection and the job will register as successful
