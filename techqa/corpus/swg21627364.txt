PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM 6.3 ships a new TEPS 64-bit architecture and incompatible 32-bit libraries on Linux. This prevents the ContentCapture viewing functionality from working. 

SYMPTOM
Robotics ContentCapture is not viewable on the TEPS. 

On 32-bit Linux TEPS you see a missing symbol error in the TEPS logs. Enable debug logging first by setting /opt/IBM/ITM/config/cq.ini with 
KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:CTFileXfer ALL) (UNIT:CTServer ALL) 

 

On 64-bit Linux TEPS the lx8266 architecture does not support the content capture libraries.


ENVIRONMENT
ITM 6.3 TEPS (cq) is hosted on Linux


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade TEPS support to version 7.4 which does not suffer from this issue. 

As a workaround, consider placing the TEPS on a different platform or do not upgrade to ITM 6.3.
