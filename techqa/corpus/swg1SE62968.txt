APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): CCSID 5026 lowercase
   Japanese language environment 2962
   
   The word FILLER became fILLER at 8.0.0.3. It was FILLER at 7.1
   and prior release. The customer understands that Job CCSID 5026
   is unsupported by MQ. However, they are expecting MQ to correct
   the typo lowercase characters to uppercase characters from the
   point of view of quality.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   IBM MQ users who utilize the COBOL Copybooks and have jobs which
   cannot handle mixed uppercase and lowercase characters
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   IBM iSeries
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In IBM MQ V8 the "FILLER" padding in the COBOL copybooks is in
   uppercase and lowercase letters, ie "fILLER". For jobs which
   cannot handle lowercase characters, such as in CCSID 5026, this
   results in problems parsing the copybooks.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  While CCSID 5026 is not supported with IBM MQ, the COBOL
   copybooks should be corrected to be all uppercase characters as
   previously.
