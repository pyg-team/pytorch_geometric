ICN case sensitive TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can a search field be enabled as case insensitive in IBM Content Navigator (ICN)? 

ANSWER
ICN does not provide a feature to turn on or off case sensitive searches. All metadata searches in ICN are case sensitive by default. However, depending on the repository, case insensitive searches can be performed by doing the following:
- For FileNet P8 repositories; set the Force Case Insensitive Search flag on the object store. 
- For Content Manager repositories; the administrator will firstly need to enable text search on metadata, then a text search will need to be done in ICN against the metadata by enclosing the metadata value in double quotes.

Alternatively, a request filter can be written to change the case of a query to all upper or all lower case.
