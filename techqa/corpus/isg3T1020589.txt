abstract text
We're running in a 15-way parallel sysplex. I converted some of my DB2 bufferpools so that they're page fixed. I now want to use Large Frames and I have some questions about specifying LFAREA in IEASYS00. If the total amount of page fixed bufferpools is 13GB on one LPAR and I specify LFAREA=15G, what happens to the other 2GB that is eligible forLarge Frames? Is it wasted until I increase my page fixed bufferpools or is it available for general use? What happens if I increase my page fixed bufferpool
