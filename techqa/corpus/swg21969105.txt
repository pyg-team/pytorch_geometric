QUESTION
 NOTIFY_FM_ALARM_LIST_REBUILT : Why does the probe keep resynchronising? 

CAUSE
When the NOTIFY_FM_ALARM_LIST_REBUILT alarm is seen by the probe, it will perform a synchronisation with the 3GPP server.

ANSWER
The 3GPP specification states the NOTIFY_FM_ALARM_LIST_REBUILT event is used to notify clients that alarm list re-alignment is required to avoid event loss. 

As a client, the probe performs a full resynchronization whenever a NOTIFY_FM_ALARM_LIST_REBUILT event is received.


Check the probe log file for these types of messages:

Received a NOTIFY_FM_ALARM_LIST_REBUILT Event
Processing Alert...
Event Processor] domain_name: ALARM IRP V1.0.0
Sending Alert...
Event Processor] EVENT_TYPE: x6
Event Processor] EVENT_NAME:
Event Processor] NV_NOTIFICATION_ID: 11223344556677
Event Processor] NV_REASON: <data>
Event Processor] NV_ALARM_LIST_ALIGNMENT_REQUIREMENT: <data>
Event Processor] NV_MANAGED_OBJECT_CLASS: <data>
Event Processor] NV_MANAGED_OBJECT_INSTANCE: <data>
Event Processor] NV_EVENT_TIME: <MM/DD/YY hh:mm:ss AM/PM>
Event Processor] NV_SYSTEM_DN: <data>

Determine why the 3GPP REBUILT event is being sent, and discuss the behaviour with the Network Administrator responsible for the equipment being managed by the 3GPP server.

As a workaround you can discard events based on the events reported time, at the 3GPP server [see attached example]. In this example rules file, the events @EventTime value, which must be calculated by your rules file, is stored in an array, to allow events to be discarded if they are replayed.

The $process_event_flag token can be used to turn on or off this discard feature.
You can use the clear[eventTime_lookup] function to clear the array using a specific event, such as a ProbeWatch event.
