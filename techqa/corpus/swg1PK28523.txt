APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using script to populate a datetime field with a long date
   
   ClearQuest does not recognize the value as a datetime value.
   
   
   
   Line of code is: SetFieldValue "datefld1",
   FormatDateTime(Date,VBLongDate)
   
   
   
   If This is changed to VBShortDate it works fine.
   
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   
   
   1. Create a field of datetime type.
   
   2. Place a text box on a form.
   
   3. Uncheck date and time on the Date/Time tab.
   
   4. Add the code from above to an action such as submit.
   
   5. Make sure to update the field name in the code.
   
   
   
   Now test and you will see the date on the form as Wednesday, 19
   July
   2006.
   
   
   
   The field will turn red as it does not recognize this as a valid
   date.
   If you remove the Wednesday it will work fine.
   
   
   
   The Windows Regional settings match this format.
   Tested this in ClearQuest 7.0 and it occurs there as well.
