CVEID: CVE-2017-6458 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6458]
DESCRIPTION: NTP is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by multiple buffer overflows in the ctl_put() functions. By sending an overly long string argument, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overflow a buffer and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 4.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/123616 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/123616] for the current score

For all other VRMF IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release of the product. 

Note: Installation of the fixes provided in the technote will install a cumulative fix package that will update the version of the FSM. Reference the technote for more details. 

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix may disable older encrypted protocols by default. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled weak encryption and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
