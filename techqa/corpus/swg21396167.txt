Title: IBM sitepreference renewed automatically - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the workplace, site preference cannot be saved properly even after applying/saving the change 

SYMPTOM
this problem can be first observed by noticing that portlets suddently disappeared


CAUSE
It is very likely that the problem was caused by loading of incorrect 

Site preferences file whenever the AEs cannot load preferences document,
the user who logs into Workplace at the time may get incorrect Site 
Preferences file. 
Anyway, it's the connection somewhere between AE and CE that is having 
the problem. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
workaround the issue by modifying the default site preferences file 


Steps to modify default SitePreferences.xml file:

1. On the AE box, determine which object store contains the SitePreferences.xml file user wants to use by looking in 
C:\Program Files\FileNet\Workplace\WEB-INF\bootstrap.properties. 
Look at line objectStoreId=FSObjectStore to determine the object store. 

2. On the CE box, use FileNet Enterprise Manager. 
Expand "Object Stores> [Object Store Name from step 1] > Root Folder > Preferences". 
Right click on "Site Preferences for Workplace". Select "View Document". 
It's okay to use notepad to view the document. 

3. On the AE box, make a back up of "C:\Program Files\FileNet\Workplace\WEB-INF\xml\SitePreferences.xml". 
4. Replace the contents in "C:\Program Files\FileNet\Workplace\WEB-INF\xml\SitePreferences.xml" with the contents from step 2. 
5. Add <?xml version="1.0"?> to the top of "C:\Program Files\FileNet\Workplace\WEB-INF\xml\SitePreferences.xml". 
At this point, AE synchronized its sitepreferece file with CE,
and won't have this kind of problem(portlet disappear).
Do keep in mind to backup the original sitepreferece file defaulted in AE.
(by changing name,or move to other folder)
