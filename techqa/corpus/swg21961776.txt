 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Administrator launches 'Controller Configuration' and selects a database connection. Administrator clicks the green 'play' button to launch Database Conversion.

Administrator tries to connect to a database - an error appears. 

SYMPTOM
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "SSLv3 SSLContext not available"


CAUSE
Administrator has put an old/incorrect JDBC (JAR) file version (or not placed it in the correct folders) on the Controller application server.

ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft SQL server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy the correct (recent/modern/updated) JAR file version into the relevant folders on the Controller application server.




 

Steps: 

1. Download the latest version of the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver. 

 

At the time of writing this article (July 2015): 

 * the current latest version is 4.1 
 * It can be downloaded from the link below


2. Double-click on the relevant file (e.g. "sqljdbc_4.0.2206.100_enu.exe") to extract the sub-files. 
3. Copy the file 'sqljdbc4.jar' into the 'Integration', ‘Lib’ and ‘ccr_64’ folders.


TIP: By default, the folders are located here: 

 * C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64\server\Integration 
 * C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64\server\FAP\lib 
 * C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64
