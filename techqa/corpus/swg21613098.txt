PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When changing user or group roles on one node in an TIP HA (High Availability) cluster, the role change does not get propagated to the other nodes in the HA cluster. 

SYMPTOM
The error "CWLAA6003: Could not display the portlet at this time, the portlet's module may be being updated." may appear in the role management pages when trying to edit roles.

Role changes on one node do not propagate to other nodes in the HA cluster.


CAUSE
The security configuration is not identical in all nodes in the HA cluster.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Compare the <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/wim/config/wimconfig.xml files in each node for differences. All configuration information in the federated repository must be the same for all HA nodes.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy the wimconfig.xml file from one node to all other nodes, and then restart all nodes.
