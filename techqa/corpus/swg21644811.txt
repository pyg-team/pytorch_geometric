QUESTION
 How to disable Edit Mode in the site toolbar for Portal 8.0? 

CAUSE
Portal 8.0 introduces support for managed pages, which are portal pages that are stored in Web Content Manager. By managing portal pages from within Web Content Manager, you can apply web content features like workflow, version control, and syndication to portal pages. This support provides a robust and integrated method for performing site management by ensuring that changes are coordinated and published together. 

A graphical toolbar integrates managed pages functions directly into your portal pages. The toolbar provides quick access to editing features, projects, and workflow actions that apply to the page. However, Portal administrators may want to hide this functionality from end users to prevent unintended changes to the page.

This technote applies to Portal 8.0. For Portal 8.5, refer to technote 1976870 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21976870].


ANSWER
If managed pages is enabled, set theme.disable.edit.mode parameter with a value of true on any label or page where you want to disable Edit Mode. This can be applied to labels or pages near the top of the hierarchy for the child pages to pick up the setting. 


1. Log into the Portal admin console
2. Navigate to the label or page using the Managed Pages portlet
3. Click Edit Page Properties
4. Select Advanced options > I want to set parameters
5. Add theme.disable.edit.mode parameter with a value of true
6. Click Ok. And then click Ok again.

NOTE: theme.disable.edit.mode=true may not work correctly in Portal 8.0 if managed pages are disabled. Apply cumulative fix 14 or later to obtain APAR PI14092 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI14092] to allow this combination of settings to function together correctly.

If managed pages is disabled, follow these steps to disable the Site toolbar:
1. Log into the WAS admin console (Dmgr, if clustered)
2. Navigate to Resource environment providers > WP VirtualPortalConfigService > Custom properties
3. Change the following properties to false:

global.toolbar.enabled
default.toolbar.enabled

4. Apply and Save the changes. (Sync the nodes, if clustered)
5. Restart Portal

NOTE: A CF upgrade may reset global.toolbar.enabled to true. The issue has been corrected in APAR PI38543 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI38543] included in cumulative fix 17 or later.
