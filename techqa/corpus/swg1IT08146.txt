APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During db2haicu setup using XML file the following error might
   occur:
   
   db2haicu is collecting information on your current setup. This
   step may take some time as db2haicu will need to activate all
   databases for the instance to discover all paths ...
   Creating domain 'domain' in the cluster ...
   Creating domain 'domain' in the cluster was successful.
   Configuring quorum device for domain 'domain' ...
   Configuring quorum device for domain 'domain' was successful.
   ...
   Adding DB2 database partition '0' to the cluster ...
   There was an error with one of the issued cluster manager
   commands. The user can determine the cause of the error by
   invoking 'db2instance -list' and 'db2cluster -list -alert'. The
   db2diag.log for the current member and the DB2 Information
   Center may provide additional details.
   There was an internal db2cluster error. Refer to the diagnostic
   logs (db2diag.log or /tmp/ibm.db2.cluster.*) and the DB2
   Information Center for details.

   DATA #1 : String, 7 bytes
   hostnam
   
   The reason it's failing is due to the hostname being truncated
   when using the XML input file. As seen in data field #1 from the
   above db2diag.log entry, the hostname value is appearing as
   "hostnam" instead of "hostname1".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run db2haicu in interactive mode.
