APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An issue where JazzSM 1.1.3 no longer allows a federated
   application
   (like PI) to open more than one tab within DASH. This means that
   you
   cannot launch a PI chart from AnomalySearch in JazzSM 1.1.3.
   
   And it means that you cannot open multiple PI charts from the
   Event
   Viewer / AEL / Detected Anomalies page (each new PI chart will
   overwrite the previous one).
