ABSTRACT
 IBM Rational Agent Controller, Version 8.3.1 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM Rational Agent Controller is a daemon process that enables client applications to launch host processes and interact with agents that coexist within host processes. 


Rational Agent Controller, Version 8.3.1 can be used to profile applications running in: 

 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.0 beta or other Java 1.6 applications. 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V7.0 (including service releases), or other Java 1.6 applications. 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 (including service releases), or other Java 1.5 applications. 
 *  IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.0 (including service releases), or other Java 1.4 applications.


Note: Profiling applications running on WebSphere Application Server, V6.0 (or other Java 1.4 applications) is only supported for Windows and Linux operating systems. For profiling on WebSphere Application Server version 6.0 (or other Java 1.4 applications) with other supported operating systems, use Rational Agent Controller version 7.x [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013420]. 

You do not need to install Rational Agent Controller if the WebSphere Application Server is installed on the same computer as your development product. However, to remotely profile your applications, you must install Rational Agent Controller on the same computer as the WebSphere Application Server where you published your applications. 
For details on other available versions of Agent Controller, see http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013420 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013420].
