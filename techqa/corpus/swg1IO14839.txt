Title: IBM IO14839: ACEGIPC.INI BACKLOG THRESHOLD - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I'd like to modify the default backlog threshold of 5000
   messages to a smaller number, so we can monitor the backlog more
   proactively.
   
   I'm having difficulty either getting it to work or successfully
   creating a scenario where I'll get an X377 GIPC HAS BACKLOG
   message; I'm not sure which.
   
   I've created the file /adx_ipgm/acegipc.us7 (attached).  I
   haven't been able to find any documentation that indicates
   exactly what I need to do (if anything) for the change to become
   active.
   
   In an attempt to test whether the backlog message will be
   generated, I've tried disconnecting CC (we have controller
   terminals) from the network and performing a number of
   transactions on DD.  The GIPC background task on DD showed a
   backlog over 100 records, but an X377 message was never
   generated.  Assuming the attached overlay file is correct, how
   can I most efficiently test the updated functionality?
   
   Attaching options as well.
