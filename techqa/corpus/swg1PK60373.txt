   *                      Augmenting the Network Deployment       *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When you specify the -profilePath argument during profile
   augmentation, the profile augmentation fails with a
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.
   
   There is a profilePathNotFound flag that is erroneously set
   when the -profilePath argument is used, which causes one of
   the ant tasks to not run one of the python scripts that should
   have created a log file.  Then the ant task attempts to set
   the wsadmin.output to the contents of the missing log file,
   which results in the java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ant task was updated to no longer set the
   profilePathNotFound flag, and subsequently no longer check
   for that flag when determining whether to run the python
   script that results in creating the log file.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 6.1.0.17 for the Feature Pack for web services.
