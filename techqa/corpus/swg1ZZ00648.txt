APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempting to install ICO, the preinstall checklist fails ERROR
   -  Checking that the following services are available:
   'cinder','glance', 'nova', 'neutron|nova network'

    fe971972966e4beb96b8e6ad7a6e2904  Image Service  image
   The typical 'glance' service has the name "Image Service" which
   causes the problem. The script is looking for "glance" but this
   bring your own openstack uses "Image Service".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The verification can be easily adapted for the service name
   given by the user by changing the image
   service name from "glance" to "Image Service"
   in the file ../installer/validatoropenstackServices.py and re
   run the prereq-checker/ico_install.sh script
   (services = ['cinder', 'glance', 'nova', 'neutron|nova
   network'])
   to
   (services = ['cinder', 'Image Service', 'nova', 'neutron|nova
   network'])
   We already have note in documentation to follow standard
   naming
   conventions.

   Note - Use standard naming convention whenever you configure
   OpenStack services. For more information about the standard
   naming convention, see

   To make the documentation more clear we will improve the note
   with context, if precheck fails what needs to be done..and/or
   what needs to be done to avoid it. A troubleshooting guide can
   be added for the issue.
