Title: IBM AIX agent commands hanging - United States

Text:
AIX; hangs TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running agent command like tlmagent -p or tlmagent -hw keeps running for more than 24 hours. 

SYMPTOM
Looking at the logs, we found:
trace_level MAX 
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/wscancfg 
because of the following errors: 
0509-150 Dependent module libcitcfg.a could not be loaded. 
0509-022 Cannot load module libcitcfg.a. 
0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name 
does not exist.


CAUSE
Missing module information may be caused by incorrect LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In AIX operating systems, set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the CIT binaries directory. The following example shows a command from a sh shell: 

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/tivoli/cit/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
After setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, please run wscanhw manually and verify if it 
works: /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/wscanhw
