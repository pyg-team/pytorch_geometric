ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is a cumulative fix release and addresses APARs and internally found issues since the release of OMNIbus 8.1 fix pack 3. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following defect solutions are included in this release: 

IV69160
When a LOOKUP table is empty, the cache file has an incorrect
checksum because of a syntax error. This problem has been
resolved.


IV75714
If the ProbewatchHeartbeatInterval property is set to a non-zero
value, and a probe fails to read its rules file, the probe will
deadlock while trying to shutdown if CacheRules is set to 0. If
CacheRules is set to 1, the probe will deadlock while trying to
read the cached rules file. These deadlocks have been resolved.


IV77594
The probe rules might not retrieve time fields correctly for
probes running in 64-bit mode. This problem has been fixed.


IV77881
Probes could fail to shutdown cleanly when not in peer-to-peer
failover mode. This has been resolved.


IV78263
The maximum size of the trigger action code block has been
updated to 32 KB from 8 KB. The new maximum size is applied
automatically when upgrading to the latest fix pack.
The fix implemented in APAR IV73963 has been reversed and you can
use the full 32 KB available in the SQL procedure's body
statement.


IV78277
Faster response time to HTTP POST requests made to the
ObjectServer HTTP/OSLC Interface by HTTP clients. This is due to
reduced contention between the threads in the request thread
pool.


IV78667
The GSKit version has been upgraded to 8.0.50.55 on OMNIbus
7.3.1, 7.4.0, and 8.1.0 to include a fix for a potential security
problem.


IV78761
This enhancement automates 3 housekeeping tasks. The first
automatically sets ExpireTime for events where it is not set.
The second monitors row counts and takes action if thresholds are
exceeded. The third de-escalates the Severity of events as they
age so that they eventually are removed from the system. All
three store relevant thresholds in the master.properties table so
that users can modify the behavior of the automated tasks without
having to modify any trigger code. The trigger group to which
these triggers belong to is initially disabled, as are the
triggers themselves. This is a safeguard against unintentional
execution of the triggers in a live environment. These triggers
should only be enabled in a live environment after full load and
functional testing have been carried out in a representative
development or test environment.


IV79182
This enhancement modifies the SCALA triggers which are used to
send events to the Message Bus Gateway via AEN and affect users
of IBM Smart Cloud Log Analysis (LA) with the OMNIbusInsightPack
version 1.3.0.2 only.

Changes need to be applied to the ObjectServer that the Message
Bus Gateway connects to when it is configured to send event data
to LA.

If the ObjectServer instance was created prior to fix pack 5
being applied, you must run the following SQL file to upgrade the
SCALA AEN triggers. If you don't do this, updates will not be
forwarded LA:

$OMNIHOME/etc/update81to81fp5.sql

The systems administrator should review the contents of this file
before it is applied

If you are using the SCALA ITNM triggers in the
$OMNIBUS/extensions/scala directory, you must apply the
'scala_itnm_configuration.sql' file which ships with ObjectServer
fixpack 5. Errors due to duplicate entries can be ignored when
applying these triggers.

PREREQUISITES
This fix pack installs on the GA release or any fix pack of Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 8.1.0.

2. Under the Preferences option, select Repositories and make
sure the "Search service repositories during installation
and updates" is checked.
3. Start the update and select the "IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus"
entry from the list of packages to find updates for.

Local Repository
----------------
If you are using a repository which is not on the Passport Advantage
site, you must specify the repository in the preferences before you
update.
1. Start Installation Manager.
2. Under the Preferences option, select Repositories and add a
new repository. Giving the location of your repository.
3. Start the update and select the "IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus"
entry from the list of packages to find updates for.

Electronic Software Delivery(ESD) Zip File
----------------------------------------------
If you have downloaded the ESD for Fix Pack 5 then:
1. Create a directory to store the files and extract the contents
on the zip file into this.
2. If you have installed Installation Manager using either
Administrator or Nonadministrator mode, run the update_gui
script to launch Installation Manager into the update panel
without the requirement of configuring the update repository.
3. If the script fails, or Installation Manager is installed in
Group mode, or you want to run in console mode, then you must
