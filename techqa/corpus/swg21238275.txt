QUESTION
 You want to find all New Function (NF) APARs for a specific release of CICS Transaction Server, CICSPlex SM, CICS Explorer, or the CICS Tools. 

ANSWER
See the CICS continuous delivery features [http://www.ibm.biz/continuous-delivery-features] in the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) documentation for new functions and capabilities that have been added to CICS TS and CICSPlex SM by service.

According to the Software maintenance strategy for CICS TS and its embedded components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530], IBM recommends that you upgrade to the latest release of CICS Explorer to obtain the most recent functionality and service. Old releases of CICS Explorer are not generally updated with new function, but new CICS Explorer releases are compatible with all earlier versions of CICS TS... For further details see Latest version of CICS Explorer and CICS Tools plug-ins. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404312]"
