APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Queue Status monitoring does not survive a restart of the
   SelfMonitoring Service.
   
   
   Replication:
   
   Using a suitable ObjectServer DataSource enable Memory, Queue,
   Cluster & DataSource Status monitoring in the SelfMonitoring
   Service.
   
   Run the Service, observe the appropriate events populate the
   ObjectServer.
   
   Stop the Service & restart the Service and observe the
   appropriate events populate/update the ObjectServer as before -
   except for the Queue Status monitoring.
   
   The Queue Status monitoring ceases to populate/update the
   events in ObjectServer after a restart of the SelfMonitoring
   Service.
   
   
   Workaround:
   
   Restart of the ImpactServer re-enables the Queue Status
   monitoring of the SelfMonitoring Service.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart of the ImpactServer re-enables the Queue Status
   monitoring of the SelfMonitoring Service.

   Replication Steps:
   
   1. Start EventReader. 2. Start Self Monitoring with Queue
   Monitoring enabled 3. EventReader should show the events for
   Queue Monitoring 4. Self Monitoring should show events for
   Queue Monitoring. Check the Self Monitoring logs or directly in
   the Object Server for Information events 5. Stop the
   EventReader and restart it. 6. Self Monitor service doesn't
   show the Queue Monitoring information for the EventReader.
