Title: IBM Daeja Viewer JavaScript API support in IBM Content Navigator - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I customize IBM Content Navigator using the Daeja JavaScript API for IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional or IBM Daeja ViewONE Virtual? 

CAUSE
The IBM Daeja viewers come with a JavaScript API available that allows for dynamic JavaScript-based custom functionality to be applied to the Daeja viewer. 

ANSWER
Use of the Daeja Viewer Java Script API in the current "Out Of The Box" version of Content Navigator is not supported. 

However, in the event of there being a critical requirement for such a level of customisation, the IBM Services team can be engaged to assist with providing a solution.
