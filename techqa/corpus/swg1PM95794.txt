ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Based on existing Jazz defect WI

   r#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=93727 [https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/Rational%20Quality%20Manager#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=93727]
   
   
   When a Test Suite Execution Console contains many Test Cases,
   the RQM User Interface (UI) can behave erratically. This is seen
   when the Test Suite Execution Console display is set up to show
   more Test Cases than will fit in the user?s browser window.
   
   This is one way to reproduce:
   1. Create many testcases (500) and associate them to a test
   suite
   2. Execute the test suite in paralel
   3. In the Test Suite Execution Console you'll have a Table
   showing the test cases. Set it to 75 items per page.
   4. You will have pages 1 - 7. And page 1 will be shown. Click on
   any other page (e.g. page 2).
   5. Every 10 seconds the view will be refreshed. Click on any
   other page (e.g page 5) before a refresh is complete.
     The easiest way to know if a refresh is not complete yet is by
   using FireBug's Net tab.
      You will see a new GET pagedSearchResult request, followed by
   2 other requests (GET executionResultGroupStatusDTO, POST
   _compactRendering).
      Wait until you see a pagedSearchResult kicks off and before
   it finishes click on the other page
   
   Expected
     View shows page 5
   
   Actual
     View shows page 1.
   Sometimes it jumps between page 1 and latest page (Page 2)
