APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  NetView took an ABENDU29A in DSIPSSND, PTF level UA66231, at
   offset x'320'. The U29A occurs when NetView attempts to send
   out data but the previous send is still in progress. This
   happened because of a loss of session with the terminal that
   resulted in the LOSTERM exit being driven.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If the session between a terminal       *

   *                      station task (OST) is lost during       *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When session loss occurs while an OST is in transition between
   the NetView logon panel (after logon credentials have been
   entered and verified) and the command facility (NCCF) screen,
   the presentation services code handling the transition
   encounters a failure to send data on the (now terminated)
   session but is left in a state that appears as though not
   all data has been sent and another send should be done.  When
   the next send is requested, the code determines that a prior
   send is still in progress and takes the x'29A' user abend.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Because, first and foremost, session loss (LOSTERM) processing
   sets the OST up for termination, presentation services send
   processing (part DSIPSSND) is being changed to detect task
   termination and fail a send request before the progress of
   any prior send is even examined, thus preventing the abend.
