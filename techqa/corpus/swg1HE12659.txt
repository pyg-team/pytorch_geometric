APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When spaces exist in the CLASSPATH, the data_feed_filters.xml
   file cannot be found by the Atlas Extensions program.  This
   prevents the Atlas Extensions from processing matters through
   into Atlas.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer is currently creating matters manually through Atlas
   and will update the MATTERSOURCEID from PA-LCC to DSMATTER.
   This is not a sustainable work around, and should be short term
   only.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ATLAS EXTENSIONS DOES NOT HANDLE SPACES IN THE CLASSPATH
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available now on Fix Central, as part of Atlas 6.0.3
   Fix pack 5
