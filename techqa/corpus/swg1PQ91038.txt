APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Getting message, "org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL: Unable to read
   value from underlying bridge," when testing using the WSAS 5.0.2
   plugable client on Sun JRE 1.4.1 or 1.3.1 with an EJB
   application
   running in WSAS.
   Environment: WebSphere Application Server (WSAS) 4.0.6, AIX
   4.3.3
   WSAS Pluggable Client 5.0.2, Sun JDK 1.4.1_03-b02, Sun JDK
   1.3.1_08-b03
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Proprietary marshaling introduced in 56396 is not interoperable
   with older IBM ORBs
   (nor is it interoperable with non-IBM ORBs).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ORB now detects if it is talking to an older (or non-IBM) ORB
   and falls back to
   standard marshaling format.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20040428 or later
