ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
   PM Forecast calculation for mileage based PMs report incorrectly
   when new values are entered in ACM assets.
   
   Maximo devides the Units to Go by the average value
   to calculate next due date. This is OK. But the problem
   is that maximo uses the same calculated value
   to forecast all maintenance intervalls.
   Instead the meter freqeuency devided  by average
   should be used
   Consequently, forecasted dates for the complete
   planning period change every time when new mileage
   is reported.
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE
   1. Go to "CM Item Master(CM)" application
   2. Create a new CM Item
    CM Item: CM01
    Description: CM Item 01
   3. Save
   4. Go to "Model(CM)" application
   5. Create a new Model
    Model: M01
    Description: Model 01
    Label System: ATA
    On "Labels for M01":
     Label system: ATA
   6. Click New Row at "Build Items for M01"
    Build Item: B1
    On "Labels for M01":
     Label: 000000
    On "CM Item for M01":
     CM Item: CM01
   7. Save
   8. Go to "Configurations" tab
    On "Configurations":
    8.1 Uncheck the "Abstract" flag
    8.2. Change Status to Active
   9. Go to "Build Hierarchy and Position Rules" tab, "Hierarchy
   Tree" subtab
    On "Build Hierarchy":
    9.1. Rigth click on Build Item M01
    9.2. Select "New Child"
     Build Item: B1
    9.3. Click OK
   10. Go to "New Asset Assemblies(CM)"
   11. Create a new Asset
    New Asset: NAA01
    CM Item: M01
    Model: M01
    Asset Status: OPERATING
    Registration: 123
    Asset Prefix: A
    Asset Suffix: 01
    Serial Prefix: AS
    Serial Suffix: 01
   12. Click New Row On "Meters" subtab
    Meter: ODOM-KM
    Force Copy to Sub Assemblies?: True
    Average Calculation Method: STATIC
    Average Units/Day: 1000
   13. Save
   14. Select Action > Create Sub Assemblies from CM Build
   15. Change status to Active
   16. Select Action > Create Asset
   17. Go to "Preventive Maintenance(CM)" application
   18. Create a new PM
    PM: PM01
    Description: Preventive Maintenance 01
    Asset: A01
   19. Go to "Frequency" tab
   20. Click New Row on "Meter Based Frequency" subtab
    Meter: ODOM-KM
    Frquency: 10000
    Alert Interval: 8000
    Warning Interval: 9000
   21. Change status to Active
   22. Select Action > Generate Forecast
    Forecast For (Days): 60
   23. Go to "Forecast" tab
   24. You can see that the first forecast date is 10 days from now
   and the difference between the forecast dates is every 10 days.
   This is because the forecast has used the static average of 1000
   km per day and the PM frequency of 10000 KM to estimate the
   dates at which it will fall due. This is correct.
   25. Select Action > Delete Forecast
   26. Go to "Assets(CM)" application
   27. Find A01 and go to "View" tab
   28. Click New Row on "Direct" subtab
    Meter: ODOM-KM
    Count Date: current system date and time
    Delta Count: 6000
   29. Go to "Preventive Maintenance(CM)" application and find PM01
   30. Go to "Frequency" tab
   31. Notice on "Meter Based Frequency" subtab, that the "Units to
   Go" field has been updated to 4000 (6000km has been entered
   against the Asset and the frequency is every 10000km; 10000 -
   6000 = 4000)
   32. Select action > Generate Forecast
    Forecast For (Days): 60
   33. Go to "Forecast" tab
    Only the first forecast date should be 4 days after the current
   system date as 4000 KM / 1000 KM per day = 4 days from now.
    All of the other forecast dates should have a difference of 10
   days between the prior date as the frequency is every 10000 KM
   with an average of 1000 per day = 10 days.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT
   Maximo uses the calculated days to go till
   next maintenance even for the calculation of all
   maintenance events, instead only for the first one.
   The forecasted dates depend on the Value of Units
   To Go. This means that every day the forecast will
   deliver different result.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   EXPECTED RESULT
   On the following example we see that as every day the
   Units go Go Value changes the forecasted dates also
   change when forecast is generated again (WRONG),
   Forecast from 07.07.16 has 26 days between maintenance
   intervalls and on  the forecast from
   08.07.2016 has 25 days between the intervalls
