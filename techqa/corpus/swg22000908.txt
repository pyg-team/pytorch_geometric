PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Datasource creation for Guardium Vulnerability Assessment on Oracle 12c Multitenant - Pluggable and Container database. 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM security 
Oracle 12c Multitenant 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

-You have to create a datasource for the CDB which is the container database that has the SID. 
-You would need to create a datasources for each PDB that reside in the CDB.
-Each PDB is actually a database and we treat each PDB just like any normal database. 
-You need to run a separate script on CDB and PDB to perform VA test.

"gdmmonitor-ora-container.sql" script should be used to create privileges needed for the CDB.

"gdmmonitor-ora.sql" script should be used to create privileges needed for PDB.
