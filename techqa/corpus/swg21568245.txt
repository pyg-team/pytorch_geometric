PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use this document to quickly find the appropriate items for issues in Tivoli Integrated Portal. A separate collection guide is provide for each of the following areas: General Issues, Installation, Performance, and Security 

CAUSE
For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs), particularly if the data is gathered before opening the PMR with IBM® Support.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if: 




 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity. 
 * Locating root cause can speed up a development code fix.

Gathering general information Providing the following general items is useful to IBM Support for any issue reported in Tivoli Integrated Portal: 

Environment Data: 
Update the PMR with the output of the following: 

1) A clear, specific problem description, including specific usage information and error scenario on how to recreate the problem you encountered. 

2) Output of “ java –version” command. 

3) The installed product listing from the Deployment Engine listIU command. Save the output to a file and include the file when opening or updating the PMR: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21568245&amp;aid=6] 
Collect the output of the following commands: 
C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\de_version.cmd 
C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\listIU.cmd 
C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\de_lsrootiu.cmd 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21568245&amp;aid=7] 
For root install :
Collect the output of the following commands: 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_version 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/listIU.sh 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_lsrootiu.sh 

Non-root install : 
Collect the output of the following commands: 
<Install User's HOME>/.acsi_<install_username>/bin/de_version 
<Install User's HOME>/.acsi_<install_username>/bin/listIU.sh 
<Install User's HOME>/.acsi_<install_username>/bin/de_lsrootiu.sh 

Where <Install User's HOME> is the home directory for the OS user used to install TIP, and <install_username> is the OS user ID used to install TIP.
