Title: IBM C&DS fails to install to DB2 Express-C - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I decided to try to use DB2 Express-C (free) edition for the C&DS install on my IBM laptop. It nearly installed fine but failed at the creation of the reporting views.

I'm aware that Express-C is not a supported platform - but MS SQL Server Express works so I thought I'd give it a try.

The error was:

Nov 08 2009 18:14:16 INFO : PEV Reporting View Installer: start step: Create PEV reporting views post install
Nov 08 2009 18:14:16 ERROR: No match for database product name: 'null' in any of the following Regular Expressions:
MySQL
.*DB2/.*
DB2 UDB for AS/400
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server

It looks like Express-C isn't correctly returning a database product name. I suspect that if this minor issue could be fixed then it would probably install fine. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A request to support the Express-C database has been submitted to C&DS Development.
