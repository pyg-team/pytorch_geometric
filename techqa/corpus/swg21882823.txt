QUESTION

According to the documentation at JDBC driver requirements (all databases) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JSW_5.2.0/com.ibm.help.sys_rqmts.doc/SysRqmts_JDBCRqmts.html]: 

 *

 *  and search for the SQL Server JDBC driver 3.0 or 4.0 (if you are using the Lightweight JDBC Adapter).

Customer noticed outside SBI installation problems during performance tests with MSSQL JDBC Driver 3.0. 
So the question is, does SBI 5.2.5 support using MSSQL JDBC Driver 4.0 or 4.1 for mssqlPool connection to MSSQL Server 2012? 
ANSWER
IBM Sterling Software Engineering team confirmed that all of SBI tests have been running JDBC 4.0 and as such support it.
Documentation will be updated to reflect this.
4.1 testing has not been done and would need to be a future item.
