APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Attempts to create LowerLimit and UpperLimit element
   types forces it to be derived from AttributeValueVariationPoint
   in AUTOSAR_40 profile of IBM Rational Rhapsody
   
   Error Description:
   
   Although the Upper/LowerLimit is derived from
   AttributeValueVariationPoint it is not necessarily related to a
   SystemConstantValueSet. Unfortunately Rhapsody forces me to
   create one, otherwise I wouldn't be able to create the limits or
   even see them for imported ARXML files. The CompuMethod is often
   used to define enumerations (find attached the CompuMethods
   defined by the Autosar standard), i.e. if you have a big model
   with lots of enumerations this list will be very crowded and due
   to the fact that CompuScales don't have a short name, this list
   gets unclear very fast.
   
   The Upper/LowerLimit is part of a CompuScale and from my point
   of view they should be visible directly below the corresponding
   CompuScale in the ModelBrowser.
   
   
   Workaround: None
