PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have installed CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) and you discovered you have two LPA datasets, DWW.SDWWLPA and hlq.SDWWDLPA. You want to know which dataset is required. 

CAUSE
The CICS VR installation has created dataset DWW.SDWWLPA and is required for the CICS VR address space.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You compare LPA datasets SDWWDLPA and SDWWLPA and find: 


SDWWDLPA with these modules and sizes:
DWW1SCSR 00000458 
DWW1VS00 00000458 
And SDWWLPA with these modules and sizes: 
DWW1SCSR DWW1VS00 0001AA78
DWW1SINI DWW1VS00 0001AA78
DWW1VS00 0001AA78 

Since modules DWW1SCSR and DWW1VS00 are the same in both datasets, but different sizes, you want to know which you actually need, and which should be in the LPA.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you install the CICS VR product, you must ensure the CICS VR provided LPA library DWW.SDWWLPA is concatenated ahead of the DFSMS/MVS supplied LPA library hlq.SDWWDLPA. In your SYS1.PARMLIB member LPALSTxx, use the following concatenation: 

SYS1.LPALIB
DWW.SDWWLPA
hlq.SDWWDLPA
