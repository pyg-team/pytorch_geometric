PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Database populating BP data to Correlation Table at FULL persistence but BP persistence is set to 'Error Only' 

SYMPTOM


The Persistence level of a business process (in this case, X12 DeenvelopeUnified) is set to Error Only, but GIS inserts correlation information into the database at persistence FULL.

No Business Process data is available, but DOCUMENT information in the Correlation table is present.

Error Message No Errors Reported.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


The Persistence Level set for the BP was not intended to be related to the amount of data written to the Correlation table. Gentran Integration Suite / Sterling Integrator can persist all data or only a small amount of data for each activity processed. Persistence refers to the level of detail written to the database as the business process runs. Data written to the Correlation table is not regarded as persisted data. GIS / SI uses correlations to define specific data items as tracking points for business processes and documents. To find specific Invoice numbers, for example, one can define a correlation (by using an Update Standard Rule in a translation map, for example) that alllows the Invoice number to be searched in Business Processes > Advanced Search > Correlation. The data for the correlations is stored as name/value pair records in the Correlation table in Gentran Integration Suite.
