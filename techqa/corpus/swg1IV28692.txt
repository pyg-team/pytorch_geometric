APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Prior to APAR IV01664 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV01664]  a search on a field defined as EXACT was
   case insensitive
   e.g. a search of appr would find APPR
   
   This was viewed as not working to design so IV01644 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV01644] changed this
   to be case sensitive
   e.g.
   a serch of appr will not find APPR
   a serch of APPR will find APPR
   
   This APAR is opened to facilitate a swith (possibly a system
   parameter) that will allow the client to choose which way they
   prefer this to work.
   
   APAR open OK'd by Xinyu to introduce this feature.

   INTRODUCE SWITCH FOR EXACT SEARCH TYPE CASE SENSITIVE OR EXACT
   SEARCH TYPE CASE INSENSITIVE
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Introduce a system property mxe.caseInsensitiveExactSearch.
   Default value is 0.  When set to 0, exact search on aln fields
   are case sensitive.  When set to 1, exact search on aln fields
   are case insensitive.  This is to accommodate the customer's
   request to have pre- IV01644 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV01644] behavior.  Customer who wish to
   take advantage of this feature need to manually add this new
   system property.
   
   
   
   
   
   Tests need to be done on a field that's ALN and search type is
   EXACT.  If you don' have a field like that, use DB Config.
