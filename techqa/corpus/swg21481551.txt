Title: IBM SPSS 16: Error message 16212 when exporting graph to PowerPoint (Office 2003) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS 16 and have created output containing pivot tables and graphs. I would like to export this output to PowerPoint. However for every output file I receive the following error message when I click on File - Export: 
"Error 16212: Failed to collect script output".
Additionally I have noticed that I am unable to run any sample scripts. When I try to run for example ClearViewer.wwd I always receive a runtime error message. When I click on the green arrow icon in the script file I receive for example this error message:
"Runtimeerror '-2147010895 (800736b1)': Automation error. This application can not start because the configuration of the application is not correct. To solve the problem you should reinstall the application". 
What can I do to solve the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve this issue please go to the installtion folder of your SPSS installation and browse to the folder VC8. Within this folder you will find vcredist_x86.exe. Run this file and both error messages will disappear when you export to PowerPoint or run a sample *.wwd script
