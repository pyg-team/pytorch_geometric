APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A REFRESH CLUSTER(clusname) REPOS(NO) command was issued.
   Afterward, some other queue managers in the cluster were
   unreachable from the queue manager where the REFRESH was done.
   Applications received MQRC 2087 when attempting to send reply
   messages back to these queue managers.
   
   The issue occurs when a cluster sender channel is active at the
   time that the refresh is issued but then goes inactive before
   the full repository has republished that cluster-sender record
   in response to the refresh.
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   MQRC_UNKNOWN_REMOTE_Q_MGR CLUSSDR
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do another REFRESH CLUSTER command or simply alter the
   description of the CLUSRCVR channel on the target queue manager
   to cause the cluster subscription to be republished.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 8       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A Partial Repository Queue Manager may  *
   *                      incorrectly lose sight of other Qmgrs   *
   *                      in a cluster, after a REFRESH CLUSTER   *
   *                      REPOS(NO) command is issued.            *
   ****************************************************************
   If auto-defined cluster sender channels are running when a
   REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS(NO) command is issued, but the channel
   stops prior to the REFRESH command processing completes, the
   republish of cluster Qmgr records may not be correctly added to
   the local cluster cache by reconcile processing. As a result the
   Qmgr may lose sight of the remote cluster Qmgr until the
   internal subscription for the Qmgr expires or the remote Qmgr's
   cluster receive definition is altered.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Cluster refresh and reconcile processing has been corrected,
   to ensure the republished cluster Qmgr record is added to the
   cluster cache, when a running cluster channel stops prior to
   refresh processing completing.
