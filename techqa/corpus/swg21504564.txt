PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When your connection is to a CICSPlex SM V3.2 WUI server and you attempt to select administrative or definitional resources from the CICS Explorer, you receive CNX0624E Get Definition from "region" failed. If using CICS Explorer V1.1.x.x , you also receive CNX0595E with BADPARM. If your connection is to a CICSPlex SM V4.x WUI server, you receive CNX0225W resource_type unsupported in this context. 

SYMPTOM
If you are using CICS Explorer V1.0.0.x or V1.0.1.x, you receive an OK response followed by message CNX0624E when selecting a definitional resource from the Administrative menu. You have a single pre CICS TS V4.1 region selected in the CICSplex tab and the host connection is a CICSPlex SM Data connection to a CICSPlex SM V3.2 WUI server. 

CNX0599E: RESPONSE(OK)
CNX0624E: Get resource_type Definition from context failed

If you are using CICS Explorer V1.1.x.x, you receive a BADPARM response followed by message CNX0624E when selecting a definitional resource from the Administrative menu. You have a single pre CICS TS V4.1 region selected in the CICSplex tab and and the host connection is a CICSPlex SM Data connection to a CICSPlex SM V3.2 WUI server. 

CNX0595E: An unexpected failure occurred: BADPARM
CNX0624E: Get resource_type Definition from context failed

If you are using CICS Explorer V1.0.0.x, V1.0.1.x, or V1.1.x.x, you receive a CNX0225W message when selecting a definitional resource from the Administrative menu (or Definitions menu in v1.1.x.x.). This occurs when you have a single pre CICS TS 4.1 region selected in the CICSplex tab and the host connection is either a CICSPlex SM Data connection or CICS Management Interface connection to a CICSPlex SM V4.x WUI server. 

CNX0225W resource_type unsupported in this context.



CAUSE
The CICS Explorer specifies the CSDGROUP parameter on its GET request when a single CICS region is selected. The CSDGROUP parameter is only valid in CICS TS V4.2 regions or CICS TS V4.1 regions with APAR PK90112 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK90112] applied or higher. In this instance, the CICS Explorer was connected to a CICS TS V3.2 WUI server using a CICSPlex SM Data connection and the CICS Explorer had selected an individual CICS region in the CICSplex tab before selecting a resource from the Administrative menu. 



ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer V1.0.0.7 or higher; CICS TS V3.x WUI server using the CICSPlex SM Data connection.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In this case, a single CICS MAS is in focus in the CICSplex tab and results in the CSDGROUP parameter being added which is only valid for CICS TS V4.1 and above, not when using a CICSPlex Data connection. The .cicsexplorer.trace.0 contains entries similar to the following: 

com.ibm.cics.sm.comm.cpsm.CPSMConnection.get() [OBJECT=TRNCLDEF&CONTEXT=WJBCM320&SCOPE=WJBMS32C&P_CSDGROUP=*] com.ibm.cics.sm.comm.cpsm.CPSMConnection.get() [STATUS=BADPARM&CMASSYSID=M32A&CPSMREL=0320&SERVERAPPLID=WJBMS32A&TASKID=0008555]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If your connection is to CICSPlex SM V4.x WUI server, apply the PTFs for PK90112. 

IBM FITS marketing requirement MR0705115551 has been submitted to provide more meaningful warning messages in the CICS Explorer to clearly indicate that the CSD definitional resources are only supported in CICS TS V4.1 (with PK90112 applied) or later levels of CICS TS.
