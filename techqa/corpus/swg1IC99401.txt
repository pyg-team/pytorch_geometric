APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The HTTPRequest Node will not permit a response to contain
   duplicate Content-Length or Content-Type headers, even if these
   duplicate headers contain the same value.
   
   Instead the Broker throws a BIP3157 exception stating that "An
   error was found whilst parsing HTTP header data. Multiple
   occurances of a HTTP header were found, when only one is
   allowed, or a non-folding HTTP Header was folder. The header
   was ''.

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The HTTPRequest Node will not permit a response to contain
   duplicate Content-Length or Content-Type headers, even if these
   duplicate headers contain the same value.
   
   Instead the Broker throws a BIP3157 exception stating that "An

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The HTTPRequest Node now accepts duplicate Content-Length or
   Content-Type headers providing the values are identical.
