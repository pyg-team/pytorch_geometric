AIX71Cert; AIX61Cert TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to run the installation program for the bundled IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager product from within an AIX Version 6.1 or 7.1 WPAR, the UNIX temporary space check step might fail with an error message.The installation processing cannot proceed beyond that point because only the cancel option is present. 

SYMPTOM
The following message displays on the installation panel when you attempt a graphical mode install or exists in the product installation log if you are attempting a silent-mode installation:
BWMCR8311E Directory path fails minimum free disk space check. 


CAUSE
The installation program, which is used by the bundled IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager, does not properly handle the AIX WPAR file system. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Instead of installing the product from within the WPAR, install the product into the WPAR when you are logged into the global environment. Use a product installation path that is similar to the following path: /wpars/WPAR_NAME/opt/IBM/itcam 

WPAR_NAME represents the name of your WPAR.

Note: When you use the AIX Version 7.1 operating system, the system pre-installation check fails with an unsupported operating system message. This check fails because AIX 7.1 became available after the initial release of the WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0. You can ignore this message and proceed with the installation process because the product is supported on the AIX Version 7.1 operating system.
