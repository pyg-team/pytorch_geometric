ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XI50.3.8.1.6
   
   Problem Description:
   
   The "commit" functionality of the WebGUI, when using
   group-defined users, does not work to make and save changes.
   DP does NOT allow you to create WSP from Control Panel / WSP.
   The same is true for XMLFW service.
   This behavior can be reproduced on 3.8.1 and 3.8.0. The problem
   does not exist in 3.7.3.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected DataPower customers are those using the Web Service
   Proxy with limited permissions.
   
   The button to create a new local endpoint handler on the Web
   Service Proxy is disabled when correct permissions are set.
   
   This button is being incorrectly disabled.  The individual
   permissions for each type of local endpoint handler should
   control the options displayed when clicking the button.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix will be available in next major releases
