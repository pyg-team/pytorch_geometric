QUESTION
 How do I display additional properties on the Documents view in Case Manager Case Information widget? 

CAUSE
End-users want to see more information about the documents when working with them or adding new ones in a case. The default Name, Modified By and Modified On properties offer very limited information.

ANSWER
The document properties are displayed on the Documents tab in the Case Information widget. That tab displays in the Documents view. In the example below, the property Added By is configured to be displayed in addition to the properties that are displayed in the out-of-the-box Case Manager Client: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663719&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663719&aid=1]

Use the following steps to display additional properties on the Documents view in the Case Information widget:


 1. Logon to your IBM Content Navigator Administration desktop (http://<host>:<port>/navigator/?desktop=admin). 
 2. Go to the Repositories section. 
 3. Edit the repository that corresponds to the target object store. 
 4. Click on the Connect button to connect to the repository. 
 5. Go to the Browse tab. 
 6. Add any additional properties that you want to show up in your Documents tab here. ('Added By in the example above.) For example:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663719&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663719&aid=2]
    
 7. Click the Save and Close button to save and close the repository. 
 8. Log out of the IBM Content Navigator Administration desktop. 
 9. Logon to the IBM Case Manager client desktop and you can see the properties.
    


Please note that the additional properties will only show up in the Details view. The Magazine view is limited to only display the basic information in the Case Information widget despite the check box to show the property on the Magazine view on the screen shot above.
