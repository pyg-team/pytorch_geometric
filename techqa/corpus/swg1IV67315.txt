APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RFE13303 - Virtual Swap space calculation change for Solaris
   
   Attributes reporting the percentage of physical swap free space,
   if system is paging, the scanned pages, and the ratio of
   physical memory on swap are missing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Monitoring Agent for Unix OS is missing some key virtual
   memory metrics.
   
   The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS is unable to monitor the
   utilization of the swap spaces defined on disk. It is also
   missing some Solaris specific metrics to report the number of
   pages scanned by the page scanner and whether or not the system
   is paging.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ten new attributes added to the Unix Memory attribute group:
   
   1. Total Disk Swap Space (MB)
      The total number of megabytes of swap spaces defined on disk.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   2. Used Disk Swap Space (MB)
      The number of megabytes currently used in the swap spaces
      defined on disk.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   3. Available Disk Swap Space (MB)
      The number of megabytes currently available in the swap
      spaces defined on disk.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   4. Percent Disk Swap Space Used
      Percent of swap space used on disk.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available and -2 indicates
        Not Collected.
   
   5. Percent Disk Swap Space Available
      Percent of swap space available on disk.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available and -2 indicates
        Not Collected.
   
   6. Real Memory on Disk Swap Ratio
      Ratio between total real memory and total swap space on disk.
      [Calculated by the agent using the formula:
      (Total_Real_Mem_MB / Total_Disk_Swap_Space_MB )].
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available and -2 indicates
        Not Collected.
   
   7. Unlocked Pageable Memory (Solaris)
      The amount of unlocked pageable memory available for memory
      allocation expressed in megabytes.
      This information is only available on Solaris machines.
      [Corresponding to 'availrmem' in kstat -c pages output].
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   8. Scanned Pages (Solaris)
      Number of pages scanned by the page scanner at last wake-up.
      This information is only available on Solaris machines.
      [Corresponding to 'nscan' in kstat -c pages output].
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   9. System Paging (Solaris)
      The system starts paging when the free memory falls below the
      scanner threshold.
      This information is only available on Solaris machines.
      [Based on 'freemem' and 'lotsfree' in kstat -c pages output.
      Set to Paging when freemem is less than lotsfree]
      Note: the value 2 indicates Paging, 1 indicates Not Paging,
        0 indicates Unknown, -1 indicates Not Available, -2
        indicates Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates
        Value_Exceeds_Maximum, and -2147483648 indicates
        Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
   
   10.Page Size
      Rated number of bytes per virtual memory page.
      Note: the value -1 indicates Not Available, -2 indicates
        Not Collected, 2147483647 indicates Value_Exceeds_Maximum
        and -2147483648 indicates Value_Exceeds_Minimum.
