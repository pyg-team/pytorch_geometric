CONTENT
IBM has provided customers with a Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool where you can locate and find complete lists of supported operating systems, system requirements, prerequisites, and optional supported software for WebSphere Message Broker versions, including IBM Integration Bus 9.0. 

The SPCR tool links to information about the minimum product levels that must be installed before opening a problem report with IBM WebSphere Message Broker Technical Support. The software versions and any maintenance levels listed in the tool have been explicitly verified as working. 

Please refer to the WebSphere Message Broker Connectivity Pack for Healthcare README [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] for the latest information. 

Virtualization Environments 
Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. IBM will not undertake to troubleshoot issues which are caused solely as a result of running in a virtualized environment.

Please also refer to:
Server virtualization policy for IBM software [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/virtualization_policy.html]
