QUESTION
 How can I use Process Engine (PE) Server Debugging to troubleshoot FileNet P8 PE issues? 

ANSWER
PE Server Debugging is used to help troubleshoot issues involving the VWJs request handler processes. Server Debugging is a part of the P8 3.5 Process Task Manager application, and by default it is disabled (Off).

To enable Server Debugging: 

 1. Open the Process Task Manager on the PE server. 
 2. Highlight the PPM, click on the Advanced tab and set the Server Debugging to “On”.


This starts a trace log of the VWJs processes. The trace file, named vwtrace, is created in the /fnsw/local/tmp directory on UNIX servers, and in \fnsw_loc\tmp on Windows servers. 

To capture an issue or problem occurrence in the logging:  1. Enable Server Debugging (i.e., set to “On”) 
 2. Reproduce the problem if you can force it to occur. Otherwise, wait for it to happen if you cannot reproduce the problem at will. 
 3. Once the problem has been captured, immediately disable the Server Debugging (i.e., set to “Off”).


Data to collect:  * The vwtrace file. 
 * Also provide the elog (e.g., \fnsw_loc\logs\elogs\elog<yyyymmdd>). 
 * Include a description of any known circumstances leading up to the issue, along with any server error logs. 
 * Also document the time at which the issue occurred.
