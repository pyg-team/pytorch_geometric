NSS is a component that supports the development of security-enabled applications. NSPR provides platform independence for operating system facilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2013-1740 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1740]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the ssl_Do1stHandshake() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to return unencrypted, unauthenticated data from PR_Recv.

The attack does not require local network access, authentication, or specialized knowledge and techniques. An exploit would not affect the integrity of data or availability of the system, but it could impact the confidentiality of information.

Affected Versions: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90394 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90394] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1490 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1490]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, using the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.

The attack does not require local network access or authentication, but some specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit would affect the integrity of data, confidentiality of information and the availability of the system.

Affected Versions: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1491 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1491]

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in Mozilla Firefox,Thunderbird and SeaMonkey using the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library has an unknown impact and attack vector.

The attack does not require local network access or authentication, but some specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit would not affect the availability of the system or confidentiality of information, but it could impact the integrity of data.

Affected Versions: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1492 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1492]

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) related to the processing of wildcard characters embedded within the U-label of an internationalized domain name in a wildcard certificate has an unknown impact and remote attack vector.

The attack does not require local network access or authentication, but some specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit would not affect the availability of the system or confidentiality of information, but it could impact the integrity of data.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1544 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1544]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the PK11_ImportCert() function when adding NSSCertificate structures. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

The attack does not require local network access or authentication, but some specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit would affect the integrity of data, confidentiality of information and the availability of the system.

Affected Versions: NSS 3.x used in Firefox before 31.0, and Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7
