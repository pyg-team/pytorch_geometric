QUESTION
 How is MaximumCubeLoadThreads value and TM1 server startup Time related ? Also how can conditional feeders be effected by MaximumCubeLoadThreads value 

ANSWER
1. How will it impact the TM1 start up time if the value of the parameter MaximumCubeLoadThreads having anything greater then or equal to 2 changed to 0 or is removed? 

 
Ans) Yes, the start up time would definitely increase. By how much the start up time increase, is purely based on the size of the TM1 cube and the number of conditional feeder if any. When MaximumCubeLoadThreads is set to 0, cube loading and feeder processing is NOT multi-threaded. If incase the value is set to 2 then it makes use of 2 threads to start the TM1 server. After you set the value to 0, single thread would be used to start TM1 server and hence the delay in starting.


2. If you have conditional feeders what should be the ideal value for MaximumCubeLoadThreads parameter ? What are the effects if the value is not set to 0 with respect to conditional feeders?

Ans) Our Operations Guide states:
If your TM1Â® model uses conditional feeders where the condition clause contains a fed value, you should set MaximumCubeLoadThreads=0 or exclude the parameter from the Tm1s.cfg file to disable the use of multiple threads at load time.

Data can be feed incorrectly if a condition is based on a previous feeder. When MaximumCubeLoadThreads is enabled, TM1 cannot manage the order in which 
feeders are processed. For example Feeder A is suppose to execute before Feeder B for some logical reason. If multi-threading is enabled meaning MaximumCubeLoadThreads is set to 2 there is no gaurantee that Feeder B will not execute/complete execution before feeder A. Hence we recommend it to be set to 0 when conditional Feeders are used, because this ensures Feeder A completes first followed by Feeder B.

If your TM1 model uses conditional feeders where the condition clause contains a fed value, you should set MaximumCubeLoadThreads=0 or exclude the parameter from the Tm1s.cfg file to disable the use of multiple threads at load time.


3. Is there a way to reduce the startup time of TM1 server even if we have set MaximumCubeLoadThreads to 0 ?

Ans) To tune up the startup time, you may take look at the rules/feeders and be sure that they as simplified as possible to align with your business rules. Make sure they are not overfeeded as processing of feeders takes up much of the load time.

There is another simple way to shorten the restart time if you have any historical/archival cubes that you are loading but rarely use. The way to accomplish this would be to set the cubes to Load on Demand. This means they will not get fully loaded on restart, however they will be visible in Server Explorer, and should you need to use the cube you can just double-click on it and it will load at that time. This can be particularly helpful if the historical cubes contain large rules/feeders. Here is link for how to set it up:

You could do the same with large non-historical cubes that may not be needed immediately when the service comes up.
