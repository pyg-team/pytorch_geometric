 2. Locate the Start_RDAWebServer.bat and change the path to new Tomcat version.
    For Windows example: “C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\RDS_5.2.0.2\webAccessServer\apache-tomcat-6.0.45\bin”
    For Linux example : “/var/IBM/Rational?RDS_5.2.0.2/WebAccessServer/apache-tomcat-6.0.45” 
 3. Copy ./<old_tomcat>/webapps/*.war to ./<new tomcat>/webapps. 
 4. Copy the following files from <old_tomcat>/bin to <new tomcat>/bin:  * GroupSchema.xsd 
     * tdsbuild.property 
     * TDSConfiguration.xml 
     * TDSResource_en_US.xml 
     * UserSchema.xsd
    
    
 5. Copy the JRE path from <old_tomcat>/bin/catalina.bat to <new_tomcat>/bin/catalina.bat.
