Text:
ACUOSI0050E; BUILD FAILED; copyEAR.sh; tcr211_Embedded_FP2; failed to copy; permission denied; TCR; FP2; FixPack 2 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of TCR 2.1.1 FixPack 2 fails with the following error message:
ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Looking at the the file IBM_Tivoli_Common_Reporting_2.1_1_FP2.log you can find additional details about the failure.
In some cases it can show the procedure failing at this step:

Errors: [com.ibm.ac.si.ap.action.ExternalCommandActionException: 
ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1. 
Invocation string: 
[/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2Components/TCRComponent/conf/tcr211_Embedded_FP2/copyEAR.sh, /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2Components/TCRComponent, 
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2, TIPProfile], 
com.ibm.ac.common.hosts.UpdateFailedException: : ] 

so while executing the script copyEAR.sh. 

Looking at the TCRComponent/logs, you can find all the STDOUT and STDERR streams for the installation scripts, including the failing copyEAR.sh. 
So you can check into tcr211_Embedded_FP2_run_cognos_copy_ear_update.err to understand what caused the installation failure.
If you find a message like:
****

/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/IBM Cognos 8.ear/p2pd.war/tivoli/ITM/images/newWindow_16.gif
***

this indicates a lack of permission for the user account you used to run the installation, on the directory tree involved with this operation.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If it is expected you run the Fixpack installation with a non-root user, double check the permission bit for the involved directory tree and in case temporary set them to give write authorization to the user account you are installing the FixPack with. 

Then run again the installation program.
