ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I was trying to run a repro of a bug that involves TM1Web and
   some underlying Excel sheets.  I got the error message (after
   things ran a bit)??"Failed to open the target workbook as the
   file does not exist"??This messages tells me nothing even though
   I know that the code had the specifics available right when the
   error was posted.  I make a joke about how the worst error
   message in the world is "File not found" without every telling
   the user WHAT file was not found.  I thought the world was past
   that point, but apparent we are not.??(I am dead-in-the-water
   with the repro case because I have no idea what is being looked
   for.)???How about:?"Failed to open workbook "xxxxyyyy.xlsm"
   because file "\sdfsdf\dfgdfg\dfgdfg\asdasdas\xxxxyyyy.xlsm" was
   not found"??Note: workbook name with file type?         file
   name with full path?
