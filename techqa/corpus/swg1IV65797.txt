LOCAL FIX
 *  If default lookup/gateway stitchers are used
   
   Replace the stitcher
   $PRECISION_HOME/eventGateway/stitchers/LookupNbrFailure.stch
   with
   $PRECISION_HOME/eventGateway/stitchers/default/LookupNbrFailure.
   stch.pre
   
   This will use the fp3 stitcher instead of the fp4.
   Stop ITNM, and restart.
