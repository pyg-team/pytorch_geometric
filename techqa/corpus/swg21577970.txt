CAUSE
When an IBM SPSS compressed image is launched, files compressed within it are extracted to the temporary location assigned to the signed in user i.e. /Documents and settings/... or /users.

as MD5 to verify the file content or simply attempt downloading a second time and test.

- Available space within the temporary location noted by the installer.
- Ability to write in the temporary location noted by the installer.

Transfer the files again, resolved the issue.
