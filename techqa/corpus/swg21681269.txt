PROBLEM
Error "CRIMA1071E: The installation package 'IBM WebSphere Portal Extend'
requires components supplied by other packages." when attempting to upgrade WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.0 to CF12

SYMPTOM
IIM throws the following error:

CRIMA1071E: The installation package 'IBM WebSphere Portal Extend'
requires components supplied by other packages.


CAUSE
In this case the customer was attempting to apply CF12 and FP1 (Portal 8.0.0.1) to Portal 8.0.0.0 with IIM simultaneously. However, Portal 8.0.0.1 requires WAS 8.0.0.5. When Portal 8.0.0.0 is installed it is installed with WAS 8.0.0.3 and this customer had not upgraded the WAS environment. 

As a general recommendation, we recommend that before upgrading Portal to the latest maintenance that WAS is upgraded to the latest maintenance.


ENVIRONMENT
Linux
Portal 8.0.0.0
WAS 8.0.0.3



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade WAS to 8.0.0.5 and then re-attempt the CF12 upgrade
