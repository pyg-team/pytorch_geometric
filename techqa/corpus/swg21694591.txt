QUESTION
 When configuring the ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1 agent, when would you specify the startup script? 

ANSWER
Basically it depends on the startup method- 

If you start via the admin console while using a nodemanager, you do not 
specify a startup script for the managed instances during configuration. 

If you are starting the managed instances using the startManagedWeblogic.sh script, then you need to specify the startup script(startWeblogic.sh) during configuration. There will be a stanza in the startWeblogic script for each managed instance after the configuration.
