Title: IBM SEV parameter in SITINFO of situations is removed by KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y - United States

Text:
ITM; situation; severity; EIF; SITINFO; KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SEV parameter in SITINFO of exported situations disappeared after setting KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y on TEPS. Why is the parameter removed? 

SYMPTOM
After setting KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y on TEPS, 

- SEV parameter in SITINFO of exported situations disappeared 
- SEV parameter and EIF Severity are synchronized with what you set in TEP Situation editor. 

You cannot change each severity to different level as you like. For example,

case 1) 
1. set the following severity level in the situation editor.
State in Formula tab = Critical
EIF Severity in EIF tab = Fatal
2. "Apply" or "OK"
3. open this situation in the situation editor
4. The change of EIF Severity are not saved. Both of them are saved as Critical.
State in Formula tab = Critical
EIF Severity in EIF tab = Critical

case 2) 
1. set the following severity level in the situation editor.
State in Formula tab = Critical
EIF Severity in EIF tab = Fatal
2. "Apply" or "OK"
3. dissociate this situation
4. open this situation in the situation editor
5. EIF Severity are not saved. It shows "< Default EIF Severity>"


CAUSE
When KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y is set, severity of the situation is not determined
by SEV in SITINFO. Severity of EIF events is synchronized with what you set in
TEP Situation editor, so SEV parameter is no more stored in SITINFO.

Default mapping of situation events to OMNIbus events

Before setting KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y
<SITINFO>
<![CDATA[ATOM=UNIXPS.UCOMMAND;SEV=Critical;]]>
</SITINFO>

After setting KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV=Y
<SITINFO>
<![CDATA[ATOM=UNIXPS.UCOMMAND;]]>
</SITINFO> 


* The parameter "KFW_CMW_SET_TEC_SEV" was added by ITM 6.1 FP02. Default value is N.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is working as designed.
