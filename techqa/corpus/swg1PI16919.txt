APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Sametime 9 was release in 2013. In the portal versions in the
   field such as version 8001 and 7002 there is no support for
   Sametime 9. This is a conflicting situation where the latest
   product versions from IBM do not work with each other and
   should &#65440; be corrected.
   
   Jusification:
   Indicate why this feature cannot be implemented via the Portal
   Solutions Catalog.
   
   Sametime integration is an OOB core feature for Portal. Hence
   this capability needs to be shipped as a CF rather than a
   catalog update.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  L2 can get
   1. Latest Sametime Contact List Portlet from greenhouse or
   sametime hot fix area.
   2. Latest config.jsp from Dev
   3. Update REP settings for 9.0 as per documentation.
   restart Portlet
