CAUSE
CICS IA V5.1.1 Plug-in requires CICS Explorer V5.1.1. It cannot install into an earlier CICS Explorer version.

ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer V5.1.0; CICS IA plug-in V5.1.1.0

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
See the CICS IA table in "z/OS Explorer, CICS Explorer, and CICS tools plug-ins release compatibility reference tables [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577571#CICSIA]" for compatibility between CICS IA plug-in versions and CICS Explorer versions.

If you upgrade CICS Explorer to V5.1.1 you should be able to install the IA V5.1.1 plug-in.

If you cannot upgrade CICS Explorer, you can obtain the previous CICS IA V5.1.0.1 IA plug-in from "CICS Explorer downloads for older releases of CICS Explorer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031508]" until you are able to upgrade.
