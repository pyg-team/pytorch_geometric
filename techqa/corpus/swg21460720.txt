 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What kind of information is collected by the XU memory profiler ? Where can it be accessed ? 

ANSWER
The agent, when enabled, will retrieve the information about estimated memory usage for the ruleset. A definite value for "rulesetEstimatedMemorySize" in the XU dump can be seen, when the profiler is enabled. The following screenshot shows where this information can be found:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21460720&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21460720&aid=1]

To view this information on Rule Execution Server console, one needs to execute a sample rule application on Rule Execution Server. For this purpose, a simple HelloWorld rule application is provided in this tech-note. Follow these steps:

1. Deploy the ruleapp jar file using the Rule Execution Server console 
2. Set the log level of Rule Execution Server to "Debug" on "Server Info" tab of Rule Execution Server
3. Execute the ruleapp using Rule Execution Server console

Once the ruleapp is executed, you should be able to see a similar information in the XU dump. 


Note: the path to the Java agent for XU memory profiling may be erroneous in the product documentation, refer to APAR RS00553 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1RS00553]
