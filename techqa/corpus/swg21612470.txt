CICS TS V5.1 introduces a wide range of other technical and operational capabilities. For more details about CICS TS V5.1 see the US Announcement letter for CICS TS 5.1 [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS212-325] (212-325). Information for other country announcements is available on the IBM Offering Information page [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/index.wss]. 

CICS Explorer [http://www.ibm.com/cics/explorer] has been upgraded to CICS Explorer V5.1. This is a major update to support the latest CICS TS and CICS tools capabilities. Some CICS TS V5.1 capabilities, such as applications, platforms and policies, require the CICS Explorer for creation and deployment. CICS Explorer V5.1 will also work with other supported versions of CICS TS. 

CICS TS Developer Trial V5.1 is a try-before-you-buy edition of CICS TS V5.1. It has a zero-cost license charge and does not initiate any single version charging (SVC) period. CICS TS Developer Trial contains the complete set of CICS TS features and functions. However, there are a number of imposed restrictions, in performance and capacity, licensing terms, and a fixed expiry date, that make CICS TS Developer Trial suitable only for use in non-production environments. CICS TS Developer Trial V5.1 is available through ShopzSeries as a standard offering. In countries where ShopzSeries is not yet available, contact your IBM representative (or IBM Business Partner) to handle your order using the traditional IBM ordering process.
