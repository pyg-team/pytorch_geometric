   Title:  The manager attribute value on person should be case
   insensitive
   
   Problem Description:  The manager attribute value on a person is
   the DN
   to the person that is set at the manager in the TIM ldap.  This
   value
   should be treated case insensitive in all parts of the TIM
   server code.
   The TIM server code that searches for pending ToDo requests for
   a user
   is case sensitive for this attribute value.  Most of the other
   parts
   of the TIM interface and commands are case insensitive with
   respect to
   the value of the manager attribute on a person.
   
   Because of case differences of the manager attribute value, you
   can get
   into situation where an approval request sent to a manager will
   show
   in pending state and pending approval for the particular manager
   in
   the details of the request.  But when that manager logs into
   ITIM, they
   will not see any waiting request for their approval.
   
   Customer Recreate: Yes, support also able to reproduce the
   behavior.
   
   Desired Behavior: For all parts of the TIM server handle the
   value of
   the manager attribute case insensitive.
   
   Steps to Duplicate: The customer setup was using TDI feed and
   ldap
   connector to lookup of the DN of the manager person to set on
   the new
   person being created in TIM.  The ldap connector lookup would
   return the
   DN of the person in all lower case.  The behavior can also be
   reproduced
   by manually editting the manager attribute value in an ldap
   browser
   to change the case of the value after it is set through the TIM
   interface.
   
   If the value of the manager attribute differs in case from what
   value
   would be set through the TIM interface when defining the value
   of the
   manager/supervisor on the person, then parts of the TIM
   interface do
   not handle the attribute correctly.  An approval request sent to
   the
   manager in a workflow where the case of the manager attribute DN
   is not
   what the TIM server is expecting will result in the request
   never
   showing up in the manager's ToDo list, but the request will show
   in
   pending state and sent to the manager.
   
   Environment: TIM 4.6 FP8 + IF10(same behavior verified at FP21
   level)
