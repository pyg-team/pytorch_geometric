PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TWL Rave Chart widgets display the incorrect hour ( local PET + 1 hour ). This only manifests itself during Daylight Savings time, which is not observed in Peru, and when using time-based datasets. 

SYMPTOM
Displaying a dataset in the Rave Chart Widget where the data is time-based, ( e.g. data for the last two hours ) and during Daylight Savings time, selecting the system name will show the incorrect hour ( local PET + 1 hour ) 

This issue only shows in the TWL Rave chart Widget to determine the identity and version of the widget, please refer to this technote to gather that information:
