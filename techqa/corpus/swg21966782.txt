QUESTION
 How do I determine what CVEs pertain to and are resolved in the various releases of Tivoli Integrated Portal? 

ANSWER
The process to determine what CVEs are addressed in the various TIP releases is as follows: 

Go to the IBM Support Portal: https://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/support [https://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/support] 

Enter the number of the CVE (CVE-####) concerned under "Search support". There you will find information pertaining to any fixes that have been released to Websphere and what fixpack release they are contained in. 

Visit the following link to determine what version of WAS is deployed in your release of TIP. 

What WAS fixpacks are included in TIP fixpacks [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/26d4aa47-4fd6-460d-a93b-3ee8945324d6/entry/what_was_fixpacks_are_included_in_tip_fixpacks?lang=en] 

Determine what version of TIP you have installed:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635265 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21635265]

From there it can be determined if you need to upgrade TIP. 

Please note: WAS cannot be upgraded outside of TIP. There are modifications to the WAS console which need to be made for TIP hence WAS is upgrades are done via TIP Fix Pack.

Also not all releases of software (e.g. WebGUI) are certified with all releases of TIP. It is possible to see if your installation can be upgraded to the TIP release desired. Please see the following technote on how to determine this:
