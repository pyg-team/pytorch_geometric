Title: IBM New datasource "Connections" do not save in DASH 3.1.2.1 CP5 on WAS 8.5.5.9 - United States

Text:
DASHL2; connections; "createAndLinkSharedLib.py"; org.apache.wink.common.internal.http.Accept.valueOf; NullPointerException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the WAS component of Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) 3.1.2.1 WAS upgraded to 8.5.5.9 and DASH 3.1.2.1 CP5 was installed, newly defined datasource "Connections" do not save. 

CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR IV85410

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
WAS 8.5.5.9 hides some jar files that are referenced by DASH. DASH 3.1.2.1 CP5 restores the jar files, but additional library links are needed in order for the replaced jars to be referenced correctly. Without those corrected library links the attempt to save the newly defined connections will generate the following errors in the SystemOut:
