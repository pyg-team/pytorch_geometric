PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In order to perform advanced configuration or debug tasks with IBM i Access Client Solutions, it may be necessary to set Java System properties. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to perform advanced configuration or debug tasks with IBM i Access Client Solutions, it may be necessary to set Java System properties. This document illustrates a few simple ways to set these properties. 

To set the properties through AcsConfig.properties. 
One is located by default in the same location as the acsbundle.jar
<property>=<value> 

ie: java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
or
java.security.krb5.realm=CS4.RCHLAND.IBM.COM

To use Command line:
-D<property>=<value>

ie: acslaunch_win-32.exe -Djava.net.preferIPV4Stack=true
or
java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar acsbundle.jar
(for platforms that do not have executable launchers) 
or
acslaunch_win-32.exe -Djava.security.krb5.realm=CS4.RCHLAND.IBM.COM

To set the properties using Environment Variables 
These are specific to the JRE you are running.

For instance, when using an Oracle JRE, you may set _JAVA_OPTIONS to include arguments to be given to the Java Virtual Machine. On an IBM JRE, you can set IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS. 
_JAVA_OPTIONS="-D<property>=<value>"
IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS="-D<property>=<value>"

ie: set _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.net.preferIPV4Stack=true"
or
set IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.net.preferIPV4Stack=true"

You should consult the documentation for the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) you are using for more details.
