PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You instrument an application with IBM® Rational® Test RealTime™. After that, you run the application from a command line or debugger. Then you get an error as follows.

"Cannot open traces file: No such file or directory" 

CAUSE
Most likely this error appears, when you create the instrumented executable with Test RealTime GUI, and run it from a command line or in a debugger. The Test RealTime GUI creates the executable in the directory, that the target deployment port has specified; usually the directory is:<project>/<target>. The executable runs in the <project> directory and creates the trace files in the ./<target> directory. 

The executable cannot create any trace files, when you run the executable in this directory:<project>/<target>. This is the directory, where it resides. The reason is, that the following directory does not exists: <project>/<target>/<target>. In that case the above error appears. 

It is also possible, that the error comes up, when the user does not have write permissions in the trace directory. Although this directory does exists.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In most cases, you can fix this error, by switching the execution of the application to the correct working directory.
