Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled by default in the Apache based IBM HTTP Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: IBM HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects all versions and releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.


REMEDIATION/FIXES
There is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. 

The update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. 


WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: 


Add the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains "SSLEnable":

# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566
# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7
# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers 
# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.
SSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2

Stop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.

Note: 

 * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the "Include" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.

 * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable


IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
