APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Envrionment:
   
   Operating System: WIN 2000 Server
   Product or Service: IBM Tivoli Identity Manager
   Component ID: 5724C3402
   Product Version/Release: 4.5.1
   Product Fix Level: SAP Agent 4.5.1-1009
   Environment:
   Single server with dual cpu and 2GB  memory
   
   Problem: When doing a recon against a SAP CUA Server where sap
   roles exists in multiple languages, warnings will always be
   generated as the language is not part of the data transferred to
   ITIM.
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   The problem is very easy to recreate if you have a SAP system
   availabl
   the  contains roles in more than on language (I would assume
   that this cove
   99.99% or more of all SAP systems as they have roles in german
   and
   english in the default installation as far as I know...)
   To recreate the problem just run a reconcilation against the SAP
   syste without any filters - there will be warning that some
   roles cannot be loaded (because they are already loaded) as the
   table it reads in the  SAP system contains a row for each
   language the role has a description  for... Whether this will
   doomed an enhancement request or an APAR is not  anything I can
   decide - but clearly from a customer point of view a
   reconciliation should be possible without any warnings on
   correctly setup system - it
   is not now....
