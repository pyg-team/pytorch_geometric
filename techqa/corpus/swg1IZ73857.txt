APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Impact 5.x produces error when using certain EventReader
   Restriction filter conditions. If one runs into this it throws
   the error "rule includes an unsupported expression" when
   clicking on Analyze Filter button. Here's and example of when
   the Filter Analyzer errors out with the following type of filter
   condition:
   Summary != '' AND Summary NOT LIKE 'string'
   
   This same filter condition may have worked fine on Impact
   version 4.0.2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You manually add both the following properties to your
   eventreader's props file, i.e. within the
   $NCHOME/impact/etc/NCI_omnibuseventreader.props file:
   --------------------
   impact.<readername>.uselikeoperator=true
   impact.<readername>.consolidatefilters=false
   --------------------
   Please note this will get the actual filter condition working in
   the eventreader (which is the most important thing), however
   when using the Analyze Filter button it still fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  EVENTREADER FILTER ANALYZER THROWS ERROR WHENEVER CERTAIN FILTER
   CONDITIONS ARE ANALYZED.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The filter analyzer does not support the given filter. The issue
   is fixed in a techNote that is available in the following link:
