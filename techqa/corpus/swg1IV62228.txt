ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  mxe.sec.allowedIP property does not work as expected.
   
   There is a property entitled mxe.sec.allowedIP that is
   described as "Add property to keep a list of IP Addresses that
   should not be blocked".  In our testing, we found that even
   though we set the mxe.sec.allowedIP to never block one of our
   IP addresses, we found that end users could still manually
   enter the IP address in login blocking and the IP address would
   in fact get blocked and prevent the user from logging in.
   
    There is some confusion as to
    how this property works but we would like to never block
    incoming requests from our web proxy servers. In order to
    implement this requirement., we provided a comma separated
    list of IP addresses to the mxe.sec.allowedIP property. Once
    these values were entered, we manually blocked the IP address
    of one of our proxy servers through the Manage Blocked IP
    Address function within the User application. Once this
    host was added to the loginblock object, requests from this
    proxy server started to get redirected to the log out page.
