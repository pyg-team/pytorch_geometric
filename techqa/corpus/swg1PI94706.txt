APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ATTLSAWARE support was introduced into CPSM at version 5.3.
   This support was added for CMCI connectivity only.  The CPSM
   WUI does not require ATTLSAWARE support, it only requires to be
   notified that AT-TLS is being used.  This limitation is because
   the WUI is using absolute URLs which include the http scheme
   header.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICSPlex SM V5R1M0, V5R2M0, V5R3M0 and   *
   *                 V5R4M0 users.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The CICSPlex SM Web User Interface      *
   *                      (CPSM WUI), does not adhere to the      *
   *                      correct application protocol when       *
   *                      running on an Application               *
   *                      Transparent Transport Layer Security    *
   *                      (AT-TLS) enabled port.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, restart all CPSM WUI servers in the    *
   *                 CICSPlex.                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   The CPSM WUI can use either the HTTP or HTTPS application
   protocols for sending and receiving data.
   When the CPSM WUI is configured to run on a port which has
   been enabled with Application Transparent Transport Layer
   Security, (AT-TLS), it is not possible for the CPSM WUI to
   determine that the HTTPS protocol is in use and therefore the
   CPSM WUI may generate a URL with the HTTP protocol when the
   client requires HTTPS to satisfy the connection.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new value of ATTLSBASIC for the optional EYUWUI parameter
   TCPIPSSL has been added which is used to cause the CPSM WUI
   server to run on ports that are configured to run as AT-TLS
   ports by z/OS.
   
   The following documentation changes have been made:
   -------------------
   For version V5R1M0 and V5R2M0:
    -> Configuring
     -> Setting up CICSPlex SM
      -> Setting up a CICSPlexSM Web User Interface server
       -> Web User Interface server initialization parameters
        -> Optional parameters for the WUI
         -> TCP/IP options
   
   The TCPIPSSL option text has been changed to:
   
   TCPIPSSL(YES | NO | ATTLSBASIC)
   Indicates whether you require data encryption between your Web
   User Interface server and web browser.  If you select YES,
   specify the appropriate system initialization parameters to
   enable SSL support in the CICS® Web Interface.  For more
   information, See SSL with CICS web support.
   If TCPIPSSL is set to YES, then TCPIPSSLCERT and
   TCPIPSSLCIPHERS settings will always apply, unless the
   optional CMCISSL parameter is set with the NO value.  If you
   select ATTLSBASIC, you must specify a port via the TCPIPPORT
   EYUWUI parameter which has been enabled for AT-TLS by the z/OS
   Communications Server.  For more information about AT-TLS,
   refer to the appropriate z/OS Knowledge Center, specifically
   the section:
   z/OS Communications Server -> z/OS Communications Sever: IP
   Programmer's Guide and Reference -> Application Transparent
   Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS).
   
   -------------------
   For version V5R3M0 section:
   CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.3.0
   -> Configuring
    -> Setting up CICSPlex SM
     -> Setting up a CICSPlex SM Web User Interface server
      -> Web User Interface server initialization parameters
       -> Optional Parameters for the WUI
        -> TCP/IP Options
   and for V5R4M0 section:
   CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.4.0
   -> Configuring
    -> Setting up CICSPlex SM
     -> Setting up a CICSPlex SM Web User Interface server
      -> Specifying Web User Interface server initialization
         parameters
       -> Optional Parameters for the WUI
        -> TCP/IP Options
   
   The TCPIPSSL option text has been changed to:
   
   TCPIPSSL(YES | NO | ATTLSBASIC)
   Indicates whether you require data encryption between your Web
   User Interface server and web browser.  If you select YES,
   specify the appropriate system initialization parameters to
   enable SSL support in the CICS® Web Interface.  For more
   information, See SSL with CICS web support.
   If TCPIPSSL is set to YES, then TCPIPSSLCERT and
   TCPIPSSLCIPHERS settings will always apply, unless the
   optional CMCISSL parameter is set with the NO value.  If you
   select ATTLSBASIC, you must specify a port via the TCPIPPORT
   EYUWUI parameter which has been enabled for AT-TLS by the z/OS
   Communications Server.  For more information about AT-TLS,
   refer to the appropriate z/OS Knowledge Center, specifically
   the section:
   z/OS Communications Server -> z/OS Communications Sever: IP
   Programmer's Guide and Reference -> Application Transparent
   Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS).
   Furthermore, the CMCI TCPIPSERVICE SSL attribute will be set
   to ATTLSAWARE if TCPIPSSL(ATTLSBASIC) is specified and has not
   been set by the CMCISSL parameter.
