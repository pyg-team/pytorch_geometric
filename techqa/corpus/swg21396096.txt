PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the db2install.sh script to create a new octigate database, the user gets prompted multiple times for the password. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The $MS_HOME/scripts/db2install.sh (Unix) script is used when you want to create a brand new 'octigate' database. 

This script calls two other scripts, viz., db2configuration.sh and db2createschema.sh to actually set the DB2 settings and create the database. 

In these 2 scripts you'll find a lot of "su - " commands. If you are using a user-id that doesn't have the right privileges to run the db2install.sh script, the "su - " commands will prompt you to enter the password multiple times. 

To avoid these multiple prompts, run the db2install.sh script with the right user privileges or use 'root' if you have access to that id.
