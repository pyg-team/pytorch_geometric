ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Validate nodes from the Data Protection for VMware GUI reports a
   successful message, but also reports an error icon.
   The success message reported is:
   ANS0302I (RC0) Successfully done.
   However, a red X icon next the node name suggests an error.
   This behavior can occur when there are no VM guests in the
   environment.
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:
   Review the messages.log file located in C:\IBM\tivoli\tsm\
   tdpvmware\webserver\usr\servers\veProfile\ VMwarePlugin\logs

   [4/13/16 8:51:41:773 PDT] 0000002e SystemOut
   O [queryDMVerify] Synchronous return code: 2
   Running the inquire_detail command manually will result in the
