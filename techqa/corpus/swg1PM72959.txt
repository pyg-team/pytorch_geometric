ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows 7
       - IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA) v8.5
       - IBM Tivoli Service Automation Manager (TSAM) v7.2.2
   
       - IBM Deployment Planning and Automation for the Cloud v2.0
   
       - IBM Rational Build Forge 7.1.3.2 with Rational Automation
   Framework (RAF) v3.0.0.3
   
   Description of problem:
   When IHS is modeled as the front end to a backend WAS
   Application Server and automation is executed and
   IHS Server is created and a corresponding WAS Web Server is
   created in the WAS console but the communication
   between the WAS console and the IHS server will not work because
   the IHS Administration Server is not started during the
   automation process.
   The IHS Administration server must be started as part of the
   automation in order for the communication between IHS and WAS to
   work correctly.
