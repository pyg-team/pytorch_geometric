QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

Question 1:Are we not talking about FileNet? Applying CR4 includes patching FileNet and Cognos 
Answer 1:This Open Mic is in regard to Migration/Upgrade. We had an open Mic on CCM/Filenet last month, but, yes, part of the upgrade to cr4 is to upgrade filenet components. Here's a link to the previous Open Mic with the slides and Q&A: https://ibm.biz/BdRga5 [https://ibm.biz/BdRga5] 

Question 2: This is the first time I got this invite....how can i get notified of future web casts related to connections

Question 3: In side-by-side strategy, the data migration can't occur until production is shut down, right? 
Answer 3: That's correct 

Question 4: When applying CR4, does that affect how the Interim Feature releases are applied? Or are those applied independently? Wondering what the install order would be for a brand new install. Connections 4.5 + CR4 + IF1 and IF2? 

Answer 4: It's the same as per CR3. I believe for IFR2, this is done through the customization directory, when applying Ephox, so this should not impact anything during the application of a CR. Best practice would be to upgrade, and re-apply an IFR. no changes in CR4 with regards to FileNet versions. you need 5.2.0.2 CE, instead of 5.2.0.1
