Title: IBM Errors while running create_schema.sh - United States

test_db.sh connectivity network bufferpools exception verify_tables_indexes.sh TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am trying to install the product with DB2 database. When I run create_schema.sh, I get SQL0552N and/or SQL0403W errors. Why am I getting these errors and how can I prevent them? 

CAUSE
Before using the application, you must create a database schema. This is done by running $TOP/bin/db/create_schema.sh. Since this script will create data structures like tables and indexes, the database user of the application must have the necessary permissions to be able to run this script successfully. 

If the database user does not have these permissions, then we will get SQL0552N and/or SQL0403W errors usually in the following form:
===== ERROR SQL0552N "Database_User" does not have the privilege to perform operation 

OR

===== ERROR SQL0403W The newly defined alias "Database_User.XYZ" resolved to the object
===== ERROR SQLSTATE=01522 
===== ERROR SQLSTATE=42601
where XYZ is the table name.


ANSWER
As the error text suggests, SQL0552N means the database user does not have the necessary permissions to be able to create/edit data structures like tables. To correct this error, give the database user the following permissions: 

1. CREATETAB
2. BINDADD
3. CONNECT
4. CREATE_NOT_FENCED
5. IMPLICIT_SCHEMA
6. LOAD ON DATABASE

Meanwhile, SQL0403W is got when the table or view being referenced does not exist. The reason for this may be that the user does not have the necessary table space usage permissions. As of version 10.1.0, the database user needs usage permission for following tablespaces: USERS, INDX, BLOB_TBL_DATA, XML_DATA, XML_LARGE_DATA. 
If you are using custom tablespace mapping file with the following tablespaces
ICM_DATA, ICM_IX, ITM_DATA, ITM_IX, ITD_DATA, ITD_IX, ITA_DATA, ITA_IX, LCK_DATA, and LCK_IX, then you should provide necessary usage permissions for the same.
