ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use the Show Instances function from the Report Viewer
   widget to the Instances widget, the instances you expect are not
    displayed if a custom filter has been added to a Cognos BI
   report by using a Cognos BI tool such as Business Insight
   Advanced. The "Showing instances" topic
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.mon.widget.cognos.doc/topics/reportviewershowinst.html)
   explains this restriction for IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1.
   
   PRODUCT AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Monitor
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Custom Cognos BI filters created by using advanced Cognos BI
   report functions such Business Insight Advanced are not applied
   when you use the Show Instances context menu option from the
   Report Viewer widget.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix has been incorporated into IBM Business Monitor V8.5.6 so
   that the Show Instances option on the Report Viewer widget
   context menu now supports the following Cognos BI custom
   filters, which are sent as filter definitions.
   
   Filters Menu
   Include, Exclude, >, >=, <, <= (Between and Not Between are not
   supported.)
   
   Create Custom Filter
   - Before auto aggregation ("After auto aggregation" is not
   supported.)
   - Custom based on data item ("Combined" is not supported.)
   - Condition: Show only the following values ("Do NOT show the
   following values" is not supported.)
   - Numeric operators: >, >=, <, <=
   - String operators: contains, matches, containsNot, matchesNot,
   isNull, isNotNull (beginsWith, endsWith, beginsWithNot,
   endsWithNot are not supported.)
   - Multiple conditions: You can combine multiple conditions
   using AND. All conditions must be met for the filter to take
   effect. (Combining multiple conditions using OR and / or NOT is
   not supported.)
   - Summary filters are not supported.
   
   Date Time Filter
   Only one date time filter is supported and it can be combined
   with multiple conditions using AND. For example, "Date in
   January" and "Date in February" is not supported.
