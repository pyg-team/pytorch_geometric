PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DWC JCL EDIT of JCL for a mainframe job, a Centralized Script, or a zCentric job cannot use any of the ISPF EDIT COPY or IMPORT functionality which is available when performing the same task via the TWSZ ISPF dialogs. 

CAUSE
The Distributed Workload Console accesses the TWSz CONTROLLER via a PIF connection between the CONTROLLER and the TWSz PIF/GUI SERVER STARTED TASK. This is not an ISPF environment, thus no ISPF EDIT functions can be accessed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is a restriction of the DWC-to-CONTROLLER communication implementation, and cannot be directly addressed within the current design. However, beginning with TWSz V8R6, the DWC has the ability to read from and write to any library in the EQQJBLIB concatenation, and to create new members independent of scheduled jobs in the TWSz CURRENT PLAN. 

While this does not enable the ISPF edit functions, it is now possible to read one member, copy it to the clipboard, and paste the results into a different member, thus achieving the same result in a different manner.
