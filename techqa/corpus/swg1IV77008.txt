ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APMUI v7.7 has function to link to tep workspace from APMUI
   groupwidget,
   and in this case customer need to input u/p for TEP login. To
   convenient;y link to TEP without inputing u/p, we need to
   configure SSO
   between APMUI and TEPS.
   Customer tried to configure the SSO when TEPS is configured with
   HTTP
   port number, and it worked. But when they configure TEPS from
   HTTP to
   HTTPS, the SSO will not work and they will still need to input
   u/p.
   I checked with original APMUI SVT team that they had verified
   the SSO
   configuration steps with TEPS HTTP port number, and there has
   completed
   document, but it was not published at that time. We need to
   publish the
   document and we should also clearly state whether we support the
   SSO
   configuration when TEPS is configured with HTTPS port number.
   For this
   purpose we need to investigate & verify the SSO configuration
   steps for
   HTTPS port number firstly.
