APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Wikis, changing the Alternative text of a n image does not
   change
   the image title value in the HTML DOM element <img />
   So when a user does a mouse over event the image title never
   changes.
   
   1. Create a wiki, edit the page and insert an image. and make
   sure you
   add some text to "Alternate Text" field .. lets say we call
   this image
   "tea.png" and  the alt text is "MACAROON" ....
   
   2 Once image is added to the Wiki page, open the DOM inspector.
   and you
   will see this HTML :
   <img
   src="/wikis/form/anonymous/api/wiki/dafff408-714d-4865-b8ad-a111
   691fdfc0
   /page/e597ebaf-5cc7-4146-a8eb-823ca440769f/attachment/6454cfb7-b
   dae-458d
   -ab8d-431a2d0e7d8d/media/tea.png" lconnwikimacro="image"
   lconnwikiparamwikipage="GOLD"
   lconnwikiparamattachmentname="tea.png"
   title="MACAROON" alt="MACAROON">
   
   3 Hover over image with mouse pointer and image title is
   displayed as
   MACAROON.
   
   4 Right click on image and CKEditor Menu displays. Select "image
   properties".
   
   5 Update alternative text to "COCONUT" and click ok.
   
   6 Hover over image with mouse pointer and image title is still
   displayed.as MACAROON
