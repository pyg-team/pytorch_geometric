CVE ID: CVE-2013-4286 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-4286] 

Description: Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.47, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC3, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector is used, does not properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification of a request's length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1) multiple Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426] for the current score

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0033 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0033] 

Description: org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java in Apache Tomcat 6.0.33 through 6.0.37 does not consider the disableURLRewriting setting when handling a session ID in a URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks via a crafted URL.

CVE ID: CVE-2013-4322 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-4322] 

Description: Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 processes chunked transfer coding without properly handling (1) a large total amount of chunked data or (2) whitespace characters in an HTTP header value within a trailer field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3544.

CVE ID: CVE-2013-4590 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-4590] 

Description: Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 allows attackers to obtain "Tomcat internals" information by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web application with a context.xml, web.xml, *.jspx, *.tagx, or *.tld XML document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0075 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0075] 

Description: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked request. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. 

CVSS Base Score: 5

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0095 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0095] 

Description: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of an AJP request. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume a request processing thread and cause a denial of service.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0096 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0096] 

Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data by the default server. By sending specially-crafted XML data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0099 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0099] 

Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check for overflows when parsing content length headers. By sending specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
