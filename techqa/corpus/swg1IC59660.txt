ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   A Fan Out primitive can have multiple flows from it that
   eventually lead to a corresponding Fan In primitive. If the
   'stop' terminal of this Fan In primitive is triggered it will
   fire it's 'incomplete' terminal.  This should stop the 'Fan
   Out/Fan In' flows, but any of the multiple flows that have not
   yet been executed will process at this point and will result in
   the following exception, as messages in the other flows are
   processed after the Fan In primitive has stopped:
   
   FlowActionPolicyException: CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have
   been produced for a single request flow in module

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.1.2 or       *
   *                 v6.2 who wish to use Fan In/Fan Out          *
   *                 primitives with multiple paths.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A Fan Out primitive does not check      *
   *                      that it's corresponding Fan In          *
   *                      primitive is able to accept messages    *
   *                      before firing messages through          *
   *                      remaining paths through the             *
   *                      mediation.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you use Fan In/Fan Out combinations       *
   *                 with multiple paths and require processing   *
   *                 of any remaining paths to stop after the     *
   *                 Fan In primitive has had it's 'stop'         *
   *                 terminal triggered, you are advised to       *
   *                 install the fix pack which contains the      *
   *                 code update associated with this APAR.       *
   ****************************************************************
   The Fan Out primitive does not check the state of it's
   corresponding Fan In primitive before firing a message through
   any remianing paths. If the Fan In primitive has had it's
   ''stop' terminal triggered, it will not be expecting to receive
   any further messages.
   As the Fan Out primitive does not check
   this, it will continue to send these messages, and when they
   arrive at the Fan In, the observed exception is seen.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the Fan Out primitive is now
   able to check the state of it's corresponding Fan In primitive.
   
   There are no known side effects associated with this fix.
   There is no known alternative workaround should you encounter
