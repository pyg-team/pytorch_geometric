QUESTION
 When accessing the DataPower appliance through the Web Management Service (WebGUI), you may be greeted with one of the following messages: 

* Internet Explorer
"There is a problem with this website's security certificate.
- Click here to close this webpage.
- Continue to this website (not recommended)."

* Firefox
"This Connection is Untrusted
- Get me out of here!
- Add Exception..." 

CAUSE
By default, DataPower uses a self-signed certificate (signed by DataPower Technology, Inc.) with its Web Management Service (WebGUI). The certificate is not signed by a well-known Certificate authority (CA). The signer is not included in the list of trusted third parties with internet browsers, and therefore the connection is flagged as "Untrusted".

ANSWER
There is an option to replace the certificate used by the DataPower Web Management Service (WebGUI) with a certificate of your choice (for example, a certificate signed by your own organization or a certificate signed by a well-known trusted third party CA). 

To replace the certificate, in the WebGUI: 

 1. Navigate to Control Panel -> Network -> Management -> Web Management Service 
 2. Switch to the Advanced tab. 
 3. Select or create one of the Custom SSL server types with the corresponding certificate for the Web Management Service:  * Use a Server Profile with the Custom SSL server profile 
     * Use a Server SNI Profile with the Custom SSL SNI server profile 
     * Use a reverse or two-way Proxy Profile (deprecated) with the Custom SSL proxy profile (deprecated)
       
    
    

Note: If you use an SSL Proxy Profile, which is deprecated, you must use one that is defined with the SSL direction as reverse or two-way. The SSL Proxy Profile applied to the Web Management Service acts as an SSL server in the SSL communication. A profile that is defined with the forward SSL Direction, such as the included system-wsgw-management-loopback SSL Proxy Profile, acts as an SSL client. A forward or client SSL Proxy Profile causes an Error 500: Internal Error when it is applied to the Web Management Service.
