APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the correlation of received delivery notifications in MSIF
   fails in MSIF due to the fact, that the transfer reference for
   the related SendFile Transfer is not known, Error events are
   created currently and the Delivery Notification is put to the
   backout queue.
   This causes unnecessary actions for the customer, as
   - the error events may cause callouts
   - there is no meaningful actions to handle the backed-out
   delivery notification rather then just deleting the messages.
   
   Therefore, handling of errors when correlating delivery
   notifications should be changed in a way that
   - the events are changed to informational
   - backout of the delivery notifications is omitted
   - when correlation via transfer reference is not possible,
   correlation should be tried via the logical filename, if this is
   included in the delivery notification, and new informational
   events should be written, if this correlation is successful.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ignore events DNFO2057E and DNFO1017E, and delete the backed-out
   delivery notifications from the backout queue

   ****************************************************************
   If in an MSIF SendFile scenario for Realtime the delivery
   notification is received from the correspondent, then MSIF
   tries to correlate the delivery notification with the SendFile
   scenario using the SWIFT transfer reference.
   In error situations this correlation can fail, for example if
   the Sw:ExchangeFileResponse was lost or is received after the
   delivery notification.
   Formerly, in such error situations MSIF issued one of the
   events DNFO2056E or DNFO2057E and put the delivery notification
   into a backout queue, even if the recovery mechanism of the
   SendFile transfer automatically resolved the error situation
   later on.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, the correlation has been improved and the delivery
   notification is not put into the backout queue anymore.
   In a first step it is tried to correlate the delivery
   notification using the SWIFT transfer reference as before.
   If the first correlation fails, then it is tried to correlate
   the delivery notification using the logical file name.
   If the second correlation fails too, then one of the modified
   events DNFO2056I or DNFO2057I is issued. If the second
   correlation succeeds, then one of the new events DNFO2060I or
   DNFO2061I is issued that contain additional hints about
   the SendFile scenario.
