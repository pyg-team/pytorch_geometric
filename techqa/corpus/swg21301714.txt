QUESTION
 Why do I need to verify the SQL Injection File Write test? This technote provides many common questions along with answers to assist with understanding and using this functionality. 

ANSWER
 

 1. Why do I need to verify this test?
    
    As noted in the Advisory, it is impossible for IBM Rational AppScan Standard to access the SQL Server file system. Therefore, it will always require user verification whether this test succeeded or not. This specific SQL Injection variant attempts to write text composed of the vulnerable script and parameter name to a file on the local file system.
    
    
 2.  What do I need to do to verify this test succeeded?
    
    To do this, after AppScan has finished testing, you need to access the SQL Server machine, either physically or through a remote connection, and check if a file named "AppScanSQLTest.txt" exists under its root directory such as C:\AppScanSQLTest.txt. If it does, it will contain a list of all the vulnerable scripts and parameters.
    
    
 3. How do I enable this test?
    
    There are two parts to this test. The first part is the actual test variants which are 
    
    attSQLInjectionFileWrite:SQLInjectionFileWrite 
    & 
    attSQLInjectionFileWriteNumber:SQLInjectionFileWriteNumeric. 
    
    They can be found under the "SQL Injection Command Execution" header in the Test Policy section of the Scan Configuration. The second part is the "vulnerability" that displays in the results screen to remind you to verify the results on the SQL Server. This is the "SQL Injection File Write" test from the test policy. 
    
    Note: Simply enabling the "SQL Injection File Write" test will not send the payload, you must enable the variants under "SQL Injection Command Execution". You can just enable the actual test variants under SQL Command Injection Execution and the payloads will be sent, but the reminder to check the SQL Server's file system for the file will not appear. Below is a screenshot of the tests and variants that need to be turned on in order to have the test run, and the reminder show up in the scan results

 4. Why are there two parts to this test?
    
    Unlike other tests in AppScan where it is easy to correlate the test request to the vulnerable parameter, the SQL Injection File Write test is sent on all parameters discovered on the site. Because AppScan cannot validate the test results, rather than displaying a vulnerability for each parameter that AppScan tested, it was decided to have the Test Advisory separate from the variants so the variants can test each parameter on the application, but only one Test Advisory will be displayed in the results.
