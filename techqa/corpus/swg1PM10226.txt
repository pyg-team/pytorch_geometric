ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CQ Web Multiline text fields scroll to top in modify mode when t
   hey lose focus
   
   
   
   When modifying a defect that has lots off data in a multiline te
   xt field
   and you've scrolled down, changing focus away from the field cau
   ses it
   to scroll back to the top.  The cursor location doesn't move.  A
   n
   example of why this is an issue is:
   
   I'm modifying a defect that has a long description.  I've scroll
   ed to
   the bottom to see the text, then switch over to my email to comp
   are
   some data.  As soon as I click outside of the text box the view
   scrolls
   back to the top so I can't see the bottom, where I need to compa
   re the
   data.
   
   This only happens in modify mode.  View mode stays in the locati
   on
   you've scrolled to.
