APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are deploying a UNIX, Linux, or Mac version of "IBM SPSS
   Statistics Concurrent User Licensing Server 21.0 English
   Multiplatform eAssembly (CRK3GEN)" and creating a redundant pool
   of license servers utilizing IPv6.  You follow the documentation
   which refers you to the "IBM SPSS Concurrent Licensing Tools 9.5
   - License Manager Administrator Microsoft Windows English
   (CI8Z8EN)" package and specifically the "WrlfTool.exe"
   executable for creating the redundant server file (lservrlf)
   used by the servers in the redundant pool.
   
   You find that having created the "lservrlf" file in this way
   your clients cannot find licenses and your License Administrator
   tool (WlmAdmin.exe) does not recognize licenses on these
   servers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For this scenario, the 'WrlfTool.exe' is really only appropriate
   for deployments on a Windows environment.  For Unix, Linux, and
   Mac OS X, use the command line tool 'rlftool' found in the
   licensing components installation path.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of Statistis client License Manager 9.5.0.0  on    *
   * Unix/Linux wishing to monitor their redundant license pool   *
   * via command line rather than MS Windows-specific             *
   * Administration Tool.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * In our documentation we direct the end user to create the    *
   * redundant license file using the SLM 8.5 Tools               *
   * (WrlfTool.exe)                                               *
   * This is approrpriate only for license managers deployed to   *
   * MS Windows, as these are the only SLM 8.5 we make available  *
   * for our users.  Unix, Linux and Mac all have SLM version     *
   * 8.2.x.  Directing these users to the SLM 8.5 WrlfTool.exe    *
   * sets them up to fail in Japanese, IPv6 environments, as the  *
   * SLM 8.2.x licenseManagers will not unserstand the '~'        *
   * separator.                                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * This issue has been addressed in  the Statistics Client      *
   * License Manager 9.5.0.2                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Please upgrade to Statistics 23.0 and the Statistics Client
   License Manager 9.5.0.2
