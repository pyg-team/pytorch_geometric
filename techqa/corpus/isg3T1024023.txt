Title: IBM Question about sessions and slot usage - United States

Text:
session allocation TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Jobs that have multiple sessions (with multiple tasks) on a limited number of Grid slots. Customer see that one session is using all the slots at a time and once all the tasks get complete, the next session kicks in and so on.

For example:

There are two sessions in a 10 slots cluster: high priority sessionA and low priority sessionB. SessionA has 10 tasks, 5 tasks are running and another 5 tasks have been finished. While, sessionB only has 1 task and the task status is pending.

Only after sessionA is closed, the task in sessionB could get a slot and start running. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the scheduling policy is R_PriorityScheduling, this symptom will be triggered. This is default behavior.
