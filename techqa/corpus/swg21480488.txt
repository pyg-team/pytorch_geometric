 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have tried to use SPSS Statistics Export node in my Clementine/Modeler stream. 

But, I got the following message: "SPSS could not be started. Check the path to the executable is specified correctly in the Helper Applications dialog". 

How can I solve this problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You are getting this error because your Clementine/Modeler hasn't been configured to work with SPSS Statistics application. 

To configure Clementine/Modeler to work with SPSS and other applications, choose Helper Applications from the Tools menu.

If Statistics is installed on your computer, you can configure Clementine to send data to SPSS using the SPSS Export node. 

Statistics Interactive: Enter the name of the command to execute Statistics in interactive mode (usually, paswstat.exe in the Statistics program directory).

Connection: If Statistics Server is located on the same server as Clementine/Modeler Server, you can enable a connection between the two applications, which increases efficiency by leaving data on the server during analysis. Select Server to enable the Port option below. The default setting is Local. 

Port. Specify the server port for SPSS Statistics Server.

Statistics License Location Utility: Click on this button and browse to the Statistics program installation directory on the client computer.
