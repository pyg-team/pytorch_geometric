PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Soft delete a item on syndicator, after syndication,item is not
   deleted on subscriber.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Soft delete a item will create a version, so there will be entry
   in the event log, deletion and update, which end up with the
   same scenario as move item across library.  Add logic to
   distinguish the case soft deletion and moving item across
   libraries.
