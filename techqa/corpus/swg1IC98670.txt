APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DataPower 7.0 firmware generates OAuth token "url safe" per
   RFC 4648.
   
   In a cluster environment, if the 7.0 generated token is
   used/verified by a prior firmware, crypto verification (decrypt
   and verify) fails if the token contains "/" or "+".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Token validation might fail if the token is not URL-encoded but
   safe per RFC 4648.
   
   For a pre-7.0 releases of DataPower to verify the tokens
   generated by firmware 7.0, this fix is required.
   
   Tokens generated using pre-7.0 firmware releases of DataPower
   still need to be url-encoded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.14, 6.0.0.6, and 6.0.1.2.
