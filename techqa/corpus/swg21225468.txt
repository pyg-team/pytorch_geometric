 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Error when trying to set delimiters for large databases. If you attempt to change the partition delimiter for a large database using the following steps:
1. In the IBM DB2 Records Manager Administrator 
client, click Tools > System Configuration.
2. For the Partition Delimiter field, set it to "." 
(do not include the quotation marks).
3. For the Placeholder field, set it to "..." 
(do not include the quotation marks).
4. Click Save.
You will encounter a timeout error. 

CAUSE
Your current transaction timeout value in WebSphere Application Server is not sufficient and needs to be increased.

ANSWER
To change the transaction timeout period: 

 1. Start the WebSphere Administrative Console.
2. From the navigation menu, click Application Servers > Server1 > Transaction Service.
3. In the Total transaction lifetime timeout field, 
change the value. 
Note: An exact value cannot be specified in this technote because the 
value depends on your current hardware configuration. Begin by
incrementing this number in 15 minute periods until the timeout error 
no longer occurs.
4. Save your changes.
5. Re-start your WebSphere Application Server.

In addition, you can also change the timeout period for the Web Container session, and HTTP maximum time to receive a request. 

To change the values for these settings:
1. Start the WebSphere Administrative Console.
2. From the navigation menu, click Servers > Application Servers.
3. Select Server1 from the table, select Web Container, 
and then click Session Management.
4. In the Session timeout field, 
change the value to the same value that was set in the previous step.
5. For IBM HTTP server, change the timeout value to the value that you specified earlier seconds, but you will need to multiply this value by 60 because this field refers to the number of seconds.
6. Save your changes.
7. Re-start your WebSphere Application Server.
