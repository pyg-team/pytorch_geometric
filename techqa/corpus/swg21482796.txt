Title: IBM Is there a way to schedule updates to an Excel spreadsheet saved to the repository with associated queries? - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We're using the ShowCase addin for Excel and saving those Excel spreadsheets to the repository. Is there a way to schedule updates to an Excel spreadsheet saved to the repository with associated queries? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here's how to schedule an XLR to be refreshed in C&DS:

1 - Create a query (or queries) and save it to the repository
2 - Create a spreadsheet linked to the query(ies) in the repository as an XLR (or XLRM) - this is done by saving the spreadsheet to the repository using the ShowCase addin (not by dragging and dropping)
3 - Both the spreadsheet and linked queries need to be in the same directory in the repository
4 - Create a new job and add the spreadsheet
5 - Configure the schedule and notification options as desired

The key to it all is making sure the XLR and DBQ's are all in the same directory. You need to save them to the repository, not drag and drop (which won't configure the Excel spreadsheet as a web-enabled spreadsheet).

The job must be run from an Enterprise Server PC, which must have Microsoft Excel installed.
