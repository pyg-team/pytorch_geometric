LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The resolve_initial_references call from the interceptor
   registration code failed to establish a connection, subsequently
   causing the ORB not to complete initialization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR13
   .
   The ORB code has been modified to ensure that any thread
   creating or accepting a connection during the ORB initialization
   phase is made aware that some of the plugin variables are
   subject to change once the ORB completes initialization.
