CAUSE
IBM Installation Manager requires GTK libraries to support the graphical user interface. If the environment does not have required library, or the library version is higher or lower than the requirement, Installation Manager fails when it is starting. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the required GTK libraries according to the Required gtk libraries for Installation Manager on AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631478] document.
