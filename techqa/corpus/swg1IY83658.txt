APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  (At least) the ADO performance counters on a NLS environment (eg
   French) are in the native language (in this case French).  ADO
   6.1 Agent assumes only English performance counters, and thus
   fails to collect any metrics for ADO.
   
   Possible solution is to use the Performance Counter ID instead,
   rather than the textual string of the performance counter.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ADO Agent is not supported in languages other
   than English. The current ADO Agent is supported only on the
   English language version of the OS. The Agent doesn't display
   any workspace values or fails to run on languages other
   than English.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  FIXED IN PATCH 6.1.0-TIV-ITM_ADO-LA0002.
