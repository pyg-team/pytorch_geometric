   ****************************************************************
   When using a channel with an SSLPEER attribute defined, if the
   channel enters retry state it may leak cell pool storage which
   can be identified by large numbers of the 'XSPNPOOL' identifier.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Processing has been amended to ensure that the storage is freed
   when the channel enters retry state.
