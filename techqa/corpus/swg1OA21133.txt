PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All OMEGAMON II for CICS users.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When attempting to initialize OMEGAMON  *
   *                      in CICS, message 'OC1144 EXEN PROCESS   *
   *                      ENABLE TRUE I' is issued and OMEGAMON   *
   *                      is not initialized in that region.      *
   *                      Following that any attempts to          *
   *                      initialize/terminate OMEGAMON fail      *
   *                      with message.  OC1014 OCOMEG BYPASS     *
   *                      IS SET, KOCOME00 PROCESSING             *
   *                      TERMINATING.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   A previous attempt to remove OMEGAMON from the region
   failed because one of the OMEGAMON exits was being
   accessed by another task.  This caused the exit to remain
   in an enabled state.  Further attempts to initialize
   OMEGAMON fail because the exit is already enabled.  Once this
   occurs processing of OMEGAMON commands is bypassed until the
   CICS region is recycled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *    OMEGAMON remove processing was changed to wait and then retry
     disabling exits that are being accessed by another task.  If
     after several retries the exit is still being accessed
     OMEGAMON will revert to a state as if an OMEG SHUT had
     occurred.
   
     The following new message was added to the product.
   
     OC1038 GLUE|TRUE IN USE, OMEGAMON II CANNOT BE DE-INSTALLED
   
     Explanation: The OMEGAMON TRUE or GLUE was in use at the time
     that an OMEG REMOVE was being performed.
   
     System Action: The TRUE or GLUE is not removed and OMEGAMON
     is reset to a status as if an OMEG SHUT had been performed.
   
     User Response: Retry the remove and if the problem persists
     contact OMEGAMON support.  An OMEG INIT can be performed to
     restart OMEGAMON functions using the previously loaded code.
