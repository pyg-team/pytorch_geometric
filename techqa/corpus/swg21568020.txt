 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I enable and disable logging into the NPS Admin GUI Client without a password? 

ANSWER
The Admin GUI client allows for encrypted passwords to be stored on the local client machines. This document shows how to enable the feature and undo it. 

To cache the password for a user do the following:

1. Launch NPS Admin GUI client.
2. Enter NPS server hostname.
3. Enter NPS server username.
4. Enter NPS server password for the username in Step 3.
5. Check the "save encrypted password locally" box.

You will now be able to log on using only a hostname and username. The password will be supplied from the stored encrypted value.








If you would like to undo this and remove the encrypted password from the system, you need to delete the password from the Windows registry. 

1. Click the Start Menu. 
2. Choose: Run 
3. Type: regeditto launch the editor 
4. Navigate to the following key: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Netezza\PasswordCache 
5. Locate the key with a name of: Entries 

The encrypted password is stored in the format: 

192.168.3.194:admin:2:6GM9QiaUKjNo$CGLv4O0MsmI= 

6. Remove the value for the host or user for which you want to clear the encrypted password. 

The NPS Admin GUI client login will revert to the normal procedure of requiring a password.
