Title: IBM AAA-SYS-0002 during restart with Custom Java Authentication Provider (CJAP) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 During restart, a system with a Customer Java Authentication Provider returns "AAA-SYS-0002 The service cannot process the request because it has not been initialized." 

CAUSE
Missing key definition in cjap.properties

ANSWER
It was determined through the cogserver.log that the full error message being received was as follows: 

AAA-SYS-0002 The service cannot process the request because it has not been initialized.
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key securitydb.sql_custom_props 

On examination of the cjap.properties file, it was noted that there was no entry present for the key "securitydb.sql_custom_props" due to an accidental deletion. Restoration of the cjap.properties file resolved the error, and Cognos 10 was again able to start properly.
