ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment  : APMv8 DB2 agent
   1. Operating System : All Supported OS
   2. DB2 Agent : 07.10.06.00
   3. DB2 Server  : All Supported versions
   
   Problem Description:
   An issue was found as, the SQL query used for data collection of
   'KUD_DB2_Table' attribute group taking more time
   for execution, which is hampering the data collection of other
   attribute
   groups and ultimately showing No data
   on APMUI.
   
   Detailed Re-creation Procedure:
   1. Installed DB2 Saas Agent 8.1.3.1.
   2. Request to 'KUD_DB2_Table'attribute group via 'Top 5 tables
   by Read
   Rate' widget on UI.
   3. Observe the data shown by other widgets including 'Top 5
   tables by
   Read Rate' widget on UI.

   Exit
   (2017/03/08,14:35:36.1828-5:kuddtagt.cpp,114,"TakeSample") Exit
   
   This clearly denotes that it's taking nearby 13+ minutes for
   data
   collection of 'KUD_DB2_Table' attribute group, whereas data
   collection
   interval is set to 5 minutes.
