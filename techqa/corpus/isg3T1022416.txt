Title: IBM The extra leap second has no impact to job scheduling and execution, data loading and reporting, and administration of IBM Platform Computing products - United States

 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) recently announced that an extra second will be injected into civil time at the end of June 30th, 2015. This means that the last minute of June 30th, 2015 will have 61 seconds. If a clock is synchronized to the standard civil time, it will show an extra second 23:59:60 on that day between 23:59:59 and 00:00:00. 

CONTENT
The extra leap second has no impact to job scheduling and execution, data loading and reporting, and administration of IBM Platform Computing products. This is because both LSF and Symphony scheduling cycle and data loader collection intervals are all rounded to seconds, and product code properly handles display of this extra second in both GUI and CLI. 
There might be minor impact to display of Symphony tasks that are started and completed within the leap second, the task start time might be shown as later than end time. However, no impact to execution of such tasks.
