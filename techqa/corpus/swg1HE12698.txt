PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM_Content_Collector_Outlook_Extension V4.0.1.5 failed in
   silent installation while using Windows 10 Build 1703
   
   Getting following error -
    Please check your registration: Schluessel: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ .NET Framework Setup \ NDP \ v4 \ Full
      Value Name: Version
      Status: Successful
    .Net Framework 4.5.1 is not installed.
      Status: Error

   As per ICC prerequisites .NET Framework 4.5 or later is
   supported. With latest Windows 10 build, .NET Framework 4.7 is
   shipped.
   Outlook Extension silent/console installation is currently
   unable to detect the .NET framework version 4.7.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The same issue with GUI installation has been already handled in
    APAR HE12666 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HE12666] (fixed with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 FP5
   release).
   Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 FP6 release, the
   Outlook Extension silent and console installation has been also
   fixed and it will detect the .Net Framework 4.7 pre-requisite.
