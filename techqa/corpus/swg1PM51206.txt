   The DB2 Administration Tool for z/OS GEN and Compare
   function create DDL with lower case characters in a
   SCHEMA statement not enclosed in double quotes, which
   results in a SQLCODE -713 / SQLCODEN713 when executed:
   
   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -713, ERROR:
   THE REPLACEMENT VALUE FOR CURRENT SCHEMA IS INVALID
   DSNT418I SQLSTATE   = 3F000 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Programs have been corrected to enclose the schema name in
   double quotes if the schema is not an ordinary identifier.
   (An ordinary identifier is an uppercase letter followed
   by zero or more characters, each of which is an uppercase
   letter, a digit, or the underscore character, and is not
   a reserved word.)
