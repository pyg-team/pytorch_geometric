ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***Overview
   
   If the user group has "grant access" for "approve work order"
   checked in the options section then the status "waiting for
   material" is available, even if the security option "Set work
   order status to waiting for materials" is unticked.
   
   Reproduced the problem on Maximo 6.2.2 and 6.2.1.
   
   Checked with P&T and they response.

   So adding a APAR.
   
   
   ****Steps to reproduce.
   
   1. created a group WMATL and user WMATLUSER they have access to
   work order application and at least one site.
   
   2. Uncheck the work order option
   "set Work Order status to Waiting for Materials".
   
   3. Make sure the option
   
   "grant access" for "approve work order"
   
   4. Create a workorder and attempt change the status to waiting
   materials.
   
   
   I found on Maximo 6.2.2 it would allow me to change the status
   to WMATL on a workorder, even though the security setting was
   switched off.
   
   
   
   
   Client using Maximo 6.2.2
   
   I reproduced this on Maximo 6.2.2 seems to be a bug or
   miss-reading what this permission allows.
