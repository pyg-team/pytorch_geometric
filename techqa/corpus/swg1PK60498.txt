APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Configuring multiple jvms either through GUI or silent install
   appends
   multiple jvm names to GC_LOG_PATH.  Here is a short description:
   Since the dcInputs.txt file is both input to and output from the
   config
   tool, there are some interesting effects.  I ran a config with
   just
   three JVMs, but the gc log file string was still very long.
   I figured that the config tool was reading the GC_LOG_PATH from
   dcInputs.txt, and just keeping it.  I tried manually removing
   this line
   from dcInputs.txt, and it after running config_dc, it put the
   entry
   back in there again.   including more than just the three JVMs I
   configured, but less than the 19 that were already configured:
   GC_LOG_PATH=${LOG_ROOT}/pin_01_native_stderr.mbr_utilities_01.mk
   tgrt_01.
   low_impact_01.life_01.imco_invest_01.imco_01.gen_utilities_01.
   ent_logon_emp_01.ent_logon_01.ent_home_01.ent_common_01.ent_acco
   unts_01.
   log
   Configured JVMS were pin_01, mbr_utilities_01, mktgrt_01,
   low_impact_01, life_01, imco_invest_01, imco_01,
   gen_utilities_01,
   ent_logon_emp_01, ent_logon_01, ent_home_01, ent_common_01,
   ent_accounts_01, bkoffice_01, ent_services_01, crm56_svcs_01,
   ent_edd_01, bk_preapps_01, rip_01
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Hotfix created.
   
   Note
   
   1. The hotfix contain a README file and config_DC.jar which need
   to be
   used to replace the existing FP3_iFix2 version of config_DC.jar
   
   2. The hotfix contain the code fix for the problem that GC log
   file name
   will be appended with server name even if user do not choose the
   GC log
   redirect check box during DC configuration.
   
   3. The GC log settings exist in the generic JVM arguments before
   the DC
   configure will not be removed by configurator by design as
   configurator
   will take it as the customer customized option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  CONFIGURING MULTIPLE JVMS EITHER THROUGH GUI OR SILENT INSTALL
   APPENDS MULTIPLE JVM NAMES TO GC_LOG_PATH
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is fixed by FP4
