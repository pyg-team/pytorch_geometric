APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When target cryptographic mode is set to values that  would not
   be valid  (because there are settings that  would not be
   working )  moving  to the new mode  is blocked.
   There is   no visible error message when we do this.
   For customer it  looks as if the  change is not accepted at
   all.   The change will add a message to the logs.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An attempt to change the cryptographic mode to FIPS 140-2 Level
   1 may be blocked if the password file contains MD5 Crypt
   entries.  This condition should be noted in the default log to
   indicate that an MD5 password entry is not compliant with FIPS
   140-2 Level 1.
