ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Visual Duplicates of Assemblies after Replication
   .
   Problem Description:
   .
   Data is being replicated between customer and a
   supplier. The supplier will need to add instance
   assemblies to what is being replicated with
   ownership to them. Customer will always retain
   ownership of The PRC and Level one assemblies.
   When the supplier adds a new instance to the level
   2 assembly, with the expand depth set to All
   Duplicates (clones) appear under that newly
   created instance. Theses duplicates are not found
   in the database, or in the database count
   .
   Scenario:
   .
   On Source Site
   Create New Root
   Insert New Product Root Class
   Save
   .
   Create New Assembly Instance (Level 1)
   Create New Assembly Instance (Level 2)
   Create New Assembly Instance (Level 3)
   Insert New Instance (Detail) under Level 3
   Assembly
   Send To CATIA As Assembly
   Add Documents in CATIA V5 (to the detail
   instance).
   .
   Select PRC and Send to External Site
   Name the Package
   Choose Capture Mode "With Product Class Path"
   .
   Choose target site
   Select Replicate once
   Select Simulate click ok
   View The simulation
   Un-Check Simulate
   Click OK
   .
   Select PRC and Send to External Site
   Name the Package
   Choose Capture Mode "Subassembly"
   Choose target site
   Select Replicate once
   Select Simulate click ok
   View The simulation
   Un-Check Simulate
   Click OK
   .
   Extract The Packages from source site  in INCR
   mode
   Apply the CaptureFile to target site
   Apply Acknowledgement  to source site
   Verify that the target  site has the PRC and
   children
   .
   On Source Site
   Multi Select The level 2 Assembly and all below it
   Send to External Sites
   Name the Package
   Choose Capture Mode "Selected Object Only"
   .
   Choose target site
   Select Replicate once
   Select Transfer with Ownership
   Select Simulate click ok
   View The simulation
   Un-Check Simulate
   Click OK
   .
   Extract The Package from source site
   Apply The Package to target site
   Apply Acknowledgement  to source site
   Verify that the target site has the Ownership
   of the Level 2 assembly and below
   .
   On Target site Open PRC
   Refresh
   Close/minimize the level 1 assembly
   Change expand depth to all
   Expand all on PRC
   Lock level 2 Assembly
   Insert new assembly under the Level 2 Assembly
   .
   Refresh
   Expand on the newly created instance
   .
   Results:
   When expanding the newly created instance
   (with expand depth set to ALL), clones seem to
   appear below the structure. These do not seem
   to be newly created instances, rather
   duplicates/similar from the original data being
   placed in this instance
   .
   Issue:
   These clones are causing disruption within the
   product structure. Instances are in being viewed
   in wrong places. This is causing confusion to the
   supplier and customer. The supplier will be creating
   several instances, and this behavior could and will
   cause disruptions within the PRC and assemblies
   that can lead to a halt in production.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON ENOVIA
   VERSION 5 RELEASE 19 GA LEVEL.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED
   ON V5R18SP05 AND ON V5R17SP08
   Data in the RDBIDENTIFIER table is replicated
   with the corresponding VPMItemInstances.
