APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is seeing a performance degradation in test environment
   when comparing TAM6.0 & TAM4.1. Both the 4.1 and 6.0
   environments are running on the same hardware, same operating
   system(AIX 5.3), maintenance level (5300-05-04) and are being
   tested by the same client.
   
   In the 6.0 SSL handshake there is a gap between the server
   sending the 'change cipher sec' (indicating that client and
   server have agreed on the cipher to be used) and the Encrypted
   Handshake message.
   
   With 4.1, the Encrypted Handshake Message from WebSEAL
   immediately follows the Change Cipher Spec message, without
   waiting for an ACK from the client.
   
   The issue was resolved by using the [ssl] neg-delay-fix-disable
   = true hidden/undocumented option in TAM6.0 Webseal. Customer
   would like the option documented to prove that the
   option is supported in the product.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  [ssl] neg-delay-fix-disable = true hidden setting in Webseal
   conf file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Performance degradation after upgrading from We
   bSEAL 4.1 to 6.0.  In the 6.0 SSL handshake there is a gap betwe
   en the server sending the 'change cipher sec' (indicating that c
   lient and server have agreed on the cipher to be used) and the E
   ncrypted Handshake message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is expected to be cont
   ained in the following maintenance delivery vehicle:
