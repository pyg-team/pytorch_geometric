   ABSTRACT:
   Resolve OpenSSL vulnerability with Online Certificate Status
   Protocol (OCSP): CVE-2016-6304
   
   PACKAGE CONTENTS:

   (C) base/openssl/cssl.mak
   (C) base/openssl/cryp.mak
   
   Object Only Binaries:

   OTHER BINARIES TO BUILD: NO
   None.
   COMMENTS:
   The OpenSSL community recently identified a vulnerability that
   affects the z/TPF OpenSSL version 1.0.2e. The vulnerability can
   occur when a malicious client sends large OCSP Status Request
   extensions. If that client continually requests renegotiation,
   sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then
   there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This can
   eventually result in a Denial of Service attack caused by
   memory depletion.
   Even though the z/TPF system does not support OCSP, the
   vulnerability is still possible.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
   The CRYP and CSSL makefiles have been updated to enable the
   OPENSSL_NO_OCSP compiler option. With the compiler option set,
   the z/TPF system is no longer affected by the vulnerability
   desribed in CVE-2016-6304.
   
   COREQS: NO
   None.
   
   MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS: NO
   None.
   
   BUILD COMMANDS AND INSTRUCTIONS: YES
   #maketpf commands for linux
   maketpf -f CRYP
