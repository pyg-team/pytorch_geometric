You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  What should be done is to use version attribute from
   ObjectName in case we can't parse version info as we do now. I
   don't see any risk in that, in the worst case we end up where we
   are now. In the next version of ITCAM we should consider to use
   version attribute only in case it is present in all WAS
   versions (by Andrey B.).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This workaround is to be applied to
   <DCHOME>/config_dc/getTopology.jacl
   and configDataCollector.jacl. Fix parseVersionInfo in both
   jacls.
   
   e.g.
   
   
    9 proc parseVersionInfo {versionInfo} {
    10   set index1 [string last "IBM WebSphere Application
                                  Server"
                     $versionInfo]
    11   if {$index1 == -1} {
    12     puts "Can't get versionInfo"
    13     return ""  ---> Change this to return "6.1.0.1"
    14   }
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  problem parsing version info
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  fixed in FP3
