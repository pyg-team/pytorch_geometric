QUESTION
 How can I rename default user (typically tipadmin) selected during the installation of Tivoli Integrated Portal? 

CAUSE
TIP allows users to configure multiple user repositories in Federated repositories. You can not have same user Id in more than one repository. If you do then you may not be able to login to TIP using that user Id (however there is a way to add filters to over come this issue). 
Since you can not have same user Id in multiple repositories so you may want to rename default user (created in file based repository) to a different user Id. For instance; you selected a user Id (say tipadmin) during the installation. Later on you configured an LDAP repository in TIP and find out that LDAP repository have same user Id (tipadmin). Now you can't login to TIP using this user Id. Therefore you must delete this user Id from LDAP repository or rename it in file based repository. If you must keep this user Id in LDAP repository then you can rename it in file based repository to keep unique Id across repositories. 


ANSWER
Suppose we want to rename tipadmin to wasuser. Please follow below steps to accomplish this. 


1. Remove LDAP from TIP temporarily. You do not need to do this step if you can login to TIP using tipadmin.
2. Login with tipadmin (who is the admin user and available in file based repository) . 
3 Using Manage Users panel create a new user Id (say wasuser)
4. Assign iscadmins and any other roles needed for wasuser id and save it. 
5. Logout and then Login as wasuser and go to Manage Users panel and delete tipadmin id.
6. Make a backup copy of <TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/security.xml
7. Edit security.xml file and change tipadmin to wasuser in this file.
8. After this add the LDAP back into Federated repositories, if it was removed in step #1.
9. Restart TIP.
