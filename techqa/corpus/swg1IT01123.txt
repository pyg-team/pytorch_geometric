APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JMS object with 2 endpoints (both in the same cluster). While
   the first endpoint is not available, DataPower continues to try
   to connect and does not fail-over to the second endpoint.
   
   SCENARIO:
   -  2 JMS Endpoints Configured:
      endpoint "jms1"
      endpoint "jms2"
   
   - Bring both endpoints down so that neither are available.
   
   - Bring only endpoint "jms2" back up.
   
   RESULTS:
   DataPower continues to try to connect to "jms1" without
   failing-over to "jms2".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are Datapower configurations having WebSphere JMS with
   more than one endpoint specified.  When one of endpoints is not
   reachable, WebSphere JMS will not be able to failover to the
   next one.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.16, 6.0.0.8, 6.0.1.4 and 7.0.0.0.
