Title: IBM Allowing Only SSL Remote 5250 Console Connections - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 HMC Version 8 and later has a configuration option that allows the administrator to restrict remote 5250 console sessions to SSL only. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
HMC Version 8 Release 8.1 and later 

HMC Version 8 Release 8.1 and later allows administrators to disable non-secure remote 5250 console connections. This includes disabling non-SSL (port 2300) connections as well as many weak and medium strength cipher used by default for SSL connections (port 2301). Ciphers not compliant with NIST SP 800-131A (National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-131A) can be disabled by setting the HMC security settings to nist_sp800_131a mode. 

Note: This security mode applies to most servers on the HMC, not just the remote 5250 console. See the HMC release notes (readme.txt) for further release specific information before enabling.

To enable NIST compliant ciphers on the HMC use the command:
chhmc -c security -s modify --mode nist_sp800_131a

Then reboot the hmc: 
hmcshutdown -r -t now

Version 7 and earlier
Versions of the HMC prior to Version 8 do not have a configuration option that allows remote 5250 remote console connections to be restricted to SSL only. The same HMC 5250 proxy firewall setting applies to both SSL and non-SSL connections. 

A circumvention is to block both 2300 and 2301 on the HMC remote interface (typically eth1) then use ssh to perform the encryption by connecting a ssh tunnel to loopback on the HMC.
For example:
- Connect a ssh session to the HMC with a port forward from an unused local port (30000 in the example) to loopback (127.0.0.1), port 2300.
putty tunnel [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015690&amp;aid=1]

- Connect the emulator session to the host/port with the ssh tunnel session.
For IBM Access for Windows use the default userid of Q#HMC as well.
