RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The FileNet Content Engine Version 5.x Hardware and Software Requirements Guide notes that Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers an optional install scenario that does not include the X.org package. The X.org package contains libraries (in addition to other RHEL dependencies) that are required to run the P8 GUI installers. To work around this dependency, use either of the following approaches. One of the approaches is to download and install the following minimum versions of the packages that are available on the original system media. 

What is provided in the guide is only a sample. For Red Hat Linux 5.8, the following packages are required:

libXtst-1.0.1-3.1.i386 
libXpm-3.5.5-3.i386 
compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-69 
compat-db-4.6.21-15 
libXp-1.0.0-15.1 
libXmu-1.0.5-1 
libXtst-1.0.99.2-3 
pam-1.1.1-4 
libXft-2.1.13-4.1 
gtk2-2.18.9-4 
gtk2-engines-2.18.4-5
