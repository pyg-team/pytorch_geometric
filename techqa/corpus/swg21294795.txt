PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to run a job with batch logging on for a VSAM file. You receive message DWW280I CICSVR failed processing batch logging request: CONNECT ... Return code (HEX): 00000008 Reason code (HEX): 71725319 (RC8 RSN71725319). This was followed by DWW252I attempt to connect to CICSVR address space failed. 

SYMPTOM
The complete message text for DWW280I was:


DWW280I CICSVR FAILED PROCESSING 245
BATCH LOGGING REQUEST: CONNECT
FROM ASID: 0035 JOB: JOB050 STEP: JOB0025
FOR SPHERE: FILEVK.COMM.FILE
LOG STREAM
RETURN CODE (HEX): 00000008 
REASON CODE (HEX): 71725319 
PROBLEM DETERMINATION: DUPLICATE REQUEST


CAUSE
There was an attempt to open a VSAM file (sphere) for logging while another job was already using the VSAM file. The other job already opened the VSAM file for update processing, thus creating a situation for a duplicate request.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
As documented in the explanation of message DWW252I [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwmd/kw00469.html], see the probdet2 field description of the associated VSAM IEX161I 002 message for details (CICS VR return and reason codes in non-CICS VR messages).

In this case, the IEC161I message in the job log contains the following RC and RSN information from the CICSVR logger:

IEC161I 002(00000024 717053CB 00000008 71725319)

The reason code 71725319 internally equates to the following:
x'71' = DFSMS subcomponent ARSC_ID_RCC, the RCC subcomponent is CICSVR 

x'72' = Module ID, DWW3GCON_ID, for CICSVR server Logstream Connect 
x'5319' = DWW3GBLC_DuplSphereFailure 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that no parallel updates for the sphere or real were attempted from two different jobs.
