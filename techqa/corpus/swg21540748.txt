PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 YCS : All versions : FedEx server will pass zero freight charge to DCS 

SYMPTOM
If the FedEx server can't find a rate or zone it will simply return a zero freight charge and no error message. This is mostly due to the fact FedEx changed rates on their side but the FedEx server doesn't have them yet. 

Be aware the input XML will look perfect, it will contain all the correct information, however if the Fed server can't find a rate or zone it will send back the reply buffer without error but you will notice it does not send a field 34,35,36,37 or 60 in the xml reply buffer. This might be a clue if you start troubleshooting a zero freight charge problem.

PART: Manifest 6.2 SP2 DCS


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This was happening due to Fedex server rates data was unavailable.
Once downloaded the rates on Fedex Server from FEDEX all scans returned a rate.

A few more notes :
Q Did Fedex server automatically "pulled back / deleted" ALL old rates ?
>>>> That does seem odd. for the past two weeks the people who do the invoicing on the host side, were reporting FedEx freight charges were coming up with zero freight charges.
On April 9th I logged onto the FedEx server and executed a "demand download" for rates. On April 10th, sure enough, no zero freight charges were being passed.
When I spoke to FedEx on the 10th I was still thinking it had to do with something we were passing wrong in the xml. But it was then FedEx said, they could see our rates changed on April 1st, then they could see where I had downloaded them on the 10th. The only guess is that certain rates must carry and expiration date, otherwise I don't see how having old rates would pass back a zero, when you would think it would just pass the old rates. I'll see if I can get an answer from FedEx, but in any case it did seems to behave just as they said. 
New rates were published, our server somehow couldn't find them and passed zero, but after a fresh download things seemed to work.

* How ?

* If very few deleted How do you know these rates were missing ?
>>>> I guess our only sign is that we will start seeing zero freight charges passing out of the FedEx server. This is probably an indication the rate or zone information could not be found. That is how FedEx describes it. Only by passing the 1234 field can you verify and validate the rate and zone is available before requesting the label and tracking number.

* How did you download missing or updated rates?
>>>> On the FedEx server there is an executable to perform a 'demand download'. For rates, tracking numbers and ursa tables. 

* Selective or ALL rates needed to be downloaded
>>>>>I'm guessing it was only selected rates or zones that were updated on April 1st, Otherwise all FedEx cartons would have returned zero freight charge when it was only a few dozen. On the FedEx server we only have the option to demand domestic and international rates.
