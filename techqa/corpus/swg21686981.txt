Title: IBM Error: Unsupported frontend protocol - United States

Text:
Unsupported frontend protocol TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Need to understand where these messages are coming from and why we get them: 

2014-xx-xx xx:xx:xx.xxxxxx EDT [7777] DEBUG: connection failed: host=(null) user=xxx database=xxx error=Unsupported frontend protocol. 

CAUSE
This error only in the socket layer between the hand-shaking of the client and server.
In this case, this error was returned by the old backend due to protocol mismatch. The connection closed by the backend likely due to the newer frontend protocol used. Client and server are unable to communicate using different version of protocol.


ANSWER
You are seeing this in /nz/kit/log/postgres/pg.log, but do not know what it means. 


The message indicates that there are connections from a higher protocol version (for example, higher version driver is trying to connect to database with lower version.) that the backend cannot recognise.

Since the protocol is unknown, we don't actually know where the IP is coming from. You may want to contact IBM Support if you are seeing a lot of these messages; we need to find other way to track down the Client IP responsible for this and stop it before it is generating too many fail connection attempts to the server.

Some network tools like tcpdump can be useful to track down the client IP. We will then check if the driver version is too new.

Upgrading the database version (backend) to the latest is another possible solution.
