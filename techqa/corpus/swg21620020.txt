PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unexplained SVC dumps captured after WebSphere MQ (WMQ) queue manager migration 

SYMPTOM
Symptom strings similar to the following are generated in the joblog

IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED: 
DUMPID=018 REQUESTED BY JOB (batch job name) 
DUMP TITLE=abcd,ABN=0C4-00000011,U=, 

C=R3600.710.SSSC-CSQ3CL0X,M=CSQ3CL0X,PSW=psw_address,ASID=asid 


CAUSE
Similar abends can occur if an older version of the batch adapter is being picked up (since this means older levels of the code for CSQBCON and/or CSQBSRV are being loaded from the older SCSQAUTH dataset). 

The problem will only occur if an application TCB ends without issuing an MQDISC. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change your job(s) to use the version of the SCSQAUTH dataset load modules which are current for the level of WebSphere MQ to which you have migrated.
