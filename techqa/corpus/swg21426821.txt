PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS), CICS initialization fails with DFHAP0701 abend 0C4/AKEA in exit program TX1FCSRC and DFHSR0601 Program interrupt with system task III in control . You are running ASG-TMON for CICS TS exit program TM1N680. 

SYMPTOM
 The console (IPCS MTrace) contains the following messages:

DFHSI8424I Control returned from PLT [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMGV_3.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfht2/topics/dfht2c00150.html]programs during the second stage of initialization.
DFHAP0701 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMGV_3.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0701.html] An abend (code 0C4/AKEA [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMGV_3.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/AKxx_abend_codes/AKEA.html]) has occurred in exit program TX1FCSRC at exit point XFCSREQC.
DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control. 

Note: This was originally seen in CICS TS V3.2.


CAUSE
You have re-assembled the DFHPLTPI without making necessary changes to the ASG-TMON for CICS TS entries. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Program list table (DFHPLTPI) shows program TM1N680 being run in the second stage, and this module enabled the exit program TX1FCSRC for exit XFCSREQC.

The program check (abend0C4) occurs in TM1N965 (ASM 04/20/09 10.12 VERSION 032 MOD LEVEL 0000-020), offset x'1EC'. Failing instruction is 58F01000 with Reg1=7FFFF000 .



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove user exit program TM1N680 from your startup PLTPI table, and restart CICS. If you need this exit enabled, contact ASG [http://www.asg.com] for further assistance with ASG-TMON for CICS TS.
