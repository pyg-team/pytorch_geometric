   TEXT READS:
   When adding attributes to your user repository for example
   adding attributes to your property extension database or when
   adapting attributes to match your LDAP server(s) with your
   business needs, you may have added an attribute name incorrectly
   or if an attribute was already added due to migration and is
   causing problems, you can remove the attribute from the
   database. After you remove the attribute, you can run the
   wp-add-la-property task that is described in the Configuring a
   property extension database file.
   Prerequisites
   - Querying the defined attributes on AIX
   - Adding attributes
   - Mapping attributes
   Perform the following steps to remove an attribute from your
   database:
   Important: Do not remove attributes that have already been
   populated with user values because this can cause database
   inconsistencies.
   Cluster note: In a clustered environment, perform the following
   steps on the deployment manager and then resynch the nodes.
   1. Open the tool you use to edit your database.
   2. Verify that your attribute name is available in the LAPROP
   table.
   3. Delete the required attributes from the LAPROP table.
   4. Open the wimxmlextension.xml file, located in the
   wp_profile_root/config/cells/cellname/wim/model directory.
   5. Locate and delete the propertySchema definition for the
   attributes that you deleted from the LAPROP table; for example:
       <wim:propertySchema nsURI="http://www.ibm.com/websphere/wim"
   dataType="String"
           multiValued="true" propertyName="attribute_name">
   
   <wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>PersonAccount</wim:applicableEnti
   tyTypeNames>
       </wim:propertySchema>
   6. Save your changes to the wimxmlextension.xml file.
   7. Open the wimconfig.xml file, located in the
   wp_profile_root/config/cells/cellname/wim/config directory.
   8. Locate and delete the propertiesNotSupported definitions for
   the attributes that you deleted from the LAPROP table; for
   example:
   <config:propertiesNotSupported name="attribute_name">
   9. Save your changes to the wimconfig.xml file.
   10. Stop and restart the server1 and WebSphere_Portal servers
   from the wp_profile_root/bin directory.
