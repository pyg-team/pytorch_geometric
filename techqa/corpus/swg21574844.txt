QUESTION
 Where can I find IBM FileNet IDM Desktop (IDM DT) sample code in version 4.0.3? 

CAUSE
With IDM 4.0.3 onward, the sample code is no longer bundled with the installer. The developer option is presented during the installation process, but it only installs the IDM Desktop/Web Services Developer Help file, not the sample code as previous versions of IDM DT did.

ANSWER
The sample code had been posted here:
