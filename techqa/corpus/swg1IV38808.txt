LOCAL FIX
 *  Copy the ITM CD-ROM LAP_LIC directory to the target machine's
   installation image directory, and retry the installation
   locally.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable to install Universal Agent via Tivoli Configuration
   Manager or Tivoli Provisioning Manager using exported custom
   Software Package Definition (SPD) file.
   
   
   When using tacmd exportBundles to create a custom Universal
   Agent SPD file, the resultant Universal Agent SPD file fails to
   install.  Specifying SPD exports a Software Package Definition
   (SPD) file and other accompanying agent files so that Tivoli
   Configuration Manager (TCM) or Tivoli Provisioning Manager (TPM)
   can be used to remotely install the agent.
   
   For example, given a Universal Agent SPD file for Windows is
   named UM_062301000_WINNT,
   attempting to install from UM_062301000_WINNT produces the
   following message dialog:
   
   "Licensing initialization error, incorrect initialization
   information found."
   
   installation failed with the following messages in the Abort
   file:
   03-07-2013 05:44:49: License file D:\UM_062~1\LAP_LIC\LA_en does
   not exist, License program may fail.

   be deleted.
                        ERROR: The system cannot find the file
   specified.
   
   The installation failure is occurring because certain
   accompanying files, namely LAP_LIC\LA_en, LAP_LIC\LA_cs,
   LAP_LIC\LA_de,etc.  are missing from
   KUM<interp>.dsc files and thus, these files are missing from
   tacmd produced export bundle.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Universal Agent specific 'packaging' files, used in process
   of creating CD-ROM images, were updated to include the
   collection of LAP_LIC/LA_* files.
