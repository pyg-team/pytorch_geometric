QUESTION
 Collecting data for problems with ILOG JRules Rule Execution Server component. Collecting this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

ANSWER
You can use the Rule Execution Server Console to monitor execution traces from Decision Warehouse, test ruleset execution in Diagnostics, manage ruleapps, rulesets, and transparent decision services, and retrieve server information. 

If you have not already contacted support, proceed with Collecting Data: Read first for all ILOG Business Rule Management Systems Components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21423343]. Otherwise collect the following ILOG Rule Execution Server data:
