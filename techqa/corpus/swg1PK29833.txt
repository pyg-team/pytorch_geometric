APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "cxlinuxgnu/test_aug.c:Tp.h No such file or directory" message
   appears when compiling.
   The customer's remote TDP directory is: /opt/targets/cxlinuxgnu
   and they mounted it to a local mount point as:
   /opt/nfsmount_tdpdir. It seems that TestRT does not access files
   in remote machine.
   
   We have analysed TDP and in remoteUtils.pl, and we assume that
   it should be revised like shown below:
   - From -
   <<<
   
    my $remote_command =  $remote_shell . " cd $remote_cwd; ";
   
    $remote_command .= $command;
   
    ##$remote_command .= "; echo \"status=\$?\" > $log 2>&1";
   
    $remote_command .= "; echo \"status=\$?\" > $log";
   
   >>>
   
   
   
   - to -
   
   <<<
   
    my $remote_command =  $remote_shell . "\" cd $remote_cwd; ";
   
    $remote_command .= $command;
   
    ##$remote_command .= "; echo \"status=\$?\" > $log 2>&1";
   
    $remote_command .= "; echo \"status=\$?\" > $log\"";
   
   >>>
