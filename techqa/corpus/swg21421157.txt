QUESTION
 How do you silently install IBM Rational Synergy client for a patch release on Microsoft Windows? 

CAUSE
You want an unaided install.

ANSWER
To perform Rational Synergy fix-pack silent installation, a response file would be required, which contains the information required for the installation. The response file can be created by doing a manual installation once in record mode. Below are the steps to create the response file. 

Copy Rational Synergy fix-pack installer from Rational Synergy Server to the machine where the fix-pack needs to be installed.
The following URL can be used to download Rational Synergy fix-pack installer from Rational Synergy server: "http://<synergy_server_hostname>:<server_port>/client". Alternatively, you can copy the installer file from Rational Synergy server run-area through FTP. The installer file can be found under path "$CCM_HOME/client/".
The fix-pack installer file shall be named as “Update_<release_tag>.exe”. For example, Rational Synergy fix pack 7.2.1.3, shall have the installer file name as “Update_7.2-1.3.exe”.

Extract files from Rational Synergy fix-pack installer.
Rational Synergy fix-pack installers are self extracting executable files. When you attempt to install a fix-pack a bunch of files shall be extracted to the current system’s temporary path. Those extracted files are required to perform silent installation. Below are the steps to get the extracted files from the installer:


 1. Open a WINDOWS command prompt and set both the environment variables “temp” and ”tmp” to a preferred path, where you want to extract the files. (For example, "set temp=c:\synergy_installer")
    
    
 2. Execute the installer from the command prompt window. Before the installation window opens, the files will be extracted to the above mentioned temporary path.
    
    
 3. Copy the folder with name “TLogSynergyInstall” from the temporary path to a path which can be accessible from all other machines where the fix-pack needs to be installed.
    
    
 4. Cancel the installation.


Create response file.  1. Open a WINDOWS command prompt and get into the folder “TLogSynergyInstall”. (Assume the path is “C:\TLogSynergyInstall\”)
    
    
 2. Execute the following command: "setup.exe /r /f1C:\TLogSynergyInstall\setup.iss /f2C:\TLogSynergyInstall\setup.log"
    
    
 3. Rational Synergy installation window gets opened. Provide the required input and install the fix-pack. Once the installation is complete, you can see a response file with name "setup.iss" created under the path “C:\TLogSynergyInstall\”.


Now the response file has been created. Silent installation of the fix-pack can be done on any client machines using this response file and the extracted files. 

Silent Installation.  1. Make sure the directory “TLogSynergyInstall”, is accessible from the client machines where the fix-pack needs to be installed. Make sure the response file is present in the same directory.
    
    
 2. Set CCM_HOME to the Rational Synergy client's home directory. E.g.:
    set CCM_HOME=C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\Synergy\7.2.1
    
    
 3. Open a WINDOWS command prompt and get into the “TLogSynergyInstall” directory. 
    
    
 4. Execute the command “setup.exe /s”. This shall install Rational Synergy fix-pack on the client machine without any user intervention.



Generate install logs: 
By default the install log file shall be generated under the current directory (that is, under "TLogSynergyInstall" folder) and the file name would be "setup.log". The users can also specify the log file with the option "/f2" while executing the command. 

For example, "setup.exe /s /f2C:\Rational\Synergy\install.log". Note that there are no space between the option (/f2) and the path (C:\Rational\Synergy\install.log).
