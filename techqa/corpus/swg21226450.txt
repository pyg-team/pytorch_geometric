PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA (CICS TS) region receives message DFHSO0001 with an abend code 0C4 AKEA (abend0C4 abendAKEA) at offset X'FFFF' in DFHSOIS. This happens every 3 hours when statistics are taken. It happens only when security is active, for example when using the basic security manager (BSM) supplied by z/VSE. 

SYMPTOM
DFHSO0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'FFFF' in module DFHSOIS


CAUSE
All transactions used by Web Support are not defined within the BSM.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add transactions CWBG CSOL and CSOX to the BSM with SEC LEVEL 1.

In this case, CSOL and CWBG were defined, but CSOX was completely missing in BSM. Adding CSOX with Sec Level 1 to BSM solved the problem.
