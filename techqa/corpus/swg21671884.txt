Title: IBM Known Issue with Optim Data Growth Solution for Oracle E-Business: Unable to run reports using the Archive and combined responsibilities - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to run any reports using the Archive and combined responsibilities for any module. This problem occurs in Oracle E-Business v12.2 and later versions if your database version is 11gR2 or later. 

SYMPTOM
The reports fail without creating a file, and the log file displays the following error:


APPLLCSP Environment Variable set to:
Current NLS_LANG and NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS Environment Variables are:
American_America.AL32UTF8
'.,'
Enter Password: 
Enter Password: 
Enter Password: 
REP-0167: Database connect strings are not permitted in USERID parameter. Use TNSnames alias to specify the database.
REP-0501: Unable to connect to the specified database.
ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
REP-0501: Unable to connect to the specified database.
ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
REP-0309: Unable to connect to the specified database after three attempts. Access denied.


CAUSE
This problem is a result of Oracle dropping support for the Oracle- Register- users window. 

For more information about this issue, see ORACLE Users Window in the Oracle documentation at the following site: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26401_01/doc.122/e22954.pdf [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26401_01/doc.122/e22954.pdf] 

This problem is seen only with Oracle reports. Oracle forms works well with the Archive and combined responsibilities.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Do the following to resolve this problem.


 1.  Login to the machine on which the Oracle E-Business application is installed (along with the database) using the putty login as the Oracle user.
 2.  
 3.  Navigate to <ORACLE_HOME> path, for example: cd /u01/oracle/VIS/11.2.0
 4.  
 5.  Source the environment variable, for example: VIS_ebsr170.env
 6.  
 7.  Type sqlplus and press Enter. When prompted for a user name, type sysdba and press Enter to connect to sql.
 8.  
 9.  Type SHOW PARAMETER SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON and press Enter.
      * If the parameter is set to True, case sensitivity is enabled for the database. No action is required, and you can go to step 8.
      * If the parameter is set to False, change the value to True.
      * 
     
     
 10. 
 11. Type ALTER SYSTEM SET SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON = TRUE; and press Enter.
 12. 
 13. Re-enter SHOW PARAMETER SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON and press Enter to verify that the value is changed to True.
 14. 
 15. Log in to the same machine as the applmgr user, and navigate to $APPL_TOP. For example: cd /u01/applmgr/VIS/fs1/EBSapps/appl
 16. 
 17. Source the environment variable. For example, APPSVIS_ebsr170.env
 18. 
 19. Navigate to the admin folder under the path shown in step 8.
 20. 
 21. Source the environment variable. For example, adovars.env
 22. 
 23. Type FNDCPASS APPS/APPS 0 Y system/manager ORACLE PSTARCH PSTARCH and press Enter.
 24. 
 25. Restart the concurrent manager by doing the following:
 26. 
 27.  Log in to the machine as the applmgr user. 
     Navigate to the scripts folder where you can start/stop the E-Business application and services, such as concurrent managers and press Enter.
     
     Example: cd /u01/applmgr/VIS/fs1/inst/apps/VIS_ebsr170/admin/scripts 
     Type ./adcmctl.sh stop APPS/APPS. The output must return a 0 status. 
     Wait until the concurrent manager is shut down completely. You can check this by navigating to Concurrent > Manager > Administer using the System Administrator Responsibility. The Actual and Target columns must be 0 for all services. 
     After the concurrent manager shuts down, restart it. 
     Type ./adcmctl.sh start APPS/APPS and press Enter. The output must return a 0 status. 
     You can check the status of the concurrent manager again as described in d. The Actual and Target columns must be 1 for all services. 
     
 28. Disable case sensitivity Log-on. If you skipped step 6, you can skip this step, too. (If step 6 was skipped, it indicates that case sensitivity log-on is enabled in the database by default.)If you did step 6, type ALTER SYSTEM SET SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON = FALSE; and press Enter.
     
     Now, if you run the reports using the Archive and combined responsibilities, the request can be completed normally (Completed/Normal).
