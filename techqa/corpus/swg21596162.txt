PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to determine if certain events are actually being captured by the EventReader? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Putting the EventReader in debug enables the EventReader debug logging to capture the Serial and StateChange value of every event captured. This requires an additional property in the ImpactServer properties file: 

 * 
 * 


to capture the Serial and StateChange of all events captured by the EventReader(s): 

 * 


This will require an ImpactServer restart to enable and you will then see the additional log statements of the format: 

 * 


Where [DateTimeStamp] is the date and time the log message was recorded in the format: 

 * 


This is in the log files for your EventReader Services: 

 * 



Or, for Impact 6 & 7: 

 * 


Where [ImpactServerName] is the name of the ImpactServer (for example: NCI) and [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader Service producing this output (for example: omnibuseventreader) and (.n) are the numbered roll-over log files (between 1 and 10 by default). 

Please also ensure that the EventReader is configured to log to file - for example:
