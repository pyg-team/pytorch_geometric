Title: IBM Unable to execute any Modeler stream using SPSS Deployment Manager - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Any attempts to execute a job containing a Modeler stream job step results in an error:

"Error executing Job <jobname>" 

SYMPTOM
Any Modeler stream being executed is stopped with an error. Error only occurs when stream is executed through IBM SPSS C&DS Deployment Manager.

CDS.LOG file contains:
2013-08-30 09:15:22,328 ERROR

Executing the same stream using SPSS Modeler Client/Server produced no errors. 
Executing a General Job step in Deployment Manager did not produce any problems. 



CAUSE
Incorrect use of Java JRE and JBoss installation folder.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows Server 2008 R2

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using 'engine.log' file from C&DS, found the Java being used with the Repository Configuration utility was incorrect. It was pointing to:
<install>\Java6.0\JRE.

Also using 'engine.log', found installation folder of JBoss to be non-default. JBoss was extracted to:
C:\jboss-6





Reviewing 'options.cfg' of Modeler Server shows that COP (Coordination of Processes) is disabled. Modeler Server is not installed as a cluster configuration.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-extracted JBoss to its default location on the C:\ drive:
C:\jboss-6.0.0.Final

Java JRE during Repository Configuration was set to:
<install>\Java6.0\JDK\JRE
