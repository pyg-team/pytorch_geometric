APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An issue arises where there are custom classes for PZN rules
   included in the paa file. When the paa file is deployed on
   secondary nodes, the jar files are not being copied across to
   the location required. This is due to the unless="isSecondNode"
   attribute on the action-create-personalisation-rules-applySIFeat
   urePack-components/componentName task. This attribute is
   necessary to ensure that the .nodes files are not uploaded on
   the secondary nodes. However, as the same task handles both the
   copying of the jar files and the .nodes file upload, this
   results in the jar files not being copied.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 06 (PI36060 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI36060]) for Portal
   8.5.0.0 available from Fix Central:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix splits the functionality into 2 tasks for the jar file
   copy and the .nodes upload. Both of these tasks will be called
   from the action-create-personalisation-rules-applySIFeaturePack-
   components/component name task with only the .nodes upload task
   with the unless="isSecondNode" attribute set.
