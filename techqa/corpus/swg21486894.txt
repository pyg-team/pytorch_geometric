Title: IBM Macintosh Installer not responding OS 10.5.8 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to install PASW Statistics v.18.x on a Macintosh OS 10.5.8 or OS 10.6.2 and after the installer appears very briefly in your dock, it then disappears without installing. You attempted to drag the installer .app to the Applications directory and run from there but saw the same results. You would like to install the application. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You should follow these steps:

1. From the Finder, navigate to the PASW_Statistics_Installer.app
2. Context menu click on the app icon and select "Show Package Contents"
3. In the resulting Finder window, click on the "Contents" folder, then the "MacOS" folder
4. Double click on the app bundle "PASW_Statistics_Installer" and the Statistics installer should run.
5. Follow the onscreen prompts as usual
