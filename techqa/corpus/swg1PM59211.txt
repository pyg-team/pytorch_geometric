ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You installed AMOS 19 or 20 on a Windows computer as
   Administrator. However, when a restricted user with only read
   permissions on C:\ or C:\Program files they get an access denied
   message about a folder with path c:\garb\cache.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. As a workaround
   create this folder as administrator manually for
   the user with limited permissions.
