ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SUMMARY:
   Web Console for IBM Information Server sessions will timeout out
   when the WAS security cache timeout is exeeded.
   
   DETAILS:
   In a  Web Console for IBM Information Server session, the
   session will timeout after a period of inactivity.
   
   The default is 10 minutes.
   
   There are thre properties that affect sessions timeouts:
   1)  The Web Console for IBM Information Server
       - Global Session Properties Timeout
   
   2)  The Websphere Application Server
       - Session Properties Timeout
   
   3)  The Websphere Application Server
       - Security Cache Timeout
   
   The default values for these are:
      1) 1800 seconds
      2)   30 minutes
      3)  600 seconds
   
   So, it is possible that even though the Global Session
   Properties Timeout(1) is increased, the Web Console session will
   still time out.
   
   Therefore, all 3 properties must have at least the same values.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are three timeout properties that require to be set.
   
   1)  The Web console Global Session Properties Timeout
   
       This is found under the
       Adminsitration Tab ->  Session Management -> Active Sessions
       screen.
   
       The Global Session Property is:
   
       "Inactive Session Timeout"
   
   2)  The Websphere Application Server Session Properties Timeout
   
       Using the Websphere Adminstrative Console this property can
       be found under the Servers -> Application Servers screen.
   
       eg: http://iishost:9060/ibm/console [http://iishost:9060/ibm/console]
           User ID:  WAS Admin userid created at time of
                     installation
           Password: WAS Admin password.
   
       Servers [+]
          Application Servers [+]
                server1  (this is a URL, click to see settings)
   
          Container Setting [+] ( click to expand )
                Web Container Settings
                    Session Management
   
          Session Timeout
                Set Timeout
                          720 minutes (NOTE: This is in minutes)
   
   
   3)  The Websphere Application Server Security Cache Timeout
   
       Using the Websphere Adminstrative Console this property can
       be found under the Security -> Global Security screen.
   
       eg: http://iishost:9060/ibm/console [http://iishost:9060/ibm/console]
           User ID:  WAS Admin userid created at time of
                     installation
           Password: WAS Admin password.
   
       Security [+]
          Global security [+]
   
          Configuration -> General Properties
   
            Cache timeout  (NOTE: this is in seconds, default 600).
   
   
   
   Ensure that the Websphere Application Server timeout values are
   greater than or equal to the Inactive Session Timeout set in the
   Web Console for IBM Information Server.
   
   Example:
      If we want to have an Inactive Session Timeout of 6 hours,
   then we need to have the following settings:
   
   1) "Inactive Sesson Timeout" = 21600 seconds
   
   2) "Session timeout"         =   366 minutes
   
   3) "Cache timeout"           = 21660 seconds
   
   Once the changes have been made to the Websphere Application
   Server, the WAS server1 must be restarted.
