QUESTION
 Can you run backupConfig.sh from and existing Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) instance and restore it on a completely new installation of TDWC with restoreConfig.sh? 

CAUSE
Restoring settings from an existing TDWC instance would cut down on set up time for future instances.

1. If you run the backupConfig.sh command and do a complete reinstallation of TDWC, can you just run the restoreConfig.sh? If so, will all changes (customizations) made to WebSphere Administration Console, such as configuring LDAP, be restored to the new instance? Also will all changes made to the Dashboard (user roles, etc) be restored?

2. If I install TDWC v9.2, can backupConfig.sh be run on TDWC v9.1 and then can restoreConfig.sh be run on TDWC v9.2 so you do not have to configure everything again?


ANSWER
To perform a complete backup / restore of the TDWC, perform the following: 


BACKUP PHASE:
1. backup WebSphere settings: use the backupConfig wastool (a zip file is created in the wastool folder) 

2. backup JazzSM settings: use the tipcli command. 

Run tipcli as follows: 


- <JAZZSM_HOME>/ui/bin/tipcli.[bat/sh] Export --username <WASADMIN> --password <WASPWD> --excludePlugins ChartExportPlugin,CmsExportPlugin 


A zip file called data.zip is created in the <JAZZSM_HOME>/ui/output/data.zip 

3. backup TDWC settings: zip the folder <JAZZSM_HOME>/profile/registry

RESTORE PHASE: 

1. restore WebSphere settings: use the restoreConfig wastool 

 - there should be the same paths on the machine
- also this procedure is valid if restoring only from windows to windows or from unix to unix (not unix to windows or windows to unix). 

2. restore JazzSM settings: use the tipcli command as follows: 

 - Copy the data.zip (previously created) in the <JAZZSM_HOME>/ui/input folder.
- Start the WAS profile
- run tipcli as follows: 


<JAZZSM_HOME>/ui/bin/tipcli.[bat/sh] Import --username <WASADMIN> --password <WASPWD> --excludePlugins CmsExportPlugin,ChartExportPlugin 

3. restore TDWC settings: unzip the <registry.zip> previously created in the folder <JAZZSM_HOME>/profile/registry

Answers to questions from the "Cause" field above: 

1. If you reinstall only the TDWC, you can restore the TDWC registry (step 3). If you reinstall also the TDWC software prerequisites, it is necessary to follow the steps above. 

2. If you install on the same machine, you can update the existing instance (from TDWC v9.1. FP01 to TDWC v9.2). Otherwise, you can install the TDWC v9.2 and then follow the steps above to restore the existing settings.
