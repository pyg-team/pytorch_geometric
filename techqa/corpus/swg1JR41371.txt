   Steps to rerproduce:
   1. Create a BPD and expose the Performance Metrics on Overview
   tab.
   2. Update the tracking definitions.
   3. Start the several instances of the BPD.
   4. Login to the Process Portal and switch the locale to Russian
   on the Preferences page.
   5. Navigate to the Process Performance report for the created
   above BPD.
   6. Open Instance Details page by clicking the Instances Chart.
   ===> Date is displayed in U.S. format (mm/dd/yyyy). See the
   attached screenshot.
   
   Expected Result: The date should be displayed in European format
   (dd/mm/yyyy).
   
   Note 1: The issue is reproduced on 7.5.0.1 as well as on 7.5.1.
   Note 2: The issue is reproduced with any other European locale.
   
   From Customer:
   
   We've faced some localization issues with reports.
   In some places in reports there are date only in US format and
   not
   depends on user locale.
   
   For example in Process Performance report, go inside specific
   process,
   then select View All, you will see Due Date, and Remaining
   columns in
   US date format, even if user have Russian locale. (screenshot in
   attachment)
   
   After some investigation we've found several places where date
   formats
   are hard coded:
   
   1) In Process Portal application in PM Process Analysis report
   in page
   code in several places
   2) In database queries in section
   <instance-details-query>/<task-
   details-query> in configuration files.
   
   We need to use Russian date formats in our project.
   Could you please give us some tips on advices how to fix this
   issue.
   
   We use IBM BPM 7.5.0.1.
