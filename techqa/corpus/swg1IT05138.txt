APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In PureApplication System version 2.0.0.0, the deployment of
   System Monitoring Shared Server deployment ends in with an error
    Status condition.  When looking at the Middleware perspective
   section of the System Monitoring shared service panel, the
   "Hub-TEMS" Virtual Machine will have the red error status
   associated with it.
   
   In addition, the following error will be seen in the
   console.log.0 file under the
   /opt/IBM/maestro/agent/usr/servers/ITM-Hub-TEMS.xxx/logs
   directory of the Hub-TEMS MustGather logs.

   timeout, stop installing soa topology support.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Go to "Workload Console->Cloud->Pattern Types" and click on the
   entry under "System Monitoring Support for SOA Pattern Type
   1.0".  From there, on the upper right part of the panel, check
   the "Status" field to see if this is enabled.
   
   If it is enabled and you are not actually monitoring any SOA
   agents (monitoring SOA agents is not common at this time), do
   the following:
   
   1)  Disable this SOA pattern type (again, from the Pattern
   Types" panel)
   2)  Delete the current System Monitoring Shared Service
   3)  Redeploy the System Monitoring Shared Service
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  System Monitoring shared services can fail to deploy if the
   System Monitoring Support for SOA Pattern Type is enabled on
   IBM PureApplication System version 2.0.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being released with IBM PureApplication System
   version 2.0.0.1 so that the System Monitoring services can
   deploy successfully when the System Monitoring Support for SOA
   Pattern Type version 1.0.2.2 is enabled.
