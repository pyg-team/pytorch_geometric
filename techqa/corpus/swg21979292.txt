WMB IIB SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Windows graphical user interface installer (setup.exe) used by WebSphere Message Broker, IBM Integration Bus, IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack, IBM Integration Bus Manufacturing Pack, and IBM Integration Bus Retail Pack, is susceptible to a DLL-planting vulnerability, where a malicious DLL that is present in the Windows search path could be loaded by the operating system in place of the genuine file.



VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-4560 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4560]
DESCRIPTION: Flexera InstallAnywhere could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system, caused by an untrusted search path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability, by using a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory of a setup-launcher executable file, to gain elevated privileges on the system.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Complete these steps to work around the InstallAnywhere vulnerability.

To avoid the untrusted search path vulnerability, where users could gain increased privileges, complete the following steps:
1) Create a new, empty, secure directory in a temporary location.
The directory must not exist previously and only the administrator should have write access to it.
2) Either copy or move the installer executable, or unpack the installation zip file into the new, empty folder created in Step 1.
3) Ensure that there are no DLL files in this directory.
4) Launch the installer executable from its new location.
