APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0.1 or 20.0 installed on
   a Windows 7 64 bit computer.
   On Graphs - Chart Builder you create a dual axis bar chart with
   a categorical x-axis variable and a scale variable on the y-axis
   representing mean summary statistics and count and the dual
   y-axis.
   After you create the chart you edit it on Chart Editor and save
   the changes as chart template file *.sgt.
   You then create a second dual axis bar chart and try to apply
   the template you previously created.
   
   However, after you click on apply template the program shuts
   down without error messages. Upon the program shut down you may
   notice some crash files created on a temporary folder. Their
   names may look like the examples below:
   
   core.20110915.104813.3224.0001.dmp
   javacore.20110915.104813.3224.0003.txt
   Snap.20110915.104813.3224.0002.trc
   
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   It is expected to be resolved with IBM Statistics 19 Fixpack 2
   and IBM SPSS Statistics 20 FixPack 1.
   The program shut down happens only for this chart type on 64
   bit. It dows
   not happen on 32 bit Windows systems.
