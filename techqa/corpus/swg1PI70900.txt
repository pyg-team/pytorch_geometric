APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Collector manager uses internal buffers to store events.
   These buffers are discarded when the last handler goes away.
   This behavior does not doesn't work well for certain
   situations. Example below.
   
   1) We have one handler (logmet/logstash collector feature).
   2) User updates the config for this feature, example bad
   port to a valid port.
   3) Logmet/Logstash collector calls an unsubscribe &
   subscribe on the sources on config update.
   4) Unsubscribe will discard the existing buffers and a
   subscribe operation will result in new buffers getting
   allocated.
   5) End result is we lose events in the old buffer.

   Collector manager uses internal buffers to store events. These
   buffers are discarded when the last handler goes away. This
   behavior is not doesn't work well for certain situations.
   Example below.
   
   1) We have one logmet/logstash collector feature.
   2) User updates the config for this feature, example bad port to
   a valid port.
   3) Logmet/Logstash collector calls a unsubscribe & subscribe on
   the sources on config update.
   4) Unsubscribe will discard the existing buffers and a subscribe
   operation will result in new buffers getting allocated.
   5) End result is that we lose events in the old buffer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Program change: We now maintain the buffer contents across
   configuration changes as long as the source is present both
   before and after the change. If the source is removed, the
   configuration saved, and then the source is added again at a
   later time, the events in between will still be lost, as
   intended.
