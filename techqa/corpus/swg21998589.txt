QUESTION
 Why are the GDE binaries missing after upgrade of AIX OS from version 6.1 to version 7.1? 

ANSWER
You can't use the GDE Agent binaries for AIX version 6.1 on AIX version 7.1. 

If you already did this then you need to: 

- Uninstall the GDE agent. 

- Reboot the server. 

- Install GDE Agent binaries for AIX v7.1 

 

To avoid this problem in the first place do this: 


- On AIX v6.1 uninstall the GDE agent. 
- Upgrade OS to v7.1 during this a reboot will be done. Take note that during OS upgrade file access to encrypted files will not be possible. 
- New install of AIX v7.1 GDE agent.

For details about how to uninstall, and install a GDE Agent. Please refer to your GDE Agent Install Guide.
