Title: IBM Question about Symphony EGO allocation ID - United States

Text:
ego allocation ID; SD_SDK; EGO_ALLOC_NEW; EGO_ALLOC_DONE; EGO_ALLOC_UPDATE; SOAM Consumer TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In what conditions the EGO allocation ID for a SOAM consumer changes? And when is it reused? 

ANSWER

The SOAM consumer allocation ID changes are confirmed through the following test cases: 

Case 1: If SSM pID is killed (crashes) and SSM restarted on same host 

 *  alloc ID does not change new SSM is spawned and previous alloc ID is reused nothing logged in ego.stream file 

Case 2: SSM host is close reclaimed and SSM restarted on different host  *  SD requests a new allocation from EGO, therefore alloc ID is now incremented new SSM is spawned on the new alloc ID EGO_ALLOC_DONE is logged in ego.stream file for the previous alloc ID 

Case 3: SSM restarts on a different host due to recovery [say, when SSM host is powered off]  *  Once EGO detects that the SSM host is "unavailable", SD spawns a new SSM on another Management/SSM host However, the same alloc ID is reused EVENT_ALLOC_UPDATE is logged in ego.stream file for that reused alloc ID 

Case 4: SSM exits because application is re-registered or disabled&enabled.  *  EVENT_ALLOC_DONE is logged in ego.stream file for old alloc ID SD spawns a new SSM on a new alloc ID
