Title: IBM Case Manager solution deployment fails because the XPDL document cannot be validated. - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Deploying a case manager solution fails because a property's symbolic name is not unique. 

CAUSE
The IBM Content Platform Engine does not prevent users from creating property templates that use existing symbolic names when they are created using FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) or via a custom program that comes through its API. The Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) and FileNet Deployment Manager (FDM) applications have built-in client side checks that prevent it. FEM does not. 
Case Manager cannot deploy a solution if properties with the same symbolic_name exist.


ENVIRONMENT
5.2.1



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The solution's Detail Deployment Log contains messages stating that the XPDL document cannot be validated because a solution property is missing. 

10/2/15 10:44:12:896 EDT] 000000f9 api E com.ibm.casemgmt.intgimpl.messages.CaseMgmtLogger error FNRPA0034E The solution cannot be deployed because the validation of the XPDL document failed with the following Process Engine error message:
MTS_Custom:Add RAC DW Extract:[ ERROR ] Parameter TEST_PROPERTY, The property F_CaseFolder.TEST_PROPERTY. does not exist in the CE object. 

Then it reports a uniqueness violation.

2015-10-02T10:26:50.519 BC190B07 ENG FNRCE0043E - ERROR method name: validateSymbolicPropertyName principal name: TF6P Global Transaction: true User Transaction: false Exception Info: A uniqueness requirement has been violated. The symbolic name (test_property) must be unique within the class family (e.g., Document, Folder, CustomObject, etc.) and currently exists on class MTS_CustomClass. Rename the corresponding PropertyTemplate (id={C790088D-24A1-436C-9C88-B9403A6F46E6}) and reattempt the operation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the GUID displayed in the log to find the property template that has the duplicate symbolic name and delete it using ACCE. In the error examples above the GUID is:C790088D-24A1-436C-9C88-B9403A6F46E6. 

To prevent the problem from happening again, do not use FileNet Enterprise Manager to export solution templates from one Case Manager environment and import them into another. Instead use FileNet Deployment Manager.
