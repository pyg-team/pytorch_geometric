Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect WebSphere Process Server (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect some configurations of IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile that is shipped as a component of WebSphere Process Server. The IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server is not affected. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION:The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

 * WebSphere Process Server V7.0 
 * WebSphere Process Server Hypervisor Editions V6.2, V7.0


As previously announced, support for WebSphere Process Server ended 2015-04-30. WebSphere Process Server Hypervisor Editions are still in support until 2015-09-30. IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported product, such as IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Edition. REMEDIATION/FIXES
Please consult the security bulletin Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-4000) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21957980]for vulnerability details and information about fixes. 
The following setting in java.secruity allows you to reenable ciphers using DH and DHE key exchange that you had to disable as a temporary workaround:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize <768 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
