PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the best way to know if an event has been processed by Impact and When 

SYMPTOM
Impact seems slow processing events and the policylogger log files don't show any information about which events are being processed


CAUSE
Impact processes many events in parallel on different threads. Finding out when each event is processed and by which policy can be troublesome.

ENVIRONMENT
Impact in a busy environment

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The log files don't show enough information about the events being processed in each instant

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A way of finding this information is to have log statements at the beginning and at the end of the policy with the ServerName, ServerSerial and PolicyName to know when a policy acting upon an event starts and finishes (the PolicyName comes by default in the lines of the PolicyLogger preceding the Thread's Name and Number)





Log ("Starting Policy PolicyName for Event with ServerName"+@ServerName+" and ServerSerial "+@ServerSerial); 

 

Log ("Finishing Policy PolicyName for Event with ServerName"+@ServerName+" and ServerSerial "+@ServerSerial);
