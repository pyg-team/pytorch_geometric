SSL https secure encryption rsa TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What kind of things can an OpenPages IT administrator review when troubleshooting SSL issues? 

CAUSE
When setting up SSL for an OpenPages environment, there are multiple methods for defining secure connections / protocols.

ANSWER
In an OpenPages environment, SSL connections can be implemented at various junction points / nodes. Here are some examples:


 *  Secure connection (HTTPS) between the browser and the load-balancer Secure connection between the load-balancer and the OpenPages application server(s) Secure connection between the browser and the IBM Cognos reporting server Secure connection between the OpenPages application server(s) and the IBM Cognos reporting server(s) 

When troubleshooting / testing SSL connections with the OpenPages application, an OpenPages administrator should test and review TechNote # 1611070 and the following: Identify and Test the OpenPages HTTPS URL Used by the End Users: 

 *  Open a supported browser. Go to the OpenPages HTTPS URL that will be used by end users  * Note: Other URLs could be used (but the URLs must be defined in the server certificate otherwise certificates errors / warnings will occur).
   
   Verify that there are NO browser warnings.  * If warnings do occur, utilize the browser to review and download the certificates which can include a server certificate, intermediate certificate, and a root certificate. 
    * Review the certificate's:  * Valid from Date 
       * Valid to Date 
       * Review the common name (CN), organization (O), organizational unit (OU)
      
      
    * Review the installed certificates on the application server(s) and/or load-balancer(s)
   
   

Identify and Test the IBM Cognos HTTPS URL Configured in the Properties:  *  Open a supported browser. Go to the IBM Cognos HTTPS URL that will be used by end users  * Note: Other URLs could be used (but the URLs must be defined in the server certificate otherwise certificates errors will occur).
   
   Verify that there are NO browser warnings.  * If warnings do occur, utilize the browser to review and download the certificates which can include a server certificate, intermediate certificate, and a root certificate. 
    * Review the certificate's:  * Valid from Date 
       * Valid to Date 
       * Review the common name (CN), organization (O), organizational unit (OU)
      
      
    * Review the installed certificates on the application server(s) and/or load-balancer(s)
   
   

Identify and Test the IBM Cognos HTTPS URL Configured in the Properties:  *  Open a supported browser. Go to the IBM Cognos HTTP or HTTPS URL Attempt to login with a valid username and password  * If the login fails, review the Cognos log files. 
    * If the login fails, review the URLs defined in OpenPagesSecurityProvider_OpenPagesSecurityRealm.propertiesfile. 
    * If the login fails and using SSL, verify that the Java cacerts has all the appropriate certificates installed.
   
   

Identify and Test the Cognos SDK Connection:  *  Open a supported browser. Go to the OpenPages URL. Login with an administrator id. Configure a computed field (if using computed fields). Test out of the computed field and verify it displays properly.  * If the computed field fails, review the standard set of log files. 
    * If the computed field fails, review the aurora.properties to make sure the proper Cognos URLs are defined. 
    * If the computed field fails and the properly URLs are defined, review the the Java cacerts has all the appropriate certificates installed.
