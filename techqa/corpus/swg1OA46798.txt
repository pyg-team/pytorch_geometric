APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Shutdown of the MQ agent will result in ABEND A03 if there are
   still outstanding connections to the queue managers at the time
   that the KLV LOADER subtask is detached.
   
   You will also see a symptom dump of user completion code 0300 in
   JESMSGLG if IEA995I message is not suppressed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring 7.3.0 users.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Shutdown of the MQ agent will result    *
   *                      in ABEND A03 if any attached MVS tasks  *
   *                      have not terminated. You will also see  *
   *                      a symptom dump of user completion code  *
   *                      0300 in JESMSGLG if IEA995I message is  *
   *                      not suppressed.                         *

   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The MQ agent attaches a few MVS tasks under the Engine
   LOADER TCB. These MVS tasks rely on the code running under
   the Engine PRIMARY TCB to drive them to terminate during
   agent shutdown. However, a logic error in the code doesn't
   wait for these code to finish. As the result, some MVS
   tasks may be left in the Engine LOADER TCB, leading to A03
   ABEND when the Engine LOADER TCB is subsequently detached.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is corrected to ensure all MVS tasks are driven to
   terminate during the agent shutdown.
