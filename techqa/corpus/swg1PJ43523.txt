APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The current PE 5.0 documentation has a forward slash associated
   with
   the Router parameter.
   Here is what was documented since PE 4.5.1:
   
   <Router
   xmlns="http://www.filenet.com/ns/fnpe/2004/06/ws/schema">
           /connectionPoint2</Router>
   
   Here is a link to the corrected documentation page in the CPE
   5.2.1 documentation:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.0/com.ibm.
   p8.pe.dev.doc/web_services/ws_usage_regions.htm?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.pe.dev.doc/web_services/ws_usage_regions.htm?lang=en]
   
   In the current CPE 5.2.1 documentation, the example Router
   specification is correctly shown as:
   
   <Router
   xmlns="http://www.filenet.com/ns/fnpe/2004/06/ws/schema">
      connectionPoint2</Router>
   
   The forward slash when passed in to PE, worked in PE 4.5.1.
   However, in PE 5.0 and CPE 5.2.x and all subsequent releases,
   the BPM software no longer accepts the forward slash in front of
   the connection point name in the Router parameter.
   
   Here is the error that is returned if the Router parameter
   contains the forward slash:
   <faultcode>soapenv:Server</faultcode>
   <faultstring>Failed to retrieve bootstrap information.
   java.net.MalformedURLException: "/CP1" is not a valid Connection
   Point URI.
   Root Cause:
   "/CP11" is not a valid Connection Point URI.</faultstring>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the forward slash before the control point name.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When the control point name in the Router parameter has a    *
   * leading forward slash, this error will be seen:              *
   *                                                              *

   * "/CP1" is not a valid Connection Point URI.</faultstring>    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Do not include a slash before the control point name in the  *
   * Router specification, as described in the current            *
   * documentation:                                               *

   * The Router parameter should something look like this:        *
   * <Router                                                      *
   * xmlns="http://www.filenet.com/ns/fnpe/2004/06/ws/schema">    *
   *    connectionPoint2</Router>                                 *
   *                                                              *
   * with no "/" before the "controlPoint2" value.                *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A leading forward slash before the connection point name in the
   Router specification was required and accepted in PE 4.5.1.
   But in releases since then, the leading slash is no longer
   accepted.
   The CPE 5.2.1 documentation has been fixed to no longer include
   the leading slash in the example:
