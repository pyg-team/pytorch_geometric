ABSTRACT
 Interim fix PO04782 resolves several issues that relate to displaying and filtering data items. The fix also provides some KPI dashboard updates. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Interim fix PO04782 resolves the following issues in IBM Intelligent Operations Center. The fix supersedes interim fix PO04526 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039370].


Displaying data items on maps
An issue that affects performance can occur when you configure the filter to display data items from one or more data sources. A message that indicates that content is being loaded is displayed for a very long time before the data items are refreshed and displayed on the map. The problem gets worse in proportion to the number of data sources that you select.

Some other updates that resolve performance issues are also included in this fix.

Filtering data items
In the Filter window, in the When pane, when you use the Only on option to configure data items to be displayed only for specific dates, items that do not match the Only On filter settings are still displayed on the map.

KPI dashboard
There are some esthetic and usability issues with the KPI dashboard: 

 *  Some tooltips and text are partially covered up by either icons or widgets. The Trends window is not big enough to fit all the content. In the Indicators window, when you select values from the Filters list, the displayed KPIs are not updated until the focus moves away from the Filters list. 


In the Indicators window, the values in the Filters list are not mapped correctly to KPI ranges. When you select a value from the Filters list, the corresponding KPIs are not displayed correctly. Also, after an update to a KPI name, the dashboard either continues to display the old name, or the name is displayed as an empty space. 

In the Trends window, adjusting the Frequency Units value has no effect on the presentation of data on the Chart and List tabs. 

SQL Server data source error 
A data import error occurs if you use an SQL Server data source where one of the properties has a BIT data type. Multiple repeat errors are displayed. The following example shows the type of errors that are displayed: 

00000098 DataReceiverL I com.ibm.ioc.datareceiver.wm.DataReceiverInsertWM persisteData java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "false" 
at sun.misc.FloatingDecimal.readJavaFormatString ( FloatingDecimal.java:1278 ) 
at java.lang.Double.parseDouble ( Double.java:521 ) 
Interim fix PO04782 provides the follow updates: 

Filtering data items by a drawn area
In the Where pane, some updates have been made that improve performance if you filter data items by selecting the Drawn area option. Also, if you pan the map, the data that is in the drawn area is refreshed.

Data source refresh intervals
You can optionally set the data refresh interval for individual data sources by configuring the dsRefreshIntervals system property. If the refresh rate that is set in the Filter window is greater than 0, then, for individual data sources, it is overridden by values that are configured in the dsRefreshIntervals system property. If the refresh rate that is set in the Filter window is 0, no data refreshes occur, regardless of any values that are configured in the dsRefreshIntervals system property for individual data sources. 
Configure the dsRefreshIntervals system property in the system properties page in the Solution Administration view. The following example shows a sample dsRefreshIntervals system property configuration, where the value of dsId is a data source ID, and the value of rate is the refresh interval measured in milliseconds:

[{"dsId":data_source_ID,"rate":refresh_interval in milliseconds]
