 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition. The GSKit that is shipped with IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition contains multiple security vulnerabilities including the â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys " TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition and WebSphere Application Server shipped with IBM Tivoli Network Manager have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6221 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6221]
DESCRIPTION: Random Data Generation using GSKit MSCAPI/MSCNG Interface Code does not generate cryptographically random data. An attacker could use this weakness to gain complete confidentially and/or integrity compromise.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0159 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0159]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in GSKit usage of OpenSSL crypto function related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact in some ECC operations.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100835 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100835] for the current score
