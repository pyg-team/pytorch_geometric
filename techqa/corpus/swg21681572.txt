Title: IBM TPAE installer is unable to run in graphical mode on Unix platform - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TPAE installation program started through command line or through launchpad is unable to run in graphical mode on Unix platform 

SYMPTOM
When you start the middleware installation program on Red Hat v6.4 platform or on any other UNIX platform, you may see the following warning message: 

./mwi_linux64.bin: line 1961: warning: here-document at line 1961 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `/dev/null') 

The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag.


CAUSE
The cause of this error is either
1) The Exceed xterm program was used to remotely access the UNIX system.
2) VNC Server not installed on the system where the installer is running.
3 ) A firewall is enabled on the platform where DISPLAY is exported for an application/VNC Server installed on a different machine


ENVIRONMENT
Unix



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1) The Exceed xterm program is not supported by the TPAE installer. The preferred method to access a remote UNIX platform is to use the System Console (local access). If the System Console is not available, use the VNC client.
2) The VNC server should be installed on each platform where the TPAE installer is running 
3) A firewall should be disabled when you export DISPLAY for VNC Server or any other application installed on a different machine
