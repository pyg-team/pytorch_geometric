QUESTION
 Is there anything I can do to quickly reduce the size of the OCTIGATE database if I have not been running the datatrim script and the database has grown to an excessively large size? 

ANSWER
Ideally, you should set up your ITCAM database (OCTIGATE) pruning and optimization when you create the Managing Server. Click here [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcamfad.doc_7101%2FMS_install_guide%2Fopgd0021008724.html] for details on optimizing the database which can be found in the Managing Server Installation Guide. 
In the case of an extremely large OCTIGATE database that has not been trimmed by the datatrim script on a regular basis, you may want to consider dropping and rebuilding the following 4 tables. 

request 
method 
serverstats 
gc_data 

These 4 tables are usually the big ones. Recreating them will not harm ITCAM in any way other than the fact that the data will be lost. 

 * DB2: To recreate the tables in DB2, DROP and then CREATE the tables similar to the way they are dropped and created in the <MS_HOME>/etc/am-db2.sql script . 
 *  ORACLE: To reduce the size of the tables in ORACLE, use the TRUNCATE command. 


In addition, another technote has been provided that includes AS-IS scripts to help remove large amounts of data. Click here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21383986]to see how it's done.
