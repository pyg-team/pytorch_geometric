QUESTION
 What version of CICS Explorer is included with my Rational Developer for System z version? 

ANSWER
In order to take advantage of new API changes and enhancements, current versions of CICS Explorer are required to access current versions of CICS Transaction Server. Each time there is a new release of CICS TS there is an associated release of CICS Explorer. 

New releases of CICS Explorer continue to support older releases of CICS TS. For example, since CICS TS v4.1 was released in June 2009 and CICS TS v4.2 was released in June 2011, the breakdown is as follows: 


 * CICS Explorer 1.0.x supports CICS TS 4.1 (and CICS TS 3.2) 
 * CICS Explorer 1.1.x supports CICS TS 4.2 and CICS TS v4.1 (and CICS TS 3.2) 
 * CICS Explorer 5.1.x supports CICS TS 5.1 (and CICS TS 4.x and 3.2)
