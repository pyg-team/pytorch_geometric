PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Outbound processing errors 0509-036 0509-150 0509-022 0509-026 libdbt12d.a (shr.o) cannot load program sortidoc, GENTRAN:Server for UNIX (5719) 

SYMPTOM
Error: exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program sortidoc because of the following errors: 0509-150 Dependent module libdbt12d.a(shr.o) could not be loaded. 
0509-022 Cannot load module libdbt12d.a(shr.o). 
0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Check to see if LIB_PATH (if on AIX) environment variable or SHLIB_PATH (on HP
or SUN) environment variable is set to ${EDI_ROOT}/lib.
2. Make sure it is set to the environment in which user is running translation.
If not, export it for now and have the path, ${EDI_ROOT}/lib added to .profile
later:
export LIB_PATH=${EDI_ROOT}/lib 
or: 
export SHLIB_PATH=${EDI_ROOT}/lib 

LIB_PATH (or SHLIB_PATH) is the path to shared libraries. This path is 
necessary for any application that uses shared libraries to run on the UNIX 
box.
