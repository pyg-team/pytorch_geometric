ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   Playback fails to enter NLS characters
   "ﾷﾵﾶﾎﾏﾅﾠﾃﾄﾆￔﾐￒﾊﾂﾈ￞ￖￗﾍﾡﾌ￣￠￢ﾙﾕﾢﾓﾔ￫￩￪ﾚﾗﾣﾖﾁ￡ﾤﾥﾀﾇ" into an applet.
   Using Sun JVM there is no problem. It only is happening using
   Microsofts JVM.
   
   
   Steps to repro:
   I could not reproduce this problem but I have no confidence that
   I am using the MSJVM.
   
   I am supposed to have MSJVM on my machine since it is Win2000.
   When I disable using Sun Java in the IE Advance Options, the
   browser behaves as if there is no Java support.
   
   I tried to download and install a copy of MSJVM, but even though
   the install program appeared to work there is no improvement.
   The install program did not come from Microsoft since they no
   longer offer the MSJVM.
   
   When I run the Java Enabler, the list of JREs do not seem to
   include any MSJVM.
   
   So, I am at a loss as to how to get a copy of MSJVM and then to
   force my IE browser to use it so that I can at least duplicate
   the customer problem.
   
   
   
   Workaround:
   Even though the customer knows Sun JVM works, they want problem
   resolved with MSJVM.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Even though the customer knows Sun JVM works, they want problem
   resolved with MSJVM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Error causing GUI Test to not function properly for input
   characters in applet using MSJUM
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Determined to be works as designed
