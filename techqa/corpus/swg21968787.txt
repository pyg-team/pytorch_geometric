Title: IBM DASH Services Stops Automatically After Few hours.  "Too many open files" - United States

Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) - JazzSM service shuts down automatically after running for a few hours. The systemOut log has messages indicating: "Too many open files" 

CAUSE
The open files ulimit option is set too low for the OS user that run the DASH server process

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The SystemOut may contain messages like:
###
[9/30/15 9:09:07:765 EDT] 000000a6 HttpMethodDir I 
org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector executeWithRetry I/O 
exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Too
many open files 
### 

Check the ulimit settings for the user. Execute the following on the command line:

ulimit -a 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Websphere Support generally recommends a minimum value of 8000 for the open files ulimit setting. To increase the value to 8000 execute:

ulimit -n 8000

That value can be used initially and increased if it determined to be too low. The value is only good for the current log in session. Once a working value is determined, the value must be set at the system level to make it permanent. The following Websphere documentation provides more detail on setting the ulimit value:
