APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Core dump of ncp_g_event on solaris whilst performing isolated
   suppression.
   
   Memory corruption is occurring as a result of a bug in SunStudio
   11. There appears to be a problem with the std::deque STL
   container in the version of SunStudio used to build 3.9. This is
   Oracle issue CR 6363210: std::deque memory corruption. This is
   fixed in subsequent patched versions of SunStudio, to be
   integrated into the build system for future releases of ITNM.
   
   Symptoms:
   The symptom of this bug is a core dump of ncp_g_event on solaris
    in any current release of 3.9. It affects no other platforms.
   
   Under normal usage, the core dump will provide a stack trace in
   inconsistent places, as the issue involved is one of memory
   corruption. It typically appears as a problem whilst trying to
   allocate memory, but in a variety of areas of the code.
   
   Using memory profiling tools (eg libumem), the stack trace will
   show the issue in the CNCPDynamicGraphBreadthFirstSearch class.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The fix is to use a different STL container, a std::list, for
   the affected part of the RCA processing
