APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user observed slowly increasing memory usage but struggled
   to pinpoint which part of configuration or traffic caused this.
   It turned out that having log target Identical Event Detection
   enabled, especially in combination with log target type
   syslog-tcp, did hold memory for a long time, as in this
   specific scenario many unique log records got created and where
   hold even beyond the Identical Event Detection timeout.
   It turned out this part of hold memory is not captured in the
   log target status provider, so customer could not pinpoint this
   specific log target to be the driver.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either shortly disable/enable the log target object to reclaim
   hold memory,
   or do not use Identical Event Detection (a preferred practice
   anyway to safe resources on DataPower),
   or more specifically don't use Identical Event Detection if the
   log target type is syslog-tcp.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The logging target status might not reflect actual memory used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.5.0.16, 7.5.1.15, 7.5.2.15, 7.6.0.8 and
   7.7.1.1
