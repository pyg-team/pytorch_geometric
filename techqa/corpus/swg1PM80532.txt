ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Abstract:
   Application monitoring status reset to DISCOVERED if TEMA
   synchronization takes place before Data Collector has
   initialised
   
   ---------------------------------
   Users Affected:
   All users of ITCAM for WebSphere agent.
   
   ---------------------------------
   Problem Description:
   After a period of running the status of applications which had
   monitoring enabled is reset to DISCOVERED. If the
   WASAppDiscovered situation is not running this can lead to a
   period of time when the application is not being monitored (The
   WASAppDiscovered situation is disabled in this case as the
   customer does not wish to enable monitoring for all
   applications)
   
   Current scenario of recreating:
   1. start the KYN TEMA and disable the WasAppDiscovered situation
   2. Generate conditions where the CPU usage is as close to 100%
   utilization as possible
   3. start WAS (or restart WAS)
   
   After WAS restarts the DC will reconnect to the TEMA agent. On
   connection the TEMA synchronizes the application list and
   status' with the DC.
   Sometimes the DC initialization does not finish before TEMA
   synchronization request, and the list of applications is not
   complete, or even empty, which causes the application status to
   then be reset to UNDEPLOYED.
   After the DC initialization is complete, the status is moved to
   DISCOVERED.
   
   (When the status changes to UNDEPLOYED this may not be visible
   due to the timing when samples are taken)

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of ITCAM for WebSphere 7.1
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WebSpere server restart may cause
   * reset of monitoring application status to DISCOVERED.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update KYN agent to version 7.1.0.3 IF5
   * or newer.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Some conditions, like high CPU or disk busy might cause, that
   DC connects to TEMA before it is fully initialized, and then
   during application info synchronization, application are
   wrongly "discovered" again".
