PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 EIF probe configured to run through PA does not come up as expected even thought its configured correctly. 

SYMPTOM
EIF Probe will not start up from PA. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The PA log shows that its trying to start the probe but it can not. The following message get repeated again and again in the PA log file. 

: Debug: Launch process, argv[0] = C:\IBM\Tivoli\Netcool\omnibus\probes\win32\nco_p_tivoli_eif.bat : Debug: Launch process, uid = 0 

: Debug: Signal event object '69c' in thread 5. 
: Debug: Reset event object '69c' in thread 4. 
: Debug: Process 'EIFPROBE' has stopped. Start time 1302120629, Stop time 1302120629 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following command using bat file in PA config will NOT work:

Command '%OMNIHOME%\probes\win32\nco_p_tivoli_eif.bat -pa NCO_PA -propsfile %OMNIHOME%\probes\win32\tivoli_eif.props' run as 'user' 

The workaround is to either use Windows Service or use below command in PA config file to start up probe from PA.

Command '%OMNIHOME%\probes\win32\nco_p_nonnative %NCHOME%\platform\win32\jre_1.5.6\jre\bin\javaw -Xrs -cp 

%OMNIHOME%\probes\win32\nco_p_tivoli_eif.jar;%OMNIHOME%\probes\win32\NSP
robe.jar;%OMNIHOME%\java\jars\evd.jar;%OMNIHOME%\java\jars\log.jar nco_p_tivoli_eif' run as 'user'
