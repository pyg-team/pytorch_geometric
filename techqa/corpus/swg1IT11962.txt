APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Integration Bus uses International Components for Unicode
   (ICU) code page converters to convert data. There are four
   possible forms of Arabic character shaping, however, ICU
   libraries by default provide the conversion capability only in
   Isolated Form.
   ICU converters do not deal directly with combining characters,
   bidirectional reordering, or Arabic shaping, for example. Such
   processes, if required, must be handled separately.
   
   Since IBM Integration Bus relies on the default behaviour of ICU
   converters, the support for codepage 420 in the product is
   limited to Isolated Form for Arabic characters.
   
   IBM Integration Bus Knowledge Center topic ac00408_ will be
   updated to clarify the support for codepage 420.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus using Arabic code page
   converters.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The Knowledge Center topic on "Supported code pages" (ac00408_)
   does not document the restriction on Arabic character conversion
   using code page 420  being limited to the Isolated Form only.
   
   <i>There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

   tools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm</i>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated with the support
   restriction on Arabic codepage 420.
   
   Topic ac00408_  will be updated to point to a new topic about
   "Arabic Code page CP420 support".
   
   The new topic includes the following information:
   
   If you are working with messages in Arabic code page CP420, the
   character conversion is restricted to Isolated Form. ICU
   converters do not deal directly with combining characters,
   bidirectional reordering, or Arabic shaping.
   
   The integration node can input, manipulate, and output
   application messages that are encoded in code page IBM-420 with
   the following restrictions:
   
    * By default, ICU does character to character conversion which
   is equivalent to Isolated form in Arabic.
    * ICU converters do not deal directly with combining
   characters, bidirectional reordering, or Arabic shaping, for
   example. See the ICU converter user guide :
   http://userguide.icu-project.org/conversion/converters. [http://userguide.icu-project.org/conversion/converters.]
    * Therefore, when working with code page 420 in IBMÂ®
   Integration Bus the character conversion capability is limited
   to Isolated Form for Arabic language.
