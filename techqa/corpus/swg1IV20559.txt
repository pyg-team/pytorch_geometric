ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   ITM 6.23
   Tivoli Log File Agent 06.23.01.00
   
   Problem:
   
   We are attempting to do failover to our two EIF probe servers
   for both
   the ITM Logfile Agent and postemsg.  It appears that this
   failover works
   for our boxes that are not behind firewalls.  However, it does
   not seem
   to work for boxes that are behind firewalls.
   
   
   
   When I bring down the probe server on tiveif1 and try to do a
   postemsg,
   I get the following error.
   
   
   
   $ /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/postemsg -f /opt/IBM/ITM/config/post.conf -r
   MINOR -m
   "Lar>
   
   tec_put_event failed, errno = 38
   
   
   
   If I change my ServerLocation to point just to tiveif2
   everything works
   fine.  It doesn?t appear that the failover capability is working
   if my
   agent is behind a firewall.
   
   
   
   Same thing with the Logfile Agent. If I point the ServerLocation
   to just
   tiveif2, I get my events.  However, if ServerLocation is
   pointing to
   both and the primary server is down, I do not get my events.
   Once again
   the failover doesn't work.
   
   The TcpTimeout and PingTimeout parms were not in the customers
   config file.
   
   
   There is a technote available for the functionality of this
   paramater at
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV00828 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV00828]
   
   "Editing the Event Integration Facility configuration" section
   of the
   ITM 6.2.3 FP1 Admnistrator's Guide does not specify the details
   about
   TcpTimeout or PingTimeout or NumberOfPingCalls parameters.
   
   
   This information needs to be added to the Adminstrator's Guide
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is a technote available for the functionality of this
   paramater at
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV00828 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV00828]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   correct information. When the 6.3 version of ITM is released
   the documentation will be availaible.
