APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The purpose of this DOC APAR is to update the PCF
   documentation for Channel Authentication Records
   to include a syntax diagram similar to that in
   the MQSC reference.
   .
   The syntax diagram for the MQSC command in the
   following link shows that WARN should not be
   used together with USERSRC(CHANNEL) or
   USERSRC(MAP).
   .
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/
   topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/sc14440_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/sc14440_.htm]
   .
   And
   .
   PCF description of command MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC
   .
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/
   topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/pc20640_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/pc20640_.htm]
   .
   The new Channel Authentication Record objects
   are much more complex, with a combination of
   primary attributes and secondary attributes where
   the validity of the secondary attribute (e.g. WARN)
   depends on the value Of a primary attribute
   (e.g. USERSRC).
   .
   Capturing all the valid and invalid combinations
   in a text description is extremely difficult.
   .
   A DOC APAR is the best solution to update
   the PCF documentation for Channel Authentication
   Records to include a syntax diagram similar
   to that in the MQSC reference.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ Version 7 Release  *
   *                 1 Modification 0.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Syntax of PCF command MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC is complex and
   description in V710 infocenter does not show clearly the uses
   and restrictions of the parameters and values for the different
   types of channel authentication records.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  === Documentation update to MQ V7.1 Infocenter ======
   Refer to MQ V7.1 infocenter link:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/
   topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/pc20640_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/pc20640_.htm]
   
   The MQ V7.1.0 Infocenter will be updated with a syntax diagram
   for the PCF command Set Channel Authentication Record:
   >WebSphere MQ
   ->Reference
   -->Administration reference
   --->Programable command formats reference
   ---->Definitions of PCFs
   ----->Set Channel Authentication Record
         The description of the PCF command Set Channel
         Authentication Record (MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC)
         will be updated with a syntax diagram similar
         to the diagram for the MQSC commmand
         SET CHLAUTH found in the following infocenter link:
         http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/ [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/]
