ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Virtual Servers: VMware VI 6.2.1
   
   Problem Description:
   
   In large VMware environments, if the VMware agent is configured
   to run situations and historical data collection, requests from
   the TEP might time out before the agent responds with data.
   The result is most or all of the views in a workspace will be
   blank.  This is after the TEP does show data for the first 5 to
   15 minutes after starting the agent.
