APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 20 with redundant licensing.
   After installing the IBM SPSS Statistics 20 FixPack 1 the
   program does not launch anymore on Macintosh and Linux Client
   operating systems.
   Only the splash screen with no error message is displayed.
   
   The issue was reported to IBM SPSS Development and is already
   corrected by updating the available Client FixPack's 1 for
   Macintosh on Linux on 14. March 2012.
   
   The problem did not occur with normal network license. The
   problem occured on
   redundant licensing with Macintosh and Linux clients only.
   Windows Clients
   in redundant environments were not affected.
   The issue was caused by the file statsenv.sh being replaced by
   an older version with date 8. Sept 2011 of this file in the
   installation directory.
   Therefore the existing redundant server information on LSHOST
   environment variable was overwritten and replaced with:
   
   # Setup LSHOST Variable
   #export LSHOST=
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The Fix Pack 1 for IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 for Macintosh and
   Linux Clients are already updated and available for download.
   The file statsenv.sh is no longer overwritten by the installers.
   Please download the new FixPack's:
   20.0-IM-S20STATC-Mac-FP001.dmg  and
   20.0-IM-S20STATC-Linux8632-FP001.bin
   If you have already installed the older FixPack's prior to 14.
   March 2012 please use the following workaround:
   After installing the Statistics 20 FixPack 1 for Macintosh or
   Linux open the file statsenv.sh on the clients in a
   text editor and enter the redundant server names (or IP
   addresses) separated by colon on the export LSHOST row on the
   bottom of the file and save it.
   The file statsenv.sh is located on Macintosh in the MacOS folder
   of the Statistics 20 installation directory:
   <installation directory>/<product>.app/Contents/MacOS
   On Linux the file is located in the bin folder of the Statistics
   20 installation directory:
   <installation directory>/bin
   
   The LSHOST environment variable at the bottom of the file should
   have the following structure:
   Export LSHOST= server1:server2:server3
