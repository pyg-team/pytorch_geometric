~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* NOTE: The menu item 'Maintain/Rights/Users' allows a 'standard' user to perform changes (write access) to the logon/user/security configuration of an end user. However, it does not allow them to modify any financial information. For this reason, from Controller 10.3 onwards this menu item is allowed. 

 * The reason why this menu item is allowed (for standard users) is the concept of allowing a customer to create a non-Finance administrator user (for example, a menu of the I.T. department) whose job is to create new (or modify existing) users in the system. However, that 'standard' user would not use the Controller software for any financial administration (instead, merely I.T. user administration purposes).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

TIP: The method to restrict users to only seeing some menu items, is by creating a 'security group' and restricting the rights as required:
