APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The hook at before or after  "on file exists on local
   mirror" does not seem to be active
   1. Create a multisite environment (database and
   distributed) with two sites
   2. Do not create the upload RDS jobs
   3. Hook a dummy script at before on file exists on
   local mirror (with a message box to see if it is
   effective)
   For example:
   Function CopyFileFromRemoteSite(ApplHndl As
   Long,Sstr As String,FirstPar As Long,SecondPar As
   Long,ThirdPar As Long ) As Integer
   msgbox "entering the code"
   End Function
   4. Connect to the secondary site (vault
   configuration set to site 2)
   5. Save and release a CATIA Part
   6. Connect to the primary (vault configuration set
   to site 1)
   7. Look for the CATIA Part just created before
   8. Do a copy file on it
   Problem: you do not get the message
   box:  "entering the code"
   User Remarks:
   1.I've looked deeply in the documentation and I
   was not able to see that a setting is required to
   activate this hook
   2.Of course in my scenario the windows remote
   copy makes the file available but I would need to
   use this hook to create a RDS upload job (basically
   a RDS upload job when required). Indeed the
   windows remote copy is much slower and you can
   not put a compression.
