PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An error occurs when trying to save a search template:Content Engine COM API 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An error occurs when trying to save a search template:

Content Engine COM API error. IDispatch error #107 The operation requires that the following property have a value '<property name>' [Code=8004026b] ... Object Reference [OBJECT_STORE:4] A required property is added to the Document Class superclass using Enterprise Manager. Adding a property to the Document Class superclass also adds the property to all the sub classes under the Document Class superclass. One of those sub classes is the Stored Search class. A Search Template object belongs to the Stored Search class. Since the Stored Search class now has a required property, the system complains when trying to save the new search template because there is no value present for the required property on the new template. . .hence the error.

Remove the required property from the Stored Search class and you can now save the Search Template.
