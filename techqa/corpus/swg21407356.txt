Title: IBM DataStage Director receives errors and aborts when trying to browse folders. - United States

Text:
Information Server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In DataStage Director, the following errors occur when try to view folders in a project:

Error calling subroutine: DSR_EXECJOB (Action=5); check DataStage is set up correctly in project <project name> (The connection is broken (81002))

Error calling subroutine: *DataStage*DSR_SELECT (Action=3); check DataStage is set up correctly in project <project name> (The connection is broken (81002)) 

CAUSE
The errors were received because the Logging Agent was not running.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Check permission's on the project. Verify the user has RWX permission's on the files in the project. 
 2. Verify the Agents, Logging Agent and ASB Agent, are running:
     * On Unix/Linux execute the following:
       
       ps -ef | grep java | grep Agent
       
       If the Agents are not running they need to be started. When the Agents are running you would see entries similar to the following:
       
       $ ps -ef | grep java | grep Agent
       
       root 295106 1 0 Feb 03 - 9:09 ./../apps/jre/bin/java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=./../conf/auth.conf -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.ConfigURL=file:./../conf/sas.client.props -Djava.util.logging.manager=com.ibm.ws.bootstrap.WsLogManager -Djava.util.logging.configureByServer=true -classpath ./../conf:./../lib/java/ACS_client.jar:./../lib/java/ACS_common.jar:./../lib/java/ASB_utils.jar:./../lib/java/ASB_util_client.jar:./../lib/java/WASClient.jar com.ascential.acs.logging.agent.LoggingAgentSocketImpl
       
       root 413844 1 0 Feb 03 - 76:25 /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/bin/RunAgent -Xbootclasspath/a:conf -Djava.ext.dirs=apps/jre/lib/ext:lib/java -Djava.class.path=conf -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/conf/auth.conf -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.ConfigURL=file:/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/conf/sas.client.props -Djava.util.logging.manager=com.ibm.ws.bootstrap.WsLogManager -Djava.util.logging.configureByServer=true -class com/ascential/asb/agent/impl/AgentImpl 
       
     * On Windows go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services and verify the ASB Agent and Logging Agent services are started.
    
    

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To start the Agents:


 * On Unix/Linux run the following command as root to start the ASB Agent and the Logging Agent.
   
   /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/bin/NodeAgents.sh start
   
   The path shown in this command assumes that the product is installed in the default location. Your path will vary if you installed IBM Information Server in a different location. Then verify the Agents are now running (see step 3 above). If the Agents did not start successfully you can check the directory ../u2/IS810/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode for the following files which may have additional information:
   
   asbagent_startup.err
   asbagent_startup.out
   logging-agent.err
   logging-agent.out
   
 * On Windows go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services and start the ASB Agent and Logging Agent.
