psirt; java SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM SDK Java Technology Edition, Version 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 that is used by IBM Rational Build Forge. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2014. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6457 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6457] 
Description: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) 


As the new version of JDK does not support secure communication with protocol SSLV3 and below (review article 1688165: IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition fixes to mitigate against the POODLE security vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688165] for details), ensure that your connections (JDBC, agent to console connection, Java API to Build Forge service) doesn't use SSLV1, SSLV2, SSLV3 protocol; otherwise it will cause Error: SSLv3 SSLContext not available.

For example: 

If your BuildForge uses sqlserver 2005 and sqlserver 2005 enables sslv3 for its connection, 
BuildForge will throw the following exception when connectting to sqlserver 2005 by jdbc:

Caused by: org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create
PoolableConnectionFactory (The driver could not establish a secure
connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption. Error: SSLv3 SSLContext not available.)
Caused by: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The driver
could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: SSLv3 SSLContext not available.

Note: If you need 7.1.1.4 iFix contact IBM support Build Forge 7.1.2.0 - 7.1.2.3 7.1.2.3 iFix 4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+Build+Forge&fixids=buildforge-7.1.2.3-4-0090&source=SAR] Build Forge 7.1.3.0 - 7.1.3.6 7.1.3.6 iFix 2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+Build+Forge&fixids=buildforge-7.1.3.6-2-0078&source=SAR] Build Forge 8.0 - 8.0.0.2 8.0.0.2 iFix 3 [https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-build-forge/releases/8.0.0.2iFix3] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If BuildForge does not enable SSL for the Console and Agent communication, or Console and API communication, you are not affected by CVE-2014-6457. 

 

If BuildForge was installed with WebSphere Application Server (WAS), and BuildForge is using the WAS JDK, refer to the WAS security bulletin [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692943].
