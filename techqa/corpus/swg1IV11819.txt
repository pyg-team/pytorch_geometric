   Issue :
   Upon deployment of the new Version of the SCOM Probe, we found
   some
   minor mistakes in the documentation SC22-5409-00
   
   ISSUE :  (3) Page 11 ff - Properties ConfigKeyFile and
   ConfigCryptoAlg are
    supported by the probe (and needed for Password encryption).
   They
   should be listed in the list of valid properties, too !
   
   L3 reply :
    These properties are a generic properties which already
   documented in Probe and Gateway Guide. The document need to
   point to
   Probe and Gateway Guide instead of OMNIbus Administration Guide.
   
   PROBE Developer states:
   These are generic properties, reference link is recommended.

   * In the -Properties and command line options- topic of the    *
   * probe documentation, it is not sufficiently clear that       *
   * generic Netcool/OMNIbus properties (such as ConfigKeyFile    *
   * and ConfigCryptoAlg) are documented in the IBM Tivoli        *
   * Netcool/OMNIbus Probe and Gateway Guide.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The updated probe documentation will be published with the   *
   * next asynchronous documentation update, currently planned    *
   * for January 20, 2012. This publication date is subject to    *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The probe documentation will be updated as follows:
   
   1)
   The second paragraph of the -Properties and command line
   options- topic will be amended to read as follows:
   
   The following table describes the properties and command line
   options specific to this probe. For information about generic
   Netcool/OMNIbus properties and command line options, see the IBM
   Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Probe and Gateway Guide
   (<current_version_ref_number>).
   
   2)
   All references in the documentation to generic properties (such
   as ConfigKeyFile and ConfigCryptoAlg) will be amended to clearly
   describe such properties as 'generic Netcool/OMNIbus'
   properties.
