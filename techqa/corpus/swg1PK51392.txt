ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I am using the UOWManager to start a new local transaction in
   which to do some database work.  My understanding is that I am
   supposed to commit the transaction within the run method of
   the UOWAction since the local transaction is configured to be
   application resolved. However, when I do commit in the run
   method I get the following exception somewhat later when the
   UOWManager.runUnderUOW() method is finishing up:
   
   [7/17/07 16:03:10:536 CDT] 0000003e LocalTransact E
   J2CA0024E: Method commit, within transaction branch ID <null>
   of resource pool jdbc/WPSDB, caught
   
   com.ibm.ws.exception.WsException: DSRA0040E: WebSphere
   internal error occurred. Please contact WebSphere support with
   the following data: Cannot commit SPI local transaction.
   DSRA0250E: An exception was received by the Data Store
   Adapter. See original exception message: Action = LT_COMMIT is
   not allowed for the current transaction state =
   NO_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM WebSphere Application Server version *
   *                 6.0.2 and 6.1 users of UOWManager            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Message J2CA0024E was produced during   *
   *                      the termination of the runUnderUOW()    *
   *                      method                                  *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An application was using the UOWManager to start a new local
   transaction in which to do some database work.  The
   transaction was committed within the run method of  the
   UOWAction since the local transaction is configured to be
   application resolved. However, when the commit was done in the
   run method the following exception occurred when the
   UOWManager.runUnderUOW() method was finishing:
   
   [7/17/07 16:03:10:536 CDT] 0000003e LocalTransact E J2CA0024E:
   Method commit, within transaction branch ID <null> of resource
   pool jdbc/WPSDB, caught
   
   com.ibm.ws.exception.WsException: DSRA0040E: WebSphere
   internal error occurred. Please contact WebSphere support with
   the following data: Cannot commit SPI local transaction.
   DSRA0250E: An exception was received by the Data Store
   Adapter. See original exception message: Action = LT_COMMIT is
   not allowed for the current transaction state =
   NO_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE.
   
   This problem only occurred when the Activity Session service
   was enabled for the server, and the application component from
   which the call to runUnderUOW() was made, was configured with
   a local transaction resolver of Container At Boundary. When
   using runUnderUOW the application's resolver configuration
   should be ignored - but when the Activity Session service was
   enabled this was not being done.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Class UOWManagerImpl has been changed so that a local
   transaction containment that is begun during the runUnderUOW()
   method will have a resolver of Application.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fixpack 6.0.2.25 and 6.1.0.13. Please refer to the recommended
