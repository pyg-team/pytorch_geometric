PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document will assist you in collecting the data necessary to diagnose and resolve IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) Agile Planning issues. 

CAUSE

This MustGather will assist you in collecting the data necessary to help you diagnose and resolve the issue. If you are unable to determine the root cause using the information collected, you should open a PMR with IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/contact] for further investigation providing the data collected. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

You can use the IBM Support Assistant Lite (ISA Lite) Data Collector tool [https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.team.concert.doc/topics/t_using_the_isal.html] to quickly collect diagnostic files, such as log files, configuration files or to run traces. This tool is bundled with RTC 4.x and above. ISA Lite collects information about your Jazz Team Server environment and stores the information in a .zip archive file. If you have a need to open a service request with IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/contact] for further assistance, you can send the archive file with the data collection so that they can help diagnose and fix problems. 


The information below should be gathered in addition to the normal information and log gathering done by ISA Lite.
