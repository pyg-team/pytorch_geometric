What does this message mean? 
ANSWER
Troubleshooting checklist of most probable causes 


** You may have reached the maximum possible number of processes per user. Use the following to change: 


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * # chdev -l sys0 -a maxuproc=200 
   sys0 changed 
   

** This can be due to paging size on the system. Sometimes, allocating more paging space than necessary results in unused paging space that is simply wasted disk space. If you allocate too little paging space, a variety of negative symptoms may occur on your system. To determine how much paging space is needed, use the following guidelines: 
 * 
 * 
 * INIT: Paging space is low. 
   ksh: Cannot fork no swap space. Not enough memory. 
   Fork function failed. 
   fork () system call failed. 
   Unable to fork, too many processes. 
   Fork failure - not enough memory available. 
   Fork function not allowed. Not enough memory available. 
   Cannot fork: Not enough space. 
   
 * 
 * 
 * # iostat 
   # vmstat 
   # lsps 
   
   You can change the paging space so that it is no longer automatically used when the system starts. This is done with the chps command (example:# chps -a n paging00).
