   01.Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.1.1 editors
      cannot find copybooks referenced by a -INC statement before
      column 7.
   02.The RDz PL/I parser can not handle REORDER entry/procedure
      options or expressions in INIT attribute repetition factors.
   03.The PL/I rule "Use INITIAL with STATIC data declarations"
      ignores levels and will incorrectly mark a static data
      declaration when all of its sublevels are initialized.
   04.In Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.0.1, editing a
      COBOL program containing VARBINARY SQL type results in
      real-time syntax check error: "BLOB expected instead of this
      input"
   05.In RDz V9.1.1, the PL/I real-time syntax check gets stuck in
      a loop and the PL/I initialization takes many minutes.
   06.EXEC SQL statements are not correctly modeled in the Data
      Division for custom COBOL code review rules.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Modified the COBOL parser to accept the -INC statement
      before column 7.
   02.Modified the parser to support REORDER entry/procedure
      options and expressions in INIT attribute repetition
      factors.
   03.Modified the PL/I rule "Use INITIAL with STATIC data
      declarations" to not mark a static data declaration that has
      all of its sublevels initialized.
   04.Updated the COBOL parser for SQL types introduced in recent
      versions of DB/2.
   05.Identified and fixed a performance bug in the PL/I parser.
   06.Modified model population code to make sure data division
      EXEC SQL statements are correctly modeled.
