Title: IBM How to remove MD5 in Lotus Quickr for Domino - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
MD5 is used in Domino self-certification.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The default Certificate Signature Algorithm used by Domino self-certification is MD5. In your SSL configuration, if you are using Domino self-certification, you are using MD5. If you want to remove all MD5 uses, you need to follow the instructions in this technote:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21586810 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21586810]

and replace the certificate. To replace the certificate, you can apply a third-party CA-issued certificate which does not use MD5 as the certificate algorithm, or do the following:


 1. Run <DominoDir>\jvm\bin\ikeyman.exe 
 2. Create a new key database by clicking "Key Database File [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc/v10/ibm/9atikeyu.htm#PToC_11] -> New", choose "PKCS12" for the key database type. Set password for it. 
 3. In ikeyman, creating a self-signed certificate by clicking "Create -> New Self-Signed Certificate" [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc/v10/ibm/9atikeyu.htm#PToC_13]. Input the key label. Check the "Signature Algorithm" field and make sure it is not MD5. Input the remaining fields. 
 4. Create a new keyring (.kyr) file, using the certsrv.nsf database (which is created based on the advanced template csrv50.ntf 'Server Certificate Admin' in Domino Admin). Please use the same information used in the self-certificate created in step 3. Copy the created files .kyr and .sth to your Domino server's data directory, e.g. <DominoDir>\data directory. 
 5. Install GSK5-iKeyMan and unzip it. This tool might not work in Windows Vista and newer OS, itâ€™s working in 2003.
    
    5.1 Extract the gsk5-ikeyman.zip file into a directory that has no spaces in the name
    5.2 Start the command line shell (cmd); change directory to the directory where you extracted gsk5.
    5.3 Execute the following command: gskregmod.bat Add
    5.4 Run IKeyman by executing: runikeyman.bat 
 6. In GSK5-iKeyMan, open the .kyr file created in step 4, and enter the keyring password. 
 7. In GSK5-iKeyMan, select "Export/Import" button. Make sure choosing "Import Key". Browse to the certificate file created in step 2, and enter the certificate's password. Then the self-certified key created in step 3 is imported. 
 8. In GSK5-iKeyMan, delete original "KeyPair" by selecting "KeyPair", then clicking the "Delete" button. 
 9. Configure your Domino server to use this .kyr file by opening the server document, then select "Ports -> Internet Ports -> SSL key file name". Save and restart Domino.
