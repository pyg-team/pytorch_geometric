APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An Impact policy making use of a Schedule with several
   TimeRangeGroups is reporting incorrect on call statuses for some
   of these groups.  Certain groups seem to be always on call,
   while others are always off.  This is often at variance with the
   configuration of the TimeRangeGroups being used and also with
   the on call status reported for the TimeRangeGroup when viewed
   through the Schedule configuration in the Impact GUI.  A full
   export including TimeRangeGroups, Schedule and Policy have been
   provided to Impact development for analysis.
