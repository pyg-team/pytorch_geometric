APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While monitoring the operating system with tools such as ps
   -elf the memory usage for the amqzlaa0 process is growing to a
   point were all the memory was consumed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the queue manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   You may be impacted by this problem if you are using MQ
   asynchronous consume and messages with message properties
   are being got, and those properties have been requested to be
   stripped out of the message, but the resultant
   required buffer is larger than 8k.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   If the message data is too big to fit in the standard 8k
   buffer with the message properties in, but the
   application has asked for them to be stripped out, and that will
   fit, then MQ temporarily allocates a bigger buffer.
   However, MQ fails to free the temporary buffer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to ensure that a temporary buffer, if it has been
   allocated, is ultimately freed.
