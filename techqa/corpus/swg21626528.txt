Title: IBM CWSIS1522E: The messaging engines request for a database connection timed out - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your client or application requests fail while trying to connect to WebSphere Application Server Messaging Engine even though the Messaging Engine is running 

SYMPTOM
You see these errors in the SystemOut.log: 

FreePool E J2CA0045E: Connection not available while invoking method createOrWaitForConnection for resource jdbc/jms.

SibMessage E <BUS NAME:ME NAME> CWSIS1522E: The messaging engines request for a database connection timed out.


CAUSE
Client requests time out is the reason for CWSIS1522E:

In most cases this problem happens because the messaging engine has encountered a limitation in the currently configured size of the connection pool used by the data source. The Connection Pool used by the data source of the messaging engine is too small and this results in the client requests timing out. .


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the maximum number of connections in the Connection Pool to a number that meets your requirements and is supported by your RDBMS: 


Resources -> JDBC -> Data sources -> data_source_name -> [Additional Properties] Connection pool properties.

Please refer to this link: Tuning the JDBC data source of a messaging engine [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.nd.doc%2Finfo%2Fae%2Fae%2Ftjm0230_.html]


Note: When increasing the size of your connection pool make sure to check your RDBMS documentation to ensure your database supports the required number of concurrent sessions.

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, capture the problem in a trace using the directions in the following document::
