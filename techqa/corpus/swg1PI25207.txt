APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have deployed Modeler 16.0 FP1 with Concurrent user
   licensing. You have internal and external clients trying to
   access a license token from this license manager.  The external
   clients consistently cannot receive a license, though it seems
   clear their initial communication has succeeded and a license
   token actually has been checked out.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a  future release.
   
   The problem may be the MTU setting on your VPN.  Safenet
   Sentinel RMS License Manager  does two things with the client/LM
   communication:
   1) It pads the packets to 1460 bytes
   2) It sets a "Do not Fragment" bit.
   
   So if your MTU setting is less than 1460 bytes, your VPN will
   want to fragment the packet, but the "Do not fragment" bit is
   set and so it can't.  The net effect is that the request for a
   token comes in, the LM responds, but neither the LM response to
   client nor the client acknowledgement it has the token gets back
   to the involved parties.  After 300 seconds, both give up -- the
   LM thinking the client is no longer on the network, and the
   client thinking the LM doesn't exist.
   
   An Enhancement Request has been submitted to SafeNet to address
   this issue (our ECM00206067).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of the Sentjnel RMS License Manager with IBM SPSS      *
   * Client products operating over a netowrk with MTU set < 1500 *
   * bytes.                                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The Sentinel RMS License Manager regularly pads its replies  *
   * to clients to 1474 bytes.  In networks where the MTU setting *
   * is < 1500 bytes, these replies never make it back to the     *
   * client.                                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * This behavior has now been resolved in Sentinel RMS 8.6.1    *
   * License Manager.  Please update to the IBM Concurrent        *
   * Licensing Tools 9.6 which incorporates Sentinel RMS 8.6.1    *
   * License Manager.  This release of the licensing tools is     *
