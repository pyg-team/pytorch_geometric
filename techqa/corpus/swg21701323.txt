QUESTION
 How do you enable Flash Player on Windows Server 2012/2012R2 to have it available while scaning with IBM Security AppScan Enterprise? 

CAUSE
AppScan Enterprise requires that a Flash Player *.ocx file be installed on the scanning servers so that it can execute Flash during a scan. In Internet Explorer 11, the Flash Player *.ocx file comes with the browser. However, itâ€™s not available by default on Windows Server 2012/2012R2. 

ANSWER
On Windows 2012 or Windows 2012R2 where the AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanners are installed perform as follows: 


 1.  Open Server Manager. 
 2.  In the Configure this local server section, click Add roles and features. 
 3.  Click through the wizard to the Features page. 
 4.  Expand User Interfaces and Infrastructure (installed), and select Desktop Experience. 
 5.  Finish the wizard and reboot the server. 
 6.  Open Internet Explorer 11. 
 7.  Open the page that has the rich media content in Internet Explorer. 
 8.  Click the tools menu in the upper-right corner of Internet Explorer. 
 9.  From the tools menu, choose Manage Add-ons. 
 10. Select Shockwave Flash Object from the list.
     
     Note: Ensure that your current website has rich media content. If the current website does not contain rich media content, Shockwave Flash Object doesn't appear in the list. 
 11. Click Enable, and then click Close.
