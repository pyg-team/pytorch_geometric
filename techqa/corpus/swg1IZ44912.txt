ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPC Explorer process widget cannot display process instances
   which have been deployed in 6.1 and before
   .
   Starting with BPC 6.1.2 the rendering technology to provide
   process instance monitoring was changed in the BPC Explorer. Up
   to BPC 6.1.0 SVG was used as display technology, starting with
   BPC 6.1.2 SVG was replaced by DOJO as rendering technology. The
   SVG based viewer uses an SVG file that was stored in the
   template, the DOJO based viewer uses the information provided in
   a BPEL file stored together in the template.
   The issue can be resolved by a re-deploy of an "6.1" process
   template, but not for already running instances.
