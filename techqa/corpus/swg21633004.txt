PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use this document to quickly find the appropriate MustGather for issues in the DASH service in Jazz for Service Management. A separate collection guide is provided for each of the following areas: General Issues, Installation, Performance, and Security 

CAUSE
For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs), particularly if the data is gathered before opening the PMR with IBM® Support.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting MustGather data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if: 




 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity. 
 * Locating root cause can speed up a development code fix.
