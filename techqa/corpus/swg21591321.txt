RESOLUTION: 

To correct this you have to manually change the application pool in IIS - It defaults to DefaultAppPool, so you change it to Classic .NET AppPool. 

Do the following steps (the process is described on Microsoft pages: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731755%28v=ws.10%29.aspx [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731755%28v=ws.10%29.aspx] ): 


 1. Open IIS Manager with "Start -> Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager". 
 2. In the Connections pane (on the left), expand the server node and click "Application Pools". 
 3. On the Application Pools page, select "DefaultAppPool". 
 4. In the Actions pane (on the right), click "View Applications". 
 5. Select the ASE application (you may have two application, Root application and ASE application) and then click "Change Application Pool" in the Actions pane. 
 6. In the "Select Application Pool" dialog box, select "Classic .NET AppPool" and then click OK. 
 7. Restart IIS.

PROBLEM 

When accessing the ASE webpage you may get the following error: 

HTTP Error 404.2 - Not Found
The page you are requesting cannot be served because of the ISAPI and CGI Restriction list settings on the Web server.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=6]


CAUSE: 

ISAPI features "ASP.NET v4.0.3" and "ASP.NET v4.0.3 (64)" were not allowed: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=7] 

 

RESOLUTION: 

Allow those two features. 

 

 

 

 


PROBLEM 

You get the following error when accessing the ASE webpage: 

HTTP Error 401.2 - Unauthorized
You are not authorized to view this page due to invalid authentication headers.

RESOLUTION: 

If you use the Jazz platform, then you would need to "enable" Anonymous Authentication in IIS 7, as in the following picture: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=9] 

 

If you use the LDAP authentication, you need to add the Windows Authentication package, since your Windows Server 2008 machine doesn't include a windows authentication scheme. 

Open up Server Manager (one way to do this is by right clicking the computer node from within the start menu and choosing Manage). Expend the Roles node. Right click the Web Server (IIS) and choose Add Role Services. You'll get the following wizard, just scroll down a bit and check Windows Authentication under the security node.

Enable "Windows Authentication" and "Basic Authentication" and disable "Anonymous Authentication" in IIS authentication panel:

PROBLEM 

You get the following error when accessing the ASE webpage: 

HTTP Error 401.1 - Unauthorized
You do not have permission to view this directory or page using credentials that you supplied.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=12] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591321&aid=12]


CAUSE: 

This error was associated with another error showing when running the Configuration Wizard: 

Unable to configure virtual directory
