APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is receiving "Cannot create Exception..." errors in the
   SEL.  The reason for this is because procedure
   asisp_Process_MVS_Event was introduced in TBSM 1.5 patch 40 (LA
   fix 1.5-BSM-0040-E25) to properly handle processing of message
   IEFC452I.  This involved some TBSM customization, on NT/WIN,
   for both JES3 and JES2 customers.  Steps to properly process
   IEFC452I are documented in 1.5 PATCH 40 release notes.  This was
   not included in TBSM 2.1.1 documentation and should be added.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Replace the section JES3 Support in Chapter 5 Installing and
   Configuring Source/390 Components with the following.
   
        In a JES3 environment, started tasks console (STC)
        messages are the same as batch job console messages.
        Because of this, Tivoli Business Systems Manager
        cannot distinguish between a message from an STC and
        one from a batch job. If a Tivoli Business Systems
        Manager administrator adds batch jobs and STCs to an
        operating system with identical names under JES3,
        unpredictable results will occur. Refer to the
        appropriate Release Notes for functions you want to
        implement for information about other JES3 limitations.
   
        Special Processing for IEFC452I JCL Error
        Message Required for both JES2 and JES3
        One of the limitations of JES3 is that all resource
        types are the same. This may cause Tivoli Business
        Systems Manager to place the message on the wrong
        resource. The IEFC452I message must be handled the
        same for both JES2 and JES3 environments.
        To configure the IEFC452I message in Tivoli Business
        Systems Manager perform the following steps:
          1. Insert a generic object to any OS of your choice.
          2. Name the object JCL ERRORS FOR IEFC452I
          3. Drag and drop this resource to a Business System
             of your choice.
          4. Clean up exception messages posted to the generic
             object JCL ERRORS FOR IEFC452I
   
             There is a SQL job provided named Clear JCL Error
             Exceptions that must be configured before use. When
             enabled, it is set up to run daily at midnight.
             This SQL job may also be run manually.
             To set up Clear JCL Error Exceptions, perform the
             following steps:
   
             a. Edit Clear JCL Error Exceptions using SQL
                Enterprise Manager to clear exceptions that
                are posted to JCL ERRORS FOR IEFC452I.
                Change parameters as follows:
                (e.g. exec asisp_testexception OBJ id,
                sname CLERROR_osname K
                where id is the id of JCL ERRORS FOR IEFC452I.
                (Hit keys <ctrl-shift-pf12> to display id. The
                first five digits represent the id. Do not use
                leading zeros.) and osname is the operating
                system instance name for your OS.
                Repeat line to make as many calls as necessary
                for each OS name.
             b. Enable SQL job Clear JCL Error Exceptions.
   
        IEFC452I Message Processing Conditions
        1. When the IEFC452I message is received and the resource
           is found in the database, the message is placed on the
           appropriate resource.
        2. When the IEFC452I message is received and the resource
           is not found in the database:
             - The message is not posted.
             - The table MVS_ErrorLog is updated with a recording
               message.
        3. When the IEFC452I message is received and multiple
           objects of the same name and different resource types
           are found in the database:
             - An exception message is posted to JCL ERRORS FOR
               IEFC452I
             - The table MVS_ErrorLog is updated with a recording
               message.
   
        The table MVS_ErrorLog can be viewed by running
        SELECT * FROM MVS_ErrorLog in Query Analyzer. This table
        will hold only 3 days worth of these JCL errors.
   
        Note: If the configuration for 3 above is not set up, the
              messages are not posted to any resource and are
              discarded. There is no impact to Tivoli Business
              Systems Manager.
