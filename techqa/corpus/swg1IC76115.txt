ERROR DESCRIPTION

   domain is restarted, an appliance restart might occur.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   traffic.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are DP systems running a Web Service Proxy service.
   
   When a stylesheet used by the WS Proxy is cleared from the
   stylesheet cache while that WS Proxy service is handling data
   traffic, the appliance's firmware may restart.
   
   This is caused by a programming error in accessing WS Proxy data
   structures.
