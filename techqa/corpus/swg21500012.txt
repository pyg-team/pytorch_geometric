Title: IBM Unable to connect to Ctrl Service. - United States

Text:
timeout; start discovery; stop discovery TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I receive this message when trying to use the Discovery Status page? 

CAUSE
TIP was started before the Network Manager processes (ncp).

ANSWER
When you install a Fix Pack for Network Manager, the installer will stop the Tivoli Integrated Portal (TIP) server as part of the installation process, and the ncp processes. Once completed, it will restart the TIP processes, but the user has to manually restart the ncp processes, using itnm_start ncp or ncp_ctrl. 

When TIP is restarted before the ncp processes, it fails to recover the connection between the Discovery Status page component and the ncp process responsible for stopping and starting ncp processes. This will also happen if you have created a new domain, without restarting the TIP server.

Once you have installed a Fix Pack, or when creating a new domain, ensure that all ncp processes are started first and then the TIP server can be started.
