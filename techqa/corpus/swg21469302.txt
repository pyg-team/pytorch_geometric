Title: IBM Missing "META-INF/default_ra.xml"  when executing a rules application in a J2SE environment - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When executing a J2SE application which uses rules, the following exception is seen:

ilog.rules.res.session.IlrSessionCreationException: An error occurred while the rule session was created.: 
ilog.rules.res.session.IlrSessionCreationException: ilog.rules.res.session, Message code: 10044 
ilog.rules.res.util.IlrRemoteException: Missing "META-INF/default_ra.xml" 



CAUSE
This error usually occurs if jrules-res-execution.jar is not packaged in your J2SE application.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

When invoking rules in a J2SE environment, make sure you package executionserver\lib\jrules-res-execution.jar in your application, as detailed in the documentation under WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Rule Execution Server > Introducing Rule Execution Server > Rule Execution Server basics > Execution > Execution patterns [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global933.html] 

For detailed information on packaging applications for JRules, you can refer to WebSphere ILOG JRules Execution Server Packaging Applications [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019540].

Note: If this error occurs when using the JSR94 implementation in Rule Execution Server (RES), refer to the following document: Configuration of the JSR94 environment type and res_jsr94.conf file [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21445173].
