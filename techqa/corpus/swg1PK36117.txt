APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a WebSphere ND environment, automatic syncronization of nodes
   can be set to on or off.  After installation of an ITCAM DC
   (data collector), the dc_config.sh script is executed to
   configure the data collector to run within its application
   server in the WAS ND environment.  The last part of the
   configure process is to restart the application server, but this
   process does not work if node synchronization does not occur,
   thus causing the DC to not work properly.
