APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have created a grouped scatterplot where the groups (y axis)
   are defined by two scale variables and the x-axis is defined by
   another scale variable.  You have chosen to denote the groups by
   pattern, rather than by color (the default).  After the graph is
   created you open it in the Chart Editor and attempt to change
   the marker for one of the groups.  When you apply your change,
   the graph legend is doubles, showing the old markers and now the
   newly changed markers.
