PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of a Tivoli Integrated Portal fix pack fails with the following error:

"CTGWA0086E TIP server is stopped, but other unknown running java process from /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2 must be shut down." 

CAUSE
The installation command was executed with the -j option (Java location) and the path to TIP's Java was specified

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If uncertain whether or not the -j option was used in the TIP fix pack installation command, check the TIP fix pack installation log located in the installation user's home directory. An example might look like:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The -j option is typically not required when executing a TIP fix pack install. However, if for any reason it is required, do not specify TIP's Java install, but a Java location outside of <TIP HOME>.
