Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ADDLICKEY fails because the member in the QUSRSYS/QALZALIC file (the license key repository) is damaged. 

SYMPTOM
MSGCPD2104


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, you should perform the following steps to save the current QALZALIC file, delete the QUSRSYS/QALZALIC file, and ADDLICKEY again which will also cause the QUSRSYS/QALZALIC file to be re-created. Note: The installed keys on the system (the keys viewable through WRKLICINF) will not be impacted by the missing/damaged key repository. Adding the keys into QUSRSYS/QALZALIC will not impact the installed keys: 

1. Create a save file and save the QALZALIC file.
CRTSAVF FILE(QGPL/QALZALIC) 2. Attempt to save the current contents of the QALZALIC file to a LICKEYFILE. Note: This step may fail with Message CPF9E58 - License key information not found. If this fails, you will have to manually enter the keys back in to the license key repository using the ADDLICKEY command.

Option 4 beside the file to remove. 4. Issue the ADDLICKEY command which was failing previously with Message CPD2104. 5. If you were able to create a LICKEYFILE from Step 2, add the LICKEYFILE back to the repository.
Note: If you were unable to create the LICKEYFILE, you will have to manually add the license keys back to the key repository.
