ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer's problem description
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The Problem is, that if you define a subview in a JSF jsp wihtin
   a Portlet project, the JSF tooling corrupts the jsp! I have
   attached a Project Interchange which includes 2 projects:
   a Portlet JSF project and a normal JSF Web Project. The  normal
   JSF Web Project is attached as reference, because there
   everything works fine!
   In the file JSFToolingGoodByeView.jsp I have included a JSF
   <f:subview> wich includes a formHelp.jsp. The example works fine
   when it is deployed to the server. If you now add a new control
   to the JSFToolingGoodByeView.jsp (could be an output text or an
   input field, it doesn't matter) the JSF Portlet tooling corrupts
   the jsp source code in that way, that in the design everything
   looks fine, but onthe server the jsp does not work anymore...

   ----------------------------------------------
   I have reproduced the issue on my side,Everything runs fine in
   the JSFWebAppTooling project ,as the customer said, you can add
   any component to JSFtoolingGoodByeview.jsp randomly
   ,and it works fine on WAS v6 server.
   
   But the problem is in JSFPortletToolingTest project,
   there's a <f:subview> tag inside the <f:view> in
   GoodByeView.jsp. The jsp runs fine on the first go , on Portal
   5.1server, but if you add any other component, input or output
   text etc.
   the tooling incorrectly , moves the <f:subview> tag outside the
   <f:view> tag ,and next time the "Portlet Unavailable" message is
   displayed when the control goes to GoodByeview.jsp when tried to
   run the PortletProject on the WPS5.1
   
   No exception is thrown by the Portal Server 5.1 at runtime,
   No Build time errors are shown by the JSF tooling in RAd either,
   just at runtime the portlet is shown to be unavailable.
   
   This error is very annoying, and we would be very happy to get
   a  fix... especially because in the JSP Web Project everything
   works fine ... (test it by doing the same procedure for the
   JSFWebAppToolingTest project with the JSFToolingGoodBye)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  CUSTOMER'S WORKAROUND:
   
   Right now if we want to insert a new control, we need to insert
   controls by hand or we need to cut the subviews add the control
   and paste the subview again afterwards .
   
   
   ONE MORE SIMILAR WORKAROUND :
   
   Just add any component to the GoodByeView.jsp,
   in the source, you notice, the <f:subview> tag gets moved
   out of <f:view> tag, just bring it back to inside <f:view>
   tag and everything works fine then on.

 *  Fixed in the v6.0.1 refresh pack.
