ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Unable to change Grid Properties in Catia V5
   TeamPDM Search.
   .
   Operating System:  WindowsNT/Intel V4 SP5 or higher
   Product Group:  CATIA V5R7 Service Pack 1 on WinNT/2000
   Area Affected: Infrastructure
   Showstopper: YES
   Regression: NO
   Recommended Fixes Installed: YES
   .
   Environment:
   N.A.
   .
   Problem:
   1. In Catia V5, create New Product
   2. In the Created Product do TeamPDM->Insert Part/Product
   3. Find a Any Catia Part that may be in your Database.
   In the SmarTeam Reasearch Windows, try to have more that
   the 4 following attributs (ID, state, Revision, class) in
   the Grid (by doing Grid Property), for exemple a want the
   Part Number attribut.
   You will notice that if you do the same query in
   SmarTeam, you can add all the attributs of the class in
   the Grid.
   
   
   Hello Guillaume,
   I tried to reproduce your scenario and here is my result:
   When you say you're trying to add some attributes , is it in
   the Grid property- Query - Visual settings panel window or
   when you click modify in the search editor window?
    If I click modify on this window, I can add any attributes
   I want (click attributes in the next window ) even if I m in
   Catia or SmarTeam.
   Thank you for your cooperation,
   Best regards,
   Etienne
   
   
   Additional Information:
   It is in the Grid Properties - Query - Visual.
   Regrads,
   Guillaume.
   
   
   Additional Information:
   Etienne,
   Watch difference in Grid Properties when searching by
   attributs of simple search (option 1 and 2) in the TeamPDM
   -; Find Document.
   Option 1 seems useless in an industrial environement (ex
   more than 800 catia parts). Same for Icone in V5R7 SP2.
   
   
   Additional Information:
   Can you please create an APAR for this issue. We would like
   a
   V5R7SP4 target date. This shouldn't a big issue to fixe (it
   seems
   to be just a GUI choice when openning gird windows on Insert
   Part
   search?).
   Regards,
   Guillaume.

COMMENTS
 *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   There are differences beetween the two modes of research in
   team pdm that justify the existence of both separately.
   
   1.The 'normal' search editor ( Tpdm>Find>Find document ) allows
   to access to public and private queries. You can create and save
   a query from this window or the 'search by attribute'window
   but the only way and the fastest to run this 'saved' query is
   by using this search editor window. Then we can't delete it.
   As this is the only way to execute saved query, it s normal that
   this function is launched by the search icon.
   
   2- The 'search by attribute' (Tpdm>find>find document by
   attribute) allows you to determine wich attibutes will be
   displayed in the grid result. Note that if you saved a query,
   attributes to be displayed will be also saved.
   
   Conclusion:
   There is one tool that allows you to customize queries and
   choose the attibutes you want to display and there is another
   tool that allows you to run a saved query directly.
   There is also one point that we consider as a constraintly
   behavior:  When you create a new query, the attibutes choosen in
   the last query you did are not set by default. Each time you
   create a query you have to reselest all attributes.
   You can also customize the Quickfind.bs script.
