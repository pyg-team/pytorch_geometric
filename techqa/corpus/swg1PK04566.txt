APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When client is running at stand alone server and configured the
   webserver1, webserver1 added tag in deployment.xml as follow
   this is fine since we have implemented the web server
   integration in V6. But problem was encounter that it shows only
   one application in enterprise application list from console.
   
   
   <deploymentTargets xmi:type="appdeployment:ServerTarget"
   xmi:id="ServerTarget_1108528239012" name="server1"
   nodeName="starbase2Node01" />
     <deploymentTargets xmi:type="appdeployment:ServerTarget"
   xmi:id="ServerTarget_1108579773685" name="webserver1"
   nodeName="webserver1_node" />
   
   
   Created a new profile and still see the same problem.  We have a
   ZE defect in 6.0.1 with the new adminconsole scope narrowing
   design.  The new design uses a single variable to note the
   ServerTarget.  When the application is mapped to multiple
   servers (used by multiple servers or using the new web server
   design in v6, map module to webserver and app server) this
   single variable only notes the last server listed for the
   console viewing.  So when they map the module to the web server,
   all ear files that are still valid to server1 don't show on the
   adminconsole ear list because the variable noted that they are
   only installed to a different server.  This is a defect in the
   product and needs to be corrected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround is to set default server (server1) at last will
   display all application in enterprise list.
