Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop (CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2108) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop. Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2108 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2108]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow when deserializing untrusted ASN.1 structures and later reserializing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and trigger an out-of-bounds write and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
