CAUSE
There are several possible causes for similar errors:

Scenario #1 (likely)- Invalid cache files in end user's Windows profile 

Clear the end user's cache files. 

 * TIP: For instructions, see separate IBM Technote #1516661.


Scenario #2 (rare) - Incorrect database connection nomenclature used 
Modify the data source connection (in Controller configuration) to refer only to the Oracle SID (as defined in the Oracle tnsnames.ora file) and not SERVERNAME/SID.  * TIP: For instructions, see separate IBM Technote #1574732.
