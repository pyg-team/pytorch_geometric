APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following message scenario happens when a console is
   autoinstalled without PRESET SECURITY:
     DFHSN1100 Signon at netname xxxxxxxx by user xxxxx in group
    xxxxx is complete.
     DFHSN1100 Signon at netname xxxxxxxx by user xxxxx has failed
    because the user has signed on elsewhere.
   If after autoinstall the signon transaction is run against the
   autoinstalled console and the console is subsequently deleted
   (due to hitting the default 60 minute idle timeout limit in this
   case) then there will be no signoff and the signed on user is
   left in the user directory.
   When the console is re-autoinstalled and the signon transaction
   runs for the same USERID, this will fail if SNSCOPE is active
   due to the presence of the old entry in the user directory.
   If the console autoinstall model has USERID(*EVERY) or
   USERID(*FIRST) then PRESET security is activated for the console
   and the user will be deleted from the user directory when the
   console gets deleted.

   ****************************************************************
   Message DFHSN1129 is received when a user attempts to
   signon to an autoinstalled terminal after a previous
   autoinstalled console that the same user ID was signed
   onto is deleted. The autoinstalled console is deleted
   due to the expiry of the default timeout interval.
   Although CICS deletes the console it does not signoff
   the terminal user. As SNSCOPE is active, the user is
   prevented from signing on elsewhere.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHBSTS has been changed so that when an autoinstalled console
   is deleted, any signed on user is signed off.
