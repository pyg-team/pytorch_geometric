Title: IBM Security Bulletin: GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability affects IBM SONAS (CVE-2015-7547) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM SONAS is shipped with GNU glibc, for which a fix is available for a security vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
A GNU C library (glibc) stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo() vulnerability affects IBM SONAS.
CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]

DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SONAS 

The product is affected when running a code releases 1.5.0.0 to 1.5.2.3

REMEDIATION/FIXES
A fix for these issues is in version 1.5.2.4 of IBM SONAS. Customers running an affected version of SONAS should upgrade to 1.5.2.4 or a later version, so that the fix gets applied.

Please contact IBM support for assistance in upgrading your system.

Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. During upgrade, system nodes of IBM SONAS are rebooted.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Mitigation(s) : Although IBM recommends that you install a level of code with a fix for this vulnerability, you can mitigate, although not eliminate, your risk until you have done so by ensuring that all users who have access to the system are authenticated by a firewall, which is configured to drop UDP DNS packets larger than 512 bytes and limit all replies to 1024 bytes when TCP protocol is being used.
