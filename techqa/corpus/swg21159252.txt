PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You log onto a CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA (CICS TS) V1.1.1 region and transaction route to a CICS/VSE V2.3 region. If you log out of the CICS TS region and try to immediately log into the V2.3 region, your login is not successful. You receive message DFH2411 Attempted Invalid Logon in the CICS/VSE V2.3 region. 

CAUSE
AILDELAY not equal to zero.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 Following are the steps you take: 

 1. log into the CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA V1.1.1 region first 
 2. transaction route to the CICS/VSE V2.3 region 
 3. log out of the CICS TS region 
 4. try to immediately log directly into the CICS V2.3 region

Then, CICS fails to autoinstall and returns the message DFH2411I [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/DFHVG406/1.24.12?SHELF=dfhvsh1b&DT=20020120131321&CASE=] 

CICS/VSE V2.3 requires a REMDEL (remote delete) request to get rid of remote terminals (skeleton TCTTE) created during the transaction route. 

The CICS TS V1.1.1 region keeps track of TCSE_SYSTEM_SUPPORTS_TIMEOUT which determines whether the partner supports the current process of time out and mass delete of terminal resources. If the partner does not support it, CICS TS V1.1.1 will send the REMDEL at autoinstall delete time (not at logoff). 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the AILDELAY [http://publibfi.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/DOCNUM/sc33-1651-04/SPTDFHA244] parameter to 0 in the System Initialization Table (SIT). This parameter controls how long after logoff the autoinstall delete will happen. You need to set AILDELAY to zero (0) to allow you to log off one CICS region and log immediately onto another one. You only need to do this if you have done a transaction route to that other region.
