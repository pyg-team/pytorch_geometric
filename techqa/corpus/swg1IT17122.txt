APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When configuring an XC10 grid to use encrypytion you provide a
   shared secret key to handle th encryption and decryption of the
   data. If you provide a private key rather than a shared secret
   key, the appliance may unexpectedly reload.
   
   This could also occur if the key length does not match the
   configured encryption algorithm.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure the correct type of key is used, and that the key length
   matches your configured algorithm.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower may experience a reload trying to connect to an xc10
   grid when an asymmetric key is configured incorrectly for a
   shared secret key.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.16, 7.1.0.13, 7.2.0.10, 7.5.0.4,
   7.5.1.3 and 7.5.2.1
