PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You install the GA version of WebSphere MQ for z/OS V7.0, When you start your queue manager, the following abend occurs:

STC07330 *CSQV086E WMQ1 QUEUE MANAGER ABNORMAL TERMINATION
REASON=00D40090
STC07330 IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED: 
DUMPID=006 REQUESTED BY JOB (xxxxMSTR)
DUMP TITLE=QUEUE MANAGER TERMINATION REQUESTED, REASON=00D40090
.
SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0D6 REASON CODE=00000027
ACTIVE LOAD MODULE ADDRESS=2C007000 OFFSET=0009D336
NAME=CSQMLPLM
.
STC07330 IEF450I WMQ1MSTR WMQ1MSTR - ABEND=S6C6 U0000 REASON=00D40090 

CAUSE
SYSTEM.DURABLE.SUBSCRIBER.QUEUE is defined to use storage class 
SYSLNGLV, but SYSLNGLV is not defined in your INP2 dataset. 

From the code;
,CSQM_ABEND_STARTUP_ERROR /* error encountered during startup*/ 
constant('00D40090'x) /* stg classes or system queue */
! 00D40090 will occur because either 
! your system.durable.subscriber.queue is not defined
! or 
! In the start up JCL, the dataset that defines your storage classes 
! must be included before any dataset that has definitions that use
! those storage classes, and it isn't 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
DEFINE STGCLASS(SYSLNGLV) PSID(xx)
