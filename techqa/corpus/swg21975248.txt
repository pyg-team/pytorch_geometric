To quickly view KPIs outside of the Start Center, go to the KPI Viewer application. On the List tab, you can see the KPIs that track your work, in particular, the areas that most need improvement. On the KPI tab, you can see more information about KPIs, for example, you can see details about the factors that affect the KPIs. In the Historical Trends tab, you can track the performance of the KPIs over time. In the Log tab, you can enter information about KPIs and see a record of actions that are associated with the KPIs.

You can access the modules from the Go To menu in the Navigation toolbar of the user interface.
