Title: IBM ODWEK Network CCSID Setting - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why can't I view some documents in ODWEK after upgrading my OnDemand server level? 

CAUSE
OnDemand uses Unicode to convert data between the server and client beginning at server level 8.5. Some special characters in index data can cause a problem during this conversion if the ODWEK http server is configured to have a DefaultNetCCSID other than 1208. 

ANSWER
Edit the httpd.conf file for your ODWEK instance and set DefaultNetCCSID 1208. End and restart the ODWEK http instance. This will allow special characters in index data and user passwords to be converted between the server and browser client.
