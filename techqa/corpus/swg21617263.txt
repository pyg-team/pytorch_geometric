QUESTION
 I am using a Network License for Statistics 21 Core and Base. How do I license an Add-on Module that is local to my users computer only? 

CAUSE
Because when the "Client" was installed as a "Network" install (as it should be) there is a local license file created called 'lservrc' that is created with Attributes of "Read Only". You must uncheck the Read-only checkbox and activate the local add on module.
