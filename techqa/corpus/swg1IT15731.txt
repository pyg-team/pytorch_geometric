APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A JMS node may take a long time to reconnect to a JMS server
   after a network or server outage, if the message flow has been
   configured to use many additional instances.
   
   The following sequence of informational messages may repeat
   many times before each message flow instance re-establishes the
   JMS Connection:
   
   
   BIP4649I: A Connection with the JMS provider has been made on
   behalf of node <Node Name> using Initial Context Factory
   <Initial Context Factory Class Name>.  This connection is using
   the JMS transaction mode None. :
   <Node name><Execution Group UUID>: <build information>..
   JMSConnectionManager::accessConnectionMap: :
   
   BIP4648E: JMSClient.'Broker <Broker Name>; Execution Group
   <Execution Group Name>; Message Flow <Message Flow Name>; Node
   <Node Name> The connection with the JMS provider could not
   start, or has closed for Initial Context factory <Initial
   Context Factory Class Name>. The node will try to re-establish
   the connection.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The JMS nodes now clean up broken connections more efficiently
   when reconnecting to a JMS server after a network or server
   outage.
