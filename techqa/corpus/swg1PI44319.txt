APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Since migrating to MQ V8, a start or stop of a CLUSDRA channel
   generates a MQRC 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME) event.
    Due to changes to CSQMIARC, queue-manager event messages
   with MQRC 2085 will be incorrectly generated when stopping or
   starting an auto-defined cluster-sender. This occurs due to the
   channel start/stop code getting MQRC 2085 when it tries to open
   a channel object for the cluster-sender (this is to be expected
   as the channel is auto-defined).

   ****************************************************************
   When starting or stopping a manually-defined cluster sender
   channel may result in an internal attempt to open the related
   object definition for the sender channel. Because the channel is
   auto-defined, no such channel object is expected to exist and
   therefore the resulting 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME) error
   should not be reported as a channel event as the behavior is
   expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Processing has been amended to ensure that event messages are
   not generated when the channel object is not found for an
   auto-defined cluster sender channel.
