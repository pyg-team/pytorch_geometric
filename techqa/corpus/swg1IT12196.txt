APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The remote channel pool process (amqrmppa) can encounter an
   access violation during client reconnect at MQ version 8.0 with
   SHARECNV(1) channels.
   A SIGSEGV FFST is generated from the amqrmppa process.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the SHARECNV property to a value other than 1 on the
   server-connection channel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users with MQ clients connecting over a
   server-connection channel with SHARECNV(1)
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The remote channel pool process (amqrmppa) at MQ version 8.0 has
   a heartbeat monitor thread to process heartbeats for SHARECNV(1)
   clients in an MQGET API call.
   During client reconnect the heartbeat monitor thread could
   incorrectly process a non heartbeat flow from the client which
   would free resources associated with the client connection.
   This would lead to an access violation when these resources were
   accessed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The heartbeat monitor thread has been updated to not process non
   heartbeat flows during client reconnect.
