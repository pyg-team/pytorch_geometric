APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using IBM Content Navigator, if you move to redaction mode and
   attempt to redact any MS Word or MS Pwerpoint file, the process
   completes but generates am invalid zero kb TIF file with the
   following errors seen in the virtual log file:
   
   java.io.IOException: Failed to retrieve auto generated
   annotations. Read from connection/parse content error, Exception
   message:null
   	at
   ji.server.repository.AutoRedactionManager.readAutoRedactAnnotati
   onsFromURL(Unknown Source)
   ...
   Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
       at
   com.ibm.dv.server.uploader.url.UploadUrlConnection.getInputStrea
   m(Unknown Source)
       at ji.util.jiConnectionUtil.readFromConnection(Unknown
   Source)
   
   However the problem *only* occurs when network tracing for the
   Daeja viewer is enabled in Content Navigator (via Admin ->
   Settings -> Logging tab) - if this is disabled and server
   restarted the issue does not occur.
   
   An alternative solution if network tracing is required is to set
   both "traceNet"
   and "traceUpload" parameters to "true" - this also circumvents
   the issue
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable network logging in Content Navigator (requires server
   restart to take effect)
