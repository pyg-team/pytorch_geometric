   This readme file describes how to install the APAR OA42206 for
   IBM Tivoli System Automation for z/OS (SA z/OS) monitoring agent
   for the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server TEP(S).
   
   You must have installed an ITM environment V6.1 or higher and
   the related SA Application support.
   The following packed files for the SA z/OS TEP exploitation are
   available after your SMP/E installation:
   
       ING.SINGPWS1(KAH42206)
       KAH42206 is the packed file for Windows or Linux.
   
   To install the fix, follow the instructions below.
