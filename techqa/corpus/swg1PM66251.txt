ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description
   ----------
   Create a Rhapsody project with the system architect edition
   started from the command line
   'C:\Programme\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.6\rhapsody.exe
   
   -system_architect -lang=c'. Save the project.
   
   On trying to open the C language project in CPP.
   Invoke Rhapsody form command line  -
   'C:\Programme\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.6\rhapsody.exe
   -system_architect -lang=cpp'
   
   Open/drag the earlier project designed in C language.
   Results in informative pop-up, that the language of the project
   files is changed from C.
   However, if the project is saved and loaded again gives the same
   pop-up. So the change from C does not seem persistent.
   
   
   The informative pop-up seems good, as the feature line
   'rhapsody_lang_pack' doesnt get generated with the license file
   for Rhapsody System Architect edition.
   On copying the whole package of the feature line
   (rhapsody_lang_pack) form another license file doesn?t helps.
