ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Logging on to a IBM? Rational RequisitePro? project with externa
   l project connections, the LDAP enabled user is required to log
   on to evey external project.
   Normally if two projects are connected with an external project
   connection (with the 'connect to the external project at project
    open' option enabled) and a user exists in both projects (with
   the same password), the user is prompted for his password only o
   nce during log on.
   
   But if you log on with a user who is LDAP-authenticated in both
   projects, the user must log on seperately to both of the project
   s, in spite of the fact that obviously his password is the same,
    since both projects connect to  the same LDAP-repository.
   Steps to reproduce:
   - Create to RequisitePro projects and have them LDAP enabled.
   - Create a non-LDAP enabled user in both project with the same u
   sername and password.
   - Create an LDAP enabled user in both projects with the same use
   rname.
   - Define projectB as an external project for projectA and make s
   ure  the 'connect to the external project at project open' optio
   n is enabled.
   - Now close and relogon to projectA with the userid that is not
   LDAP enabled: The login prompt will only appear once.
   - Now close and relogon to projectA with the LDAP enabled userid
   : The LDAP enabled user needs to logon twice. Once for each proj
   ect. When more external projects are defined one needs to logon
   to each of these\ projects seperately.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Login prompt for all external projects in case of LDAP
   enabled p
   rojects was displayed by design.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed logic to use the main project's username/password to
   login to all ext projects. Login prompt is displayed for all
   ext projects whose login failed with the main project's
   username/passsword.
