   instrumentation to inject a StackMapTable on each modified
   method.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * ITCAM for Applications WebSphere Agent v7.2 installed for
   * monitoring WebSphere 8.5 server running on JRE 1.7.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * When ITCAM generates byte code instrumentation for Java 1.7
   * compiled classes, it is not generating the mandatory
   * StackMapTable that is required from this Java version. This
   * results in errors while loading classes into the JVM like
   * the following:
   * java.lang.VerifyError: JVMVRFY012 stack shape inconsistent;
   * class=javax/naming/InitialContext, method=<init>(Z)V, pc=20
   *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR fix generates the StackMapTable for classes compiled
   with JDK 1.7 compiler.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following release:
   
     | interim fix | 7.2.0.0-ITCAMAD-IF0002
