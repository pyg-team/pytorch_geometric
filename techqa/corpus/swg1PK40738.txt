APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This documentation APAR should address these specific IBM
   HTTP Server installation and upgrade related issues:
   
   1. How to upgrade IBM HTTP Server.
   
   2. IBM HTTP Server V6.0.2 from Passport Advantage is a full
   product installation.  IBM HTTP Server V6.0.2 optained from the
   WebSphere Application Server Support downloads site is a
   cumulative fix download to V6.0.
   
   3. Better cross referencing for the IBM HTTP Server upgrade
   downloads between the IBM WebSphere Support site and the HTTP
   Server Support site.
   
   4. Document that with IBM HTTP Server V6.0 and V6.1, the
   installation command is now different from previous versions.
   Versions 6 and 6.1 use a ./install command rather than the java
   -jar ..... for previous versions.
   
   5. IBM HTTP Server maintenance using the Update Installer
   tool needs to be described under each of the appropriate
   "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topics (distributed
   and z/OS as appropriate), and not just under the Update
   Installer topic.
   
   6. The "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topics need to include
   details about the plugin dialog that runs only once during the
   initial installation.  How do you setup the plug-in with
   subsequent HTTP Server installations (i.e. multiple instances).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USER AFFECTED
   This APAR affects users who want to upgrade from a previous
   version of IBM HTTP Server.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
   When you read the IBM HTTP Server Version 6.0.x or 6.1
   documentation, you may encounter the following issues:
   1. The documentation does not provide a complete set of steps on
   how to upgrade the IBM HTTP Server.
   
   2. The documentation does not state that the installation
   command for IBM HTTP Server V6.0.x and V6.1 is different from
   previous versions. Versions 6.0.x and 6.1 use a ./install
   command rather than the java  -jar used for previous versions.
   
   3. The Update Installer topic in the information center
   describes the Update Installer tool. However, the process for
   IBM HTTP Server maintenance using the Update Installer tool is
   not described under each of the appropriate "Installing IBM HTTP
   Server" topics.
   
   4. The "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topics do not include
   details about the plug-in dialog that runs only once during the
   initial installation. How do you setup the plug-in with
   subsequent HTTP Server installations or multiple instances?
   
   5. IBM HTTP Server V6.0.2 from Passport Advantage is a full
   product installation. However, IBM HTTP Server V6.0.2 that is
   obtained from the WebSphere Application Server Support downloads
   site is a cumulative fix download for V6.0.
   
   6. There needs to be an improvement in the cross referencing for
   the IBM HTTP Server upgrade downloads between the IBM WebSphere
   Support site and the IBM HTTP Server Support site.
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   For the first 4 issues, improvements need to be made to the
   Information Center for IBM HTTP Server Versions 6.0.x and 6.1.
   In some cases, information is available, but it needs to be
   clarified and provided in an easily obtainable location. In
   other cases, information needs to be revised to provide clarity
   or expanded to include more details.
   
   The IBM Support team needs to fix the product downloads for IBM
   HTTP Server V6.0.2 and provide cross references between the IBM
   WebSphere Support site and the IBM HTTP Server Support site.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following changes have been made to the Information Center
   for IBM HTTP Server Versions 6.0.x and 6.1:
   
   The "Migrating from previous releases of IBM HTTP Server" topic
   has been updated.
   -The first bullet in the topic has been changed to the following
   information:
   Upgrading IBM HTTP Server from your previous installation
   When you upgrade IBM HTTP Server from a previous version,
   complete these steps to install the new version in the same
   directory location as the previous version. If the new version
   is installed in a different directory, you do not need to
   complete these steps.
   1. Uninstall the previous IBM HTTP Server version. This will
   leave behind any customized configuration files added after the
   initial installation.
   2. Rename the directory containing the files of the uninstalled
   IBM HTTP Server.
   3. Install the new IBM HTTP Server.
   4. Overwrite the new IBM HTTP Server configuration files with
   the saved files from the renamed directory.
   -A link was added from the "Migrating from previous releases of
   IBM HTTP Server" topic to the "Installing maintenance packages"
   and "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topics to make customers more
   aware of the information on installing maintenance packages.
   
   The "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topic has been updated.
   -The information prior to the steps contains the following
   information:
   Ensure that the /usr partition contains at least 100 MB of free
   space when installing to an alternate location. The installation
   fails if sufficient disk space is not available to store the
   installation data in the /usr partition.
   -Step 3 has been changed to the following information:
   Start the installation with the launchpad command:
   launchpad.sh
   launchpad.bat
   You can also start the installation from the IHS directory,
   where IHS is the installable component directory on the product
   disc. Launch the following command from the product disc:
   ./install
   install.exe
   When using the launchpad, launch the Installation wizard for IBM
   HTTP Server. Refer to the Information center topic "Using the
   launchpad to start the installation" that is specific for your
   WebSphere Application Server product.
   
   After launching the Installation wizard from the launchpad or
   from the command line, the ISMP wizard initializes and then
   presents the Welcome panel.
   
   Separate installation procedures for the WebSphere Application
   Server product, the IBM HTTP Server product, and the Web server
   plug-ins enable you to install only what you need on a
   particular machine. The installation program installs the system
   files (shared binary files), which you do not update until you
   install a service fix. Creation and configuration of Application
   Servers do not change the system files.
   -Step 11 has been changed to the following information:
   Click Next to display the IBM HTTP Server Plug-in for WebSphere
   Application Server panel. This panel collects information to
   install the WebSphere Application Server Plug-in into a
   directory that is relative to the IBM HTTP Server installation
   location, using the remote setup type.
   
   Important: If the plug-in directory does not exist at the same
   level as the IBM HTTP Server directory, the prompt panel for
   selecting the plug-ins installer does not display. In that case,
   launch the plug-ins installer from the launchpad or launch the
   following command from the plug-in directory:
   
   UNIX: ./install
   Windows: install.exe
   -A note was added for IBM HTTP Server Version 6.0 only which
   reads as follows:
   Note: Installing maintenance packages has changed from IBM HTTP
   Server version 2.0.47. See the Installing maintenance packages
   topic.
   
   -Links were added from the "Installing IBM HTTP Server" topic to
   "Migrating from previous releases of IBM HTTP Server"  and to
   "Installing maintenance packages" topics.and "Installing IBM
   HTTP Server" topics to make customers more aware of these
   topics.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The modified information center documentation will be available
   in the next update to the information centers, which is
   scheduled to occur on or before June 30, 2007.
   
   The IBM Support team is in the process of fixing the product
   downloads for IBM HTTP Server V6.0.2 and providing cross
   references between the IBM WebSphere Support site and the IBM
   HTTP Server Support site.
