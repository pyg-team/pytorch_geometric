QUESTION
 How to setup the JMS Queue Adapter to connect to a JBoss server? (SCI94964) 

ANSWER


The following link is to the GIS 4.1.1 JMS Queue adapter documentation - 



http://www.sterlingcommerce.com/documentation/gis41/conten t/saae/jms%20queue%20adapter.html [http://www.sterlingcommerce.com/documentation/gis41/content/saae/jms%20que ue%20adapter.html]





Note: A JMS queue adapter configuration setup for connecting to a JBoss server 
requires a 3rd party jar (see doc link). 
This is because GIS 4.1.1 is built on Sterling ?a??a??s noapp proprietary application server.



The 3rd party jar file needs to include the JBoss InitialContextFactory class.
