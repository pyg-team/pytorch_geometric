APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  KMQ can't handle 2 subnode registrations at the same time when
   the 2 different queue managers are monitoring the QSG
   
   Problem occurs when the two agents are trying to join at the
   same time.
   XXX0 successfully joins and thinks it is the agent monitoring
   the QSG.
   However, because XXX1 incorrectly registers the QSG subnode
   (MQYY:MQQSG), the requests for QSG data are incorrectly going
   to XXX1.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                   WebSphere MQ Monitoring V601 users.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: TEP provides randomly a wrong value     *
   *                      for QMGR Status on workspace "Queue     *
   *                      Sharing Group Queue Manager Status".    *
   *                      The displayed status is unknown in      *
   *                      fact the status is Active.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The two separate agents register the subnode to the same TEMS
   at the same time when they monitor the Queue Sharing Group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code change to ensure that only one agent registers the
   subnode of the Queue Sharing Group.
