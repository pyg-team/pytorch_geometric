APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When session command blocks are used for a particular data
   source connection, certain reports may incorrectly return
   cache'd data rather than querying the data source.
   
   The "Cache is sensitive to connection command blocks" governor
   in the Framework manager package may be checked however certain
   conditions in reports may cause the cache to become insensitive
   to differences in the command block. This may lead to a
   situation where stale incorrect data from a past run may be
   produced to the user.
   
   Cache'd data may be presented in either Report Studio or Cognos
   Workspace
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either of the following:
   1. Turn "Use Local Cache" for the queries in report studio to
   "No"
   2. Uncheck "Allow usage of local cache" governor in Framework
   Manager package to turn off cache globally
