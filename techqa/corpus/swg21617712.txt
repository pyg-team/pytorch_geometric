QUESTION
 How to remove the 'Cognos Advanced Workspace' icon from Cognos Connection thus preventing the user from opening reports within Cognos Advanced Workspace. 

ANSWER
- Remove the role/group 'Express Authors' from the user's associated groups. 

Note: This also removes Report Studio Capabilities from that user. If you wish the user to still have Report Studio Capabilities but still not be able to view the 'Cognos Advanced Workspace' icon from Cognos Connection, perform the steps outlined below: 


- Open Cognos Connection.
- Click 'Launch' -> IBM Cognos Administration.
- Select the 'Security' tab.
- Select the 'User Interface Profiles' tab on the left. 
- Click the 'drop down' arrow on the 'Express' selection. 
- Click the Properties button to open up a new window
- Remove 'Express Authors' from the groups and roles.

You should now note when you now log on as that particular user, when you check the user's capabilities they will have the Report Studio Capabilities however they will not be able to view the 'Cognos Advanced Workspace' icon.
