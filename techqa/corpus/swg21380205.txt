 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances MQ manager object tries to get a larger message from MQ queue than it is configured for. As a result, the DataPower system log will show mqrc as "2010" 

CAUSE
MQ error code (mqrc) 2010

ANSWER
Increase the "Maximum Message Size" value in the DataPower MQ manager's Object (mq-qm) and its associated XML manager's "Bytes scanned" field under the XMLParser Tab. Please note that the MQ Front Side Handler will remain in "down" state until the problem is corrected by increasing the "Maximum Message Size" value in the mq-qm object..
