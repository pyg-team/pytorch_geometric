 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why is my Guardium System Backup Config file so large ? 

SYMPTOM
The SQLGUARD_CONFIG.tgz file generated by the System Backup config process is larger than expected, sometimes in the order of hundreds of MB or greater.


CAUSE
The System Backup config file includes various configuration files including dumps from a subset of tables within the database. If any of these tables become excessively large it can affect the size of the config backup file. The table most likely to increase the config file size is REPORT_RESULT_DATA_ROW which contain audit results that have not been signed or reviewed

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In v8.01 or above run the following "cli" command to establish if REPORT_RESULT_DATA_ROW is one of the largest tables in the database:


support show db-top-tables all 

 

In v8.0 or below seek guidance from Technical Support. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Purge the REPORT_RESULT_DATA_ROW table to reduce size. 

Audit reports are only purged form the REPORT_RESULT_DATA_ROW table as part of the normal purge process if :- 

 *  the "Keep for a minimum of " value has been satisfied and/or the audit report has been reviewed or signed-off as per the "Action Required" setting. 

 

Both the above settings can be found by Tools -> Config & Control -> Audit Process Builder 

For any of the individual processes listed , the Audit Process Definition and Receiver Table sections will show the settings
