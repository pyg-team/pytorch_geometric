QUESTION
 LWJDBC Oracle: How to avoid DST (Daylight Saving Time) problems based on old session time zones 

ANSWER


Queries which compare column entries (timestamp w/o time zone) with system time of the DB server could lead to problems after changing the DST settings.

Solutions:

- Change the table to store the time zone OR

- restart GIS after time change OR

- Use following commands to refresh the idle connection of the pool: 

<install_dir>bin\opscmd -nnode1 -cREFRESHPOOL -ppoolname=<Pool> (Windows)
<install_dir>./bin/opscmd -nnode1 -cREFRESHPOOL -ppoolname=<Pool> (Unix)
