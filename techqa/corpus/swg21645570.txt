QUESTION
 How can a user's password be reset when you cannot log into Maximo 

ANSWER
If you are using Maximo security, user authentication done in Maximo, the user password can be updated. If you cannot login as an administrative user to change passwords via the Users application the password in the maxuser table can be set to a password you know so you can login and change passwords via the Users application. 

From a Maximo environment you can login as an administrative user, connect to the database for that environment with a SQL tool. 

Run the following SQL to get show the encrypted password: 

Select userid, password from maxuser where userid = '<user>' 

For example: Select userid, password from maxuser where userid = 'MAXADMIN' 

The output: 
USERID PASSWORD 
--------- -------------------------------- 
MAXADMIN 10fe6f4650b2acb49a2121d7e6133e64 

Copy the encrypted password and run update statements in the database for the environment you cannot log into. 

The syntax for each database platform is different. 
For Oracle:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD = '<value>'
WHERE userid = '<user>'

For SQL Server:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD = 0x<value>
WHERE userid = '<user>'

For DB2:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD = x'<value>'
WHERE userid = '<user>'

From the example above the update statements to set the maxadmin password to maxadmin would be:
Oracle:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD = '10fe6f4650b2acb49a2121d7e6133e64'
WHERE userid = 'MAXADMIN'

SQL Server:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD = 0x10fe6f4650b2acb49a2121d7e6133e64
WHERE userid = 'MAXADMIN'

DB2:
UPDATE maxuser
SET PASSWORD =x'10fe6f4650b2acb49a2121d7e6133e64'
WHERE userid = 'MAXADMIN'
