QUESTION
 Are keys protected and encrypted at rest and by which tool or mean. 

ANSWER
1. The LTO keys are encrypted while at rest in the keystore using a default algorithm as PBEWithMD5AndDES.

2. The keystore is also protected by encryption. The keystore is protected and encrypted using the password for the Keystore. It is a password based encryption keystore.

3. The key is protected when the key is passed and transferred to the storage device from TKLM. 

The protection is done using TLS/SSL based secure communication. Also using the proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The client certificate must be trusted as well.

4. When performing a TKLM backup, the password that is provided is used to encrypt the backup file.
