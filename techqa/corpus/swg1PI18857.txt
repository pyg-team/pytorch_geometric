APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The cicsprnt terminal emulator shows unpredictable behaviour
   when it receives a SIGHUP, SIGTSTP or SIGCONT signal. For
   example: when starting multiple instances of cicsprnt from a
   shell script and sending a single cicsprnt instance a signal,
   the shell will send a SIGHUP to all cicsprnt instances,
   resulting in termination.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, start cicsprnt with nohup to prevent SIGHUP
   signal from being sent to the cicsprnt application when the
   session leader terminates.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the cicsprnt application on UNIX and Linux
   platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The cicsprnt terminal emulator shows unpredictable behaviour
   when it receives a SIGHUP, SIGTSTP or SIGCONT signal.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The cicsprnt terminal emulator is working as designed. The
   SIGTSTP and SIGCONT signals should not be used to control the
   emulator. To run cicsprnt as a background task, the nohup
   utility should be used. The CICS TG Knowledge Center will be
   updated to include the following information in the section
   &quot;cicsprnt restrictions&quot;:<br/>- cicsprnt on UNIX and
   Linux platforms does not support being interrupted using the
   SIGHUP signal or being controlled using the SIGTSTP and SIGCONT
   signals; use of these signals might result in unpredictable
   behaviour. To start cicsprnt as a background task, cicsprnt
   must be started using the nohup utility. For example:<br/>
   nohup cicsprnt -s=&lt;servername&gt; - m=&lt;model&gt; -j -z
   &gt; /var/cicscli/cicsprnt.nohup.out<br/> <br/>
