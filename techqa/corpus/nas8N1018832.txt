PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Single Signon, a session takes 30 seconds to be established. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When using Single Signon, a session takes 30 seconds to be established. At a command line type CHGTCPDMN and press F4 to prompt. Using the DNS server TCP/IP addresses, verify that they are DNS servers. Use the following command: 

NSLOOKUP HOSTNAME(FQDN) DMNNAMSVR('10.1.1.2')

where FQDN is replaced with any valid hostname.

Remove or correct any DNS TCP/IP address that is not a valid DNS server. The DNS time-out value is roughly 30 seconds. That is usually the reason for the sign-on delays.

At 610 and above, there may also be slowness issues caused by having IPv6 running. You should refer to Rochester Support Center Knowledgebase document N1013244, DNS Name Resolution Takes Longer after Upgrade to V6R1 or later: .

Other issues that may cause a decrease in performance:

o The /QIBM/UserData/OS400/NetworkAuthentication/Creds directory has too many cache files and needs to be cleared out (use the command: RMVLNK OBJLNK('/qibm/userdata/os400/networkauthentication/creds/*')

o Check the Active Directory account for the KRBSVR400 service principal and ensure that the Trust Account for Delegation box is not checked.
