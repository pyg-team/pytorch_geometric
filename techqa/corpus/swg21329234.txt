Enabling Debugging for Rational Functional Tester Use this collector to automatically enable debug settings for Rational Functional Tester . See: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21224514 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21224514]

This collector is to be used in conjuncture with the "Enabling Debugging for Rational Functional Tester" 

 

What are the information being collected? 

This collector enables debug settings for Rational Functional Tester 7.0. 

 * Collects the ivory.properties file that has been updated. 
 * Collects collector execution information.


To check what contents has been collected, extract the .zip file that is created.  

Walk thru for "Enabling Debugging for Rational Functional Tester" 

This collector will first inform you what this data collector does. Click OK, to proceed .
