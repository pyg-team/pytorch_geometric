QUESTION
 Why, when developing a stand-alone Java™ client for WebSphere® 6.x HTTPS Web services, if the system property "javax.net.ssl.keyStore" is not set, does the following exception appear?
com.ibm.wsspi.channel.framework.exception.ChannelException: com.ibm.wsspi.channel.framework.exception.ChannelException: No key store specified and no hardware crypto defined 

ANSWER
The keystore is required in WebSphere 6.x Web services if SSL is enabled. This applies to one-way authentication and mutual authentication. 

In WebSphere Application Server version 6.x, HTTPS is made over SSL Channel Framework. When SSL channel is initialized, both trust manager and key manager are created automatically, which is why a keystore is required.
