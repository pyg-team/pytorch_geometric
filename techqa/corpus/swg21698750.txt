Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
CVE-2015-0138 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM Rational ClearCase. The GSKit that is shipped with IBM Rational ClearCase contains multiple security vulnerabilities including the â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. IBM Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs.


VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational ClearCase 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.17, 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.14, and 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.7.
The IBM GSKit is used if ClearCase on Windows platforms is configured to integrate with IBM Rational ClearQuest, Rational Team Concert, or Jira with communication over SSL (https). This applies to any integration using Change Management Interface (CMI), and to non-CMI based UCM-enabled CQ integration via OSLC. If your ClearCase deployment is not using these integrations, or not using SSL with the integrations, then your deployment is not sensitive to this attack. The UCM-enabled CQ integration without using OSLC (SQUID) is not sensitive to this attack.
CMI and OSLC integrations



ClearCase Windows Client Version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.7 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.14 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 8.0 through 8.0.0.3 Not affected 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.16 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.8 Not affected 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x Not affected
