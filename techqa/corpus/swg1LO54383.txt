PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Abstract:
   Provides capability to define textarea input fields on the edit
   my profile page.
   
   Problem Description:
   This iFIX provides capability to define textarea input fields on
   the edit my profile page.  To enable this feature richtext must
   be set to false.  Then add the attribute multiline="true" to the
   editable attribute section.
   
   For example:
   <editableAttribute showLabel="false"
   multiline="true">description</editableAttribute>
   
   richtext="false" multiline="true" --> textarea
   multiline="true" ---> textarea
   richtext="true" --> RTE
   richtext="true" multiline="true" --> RTE
   
   In order to be able to define the attribute above without
   breaking the configuration file, you must copy the
   profiles-config.xsd file associated with this iFIX onto your
   server.  The application will not start without the updated .XSD
   file.
