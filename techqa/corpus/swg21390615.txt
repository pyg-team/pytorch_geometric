PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message 'CNX0106E Connect failed with error 'Basic Authentication Error'. You are using IBM CICS Explorer and have configured a CICS Management Client Interface (CMCI) connection to a CICS that is managed by CICSPlex SM or a standalone CICS using the System Managed Single Server (SMSS) capabilities. 

SYMPTOM
CNX0106E Connect failed with error 'Basic Authentication Error'.


CAUSE
A 'Basic Authentication Error' will occur if the user id and password combination cannot be successfully validated by the External Security Manager (for example RACF). 

ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer users that are sending requests to a CICS using a TCPIPSERVICE that has AUTHENTICATE(BASIC) set.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Examine the CICS joblog of the target CICS. Check for messages from the External Security Manager - for example ICH408I message for RACF users. If no messages are found, check the CICS Transient Data Queue output for DFHXS messages reporting user id verification problems.

Common causes for this error include:


 * Invalid Userid 
 * Revoked Userid 
 * Invalid Password 
 * Expired Password
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Depending on the cause of the problem, specify a correct user id and password combination. If necessary contact your security administrator to ensure that the user id is valid. 

If the password has expired, use an alternative interface to change the password, for example TSO, or CESN on CICS.
