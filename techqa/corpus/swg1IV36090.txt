APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When two or more applications are getting messages from a
   WebSphere MQ queue, an application using the WebSphere MQ
   classes
   for Java receives a 2033 (MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE) reason code
   when
   performing a get operation on a MQQueue object, even though
   there
   are deliverable messages on the queue that satisfy the criteria
   of the MQGET request.
   
   com.ibm.mq.MQException: MQJE001: Completion Code '2', Reason

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS and
   WebSphere MQ classes for Java, including:
   
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.1/V7.5 classes for JMS.
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.1/V7.5 classes for Java.
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.1/V7.5 Resource Adapter.
   - The WebSphere Application Server V8.5 WebSphere MQ messaging
   provider.
   - The WebSphere Application Server V6.1 WebSphere MQ messaging
   provider who have configured the WebSphere variable
   MQ_INSTALL_ROOT to point to a WebSphere MQ V7.1/V7.5
   installation.
   
   who are getting messages from a queue using two or more client
   applications.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java +Java zOS
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When two or more WebSphere MQ classes for Java or WebSphere MQ
   classes for JMS clients attempted to read from the same WMQ
   queue, one of the clients would receive the message but the
   other client would receive the following return code:
   MQRC 2033 'MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE'
   or a null message if the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS client is
   being used.
   
   This reason code, or null message, was returned to the
   application regardless of the value of the wait interval was
   set on the MQGetMessageOptions structure for the MQGET, or the
   timeout parameter on the JMS receive call.
   
   The reason code, or null message, was also returned when the
   size of the message was larger than the default buffer size of
   4Kb, even though other messages were available on the WMQ queue
   at the time and should have been returned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for Java and WebSphere MQ classes for
   JMS have been modified to ensure that the MQGET and JMS
   receive calls honour the wait interval or timeout set, and to
   permit the client to successfully retrieve the message when the
   message is larger than 4Kb and two or more client applications
   are reading the same WMQ queue.
