Title: IBM Java Error "java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints" - United States

Text:
Websphere; Java; Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a Java program using JDK v6.0 or later connects to a remote SSL/TLS server, the following error message is thrown:

java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints


SYMPTOM
The JVM"s standard out/error log displays the error "java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints".


CAUSE
The IBM i JDK at v6.0 and later now contains the following java property in the /QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/JavaVM/jdkXX/YYbit/jre/lib/security/java.security file to disable weak signature algorithms and key lengths for certification path building and validation. NOTE: This applies to all certificates in the certification path.


 * 
 * jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024


The above property prevents the use of SSL certificates anywhere in the SSL certificate chain created with the MD2 signature algorithm or the RSA signature algorithm when the key length is less than 1024 bits. If this constraint is hit, Java will throw the following error: 
 * java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following can be done to resolve the issue: 

 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=RSA keySize < 1024
