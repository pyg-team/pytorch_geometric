APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The V7.1 Installation Guide states for the installation of a
   server or a storage agent says;
   
   "On test servers only: Use the following command to bypass
   prerequisite checks such as the operating system and the
   required memory. Do not issue this command on a production
   server.
   
   ./install.sh -g -vmargs "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"
   or
    install.bat -g -vmargs "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"   "
   
   But install still fails if a prerequisite is not met.
   For example on a test Unix host with less than 12GB of memory;
   
   ./install.sh -vmargs "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"
   
   opens Installation Manager GUI
   Error: 'The system does not meet the minimum memory requirement
   of 12 GB'.
   Next and Install buttons are greyed out, unable to proceed.
   
   ./install.sh -c -vmargs "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"
   
   opens Installation Manager CLI
   * [ERROR] IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server 7.1.0.20131126_1825
   contains
   validation errors.
        1. ERROR: The system does not meet the minimum memory
   requirement of 12 GB.
   No option to continue.
   
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager Server 7.1.x on all platforms
   
   
   
   
   Initial Impact: Low
   
   Additional Keywords:
   zz71 install bypass prereq DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS vmargs
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Invoke Installation Manager directly with the command line flag.
   (example below is for Unix)
   For the GUI version:
   
   /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/IBMIM -vmargs
   "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"
   
   For the CLI version:
   
   /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl -c -vmargs
   "-DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true"
   
   Both of these have the same effect, downgrading the prereq
   failure from
   Error to Warning, thereby allowing the Tivoli Storage Manager
   server installation to continue.
