ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Fields revert to their default values if a
   Multi-Protocol Gateway service is edited using Services >
   Multi-Protocol Gateway > Edit Multi-Protocol Gateway (URI
   "/service/MPGateway/${name}") such as:
   
     - Transaction History

     - Administrative State
     - Action when required root part is not first

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Several Multi-Protocol Gateway service properties reset to the
   default value when the Multi-Protocol Gateway is edited via the
   Control Panel or via the Services > Multi-Protocol Gateway >
   Edit Multi-Protocol Gateway link.
