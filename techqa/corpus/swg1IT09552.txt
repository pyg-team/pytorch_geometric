APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If Log Target with Archive Mode Upload cannot reach its remote
   target it will continue to Log files to be sent. Currently the
   Log Target will only mark the oldest file as '.unsent' without
   cycling through any other files, if any. This may cause, over
   time a buildup of Log Files associated with this target until
   the Remote Target is brought back up.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable Log Targets that cannot reach their configured remote
   target. No functionality is lost when disabling the object when
   the remote target is down because the Log Targets cannot upload
   any data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the use of Log Target with archive mode upload.
   
   The fix will ensure that even if the upload of the file has
   failed the file will be renamed to '.unsent'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There can be loss of log data if the remote server is down for
   an extended period of time. The fix will prevent the ramdisk
   from becoming full.
   
   The fix is available in 6.0.0.16, 6.0.1.12, 7.0.0.9, 7.1.0.6 and
    7.2.0.2.
