APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Maximo Server halts with OutOfMemoryError with thousands of
   Ad-Hoc reports stored in memory.
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   Create thousands of Ad-Hoc reports.
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   Maximo Server halts with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError with
   thousands of Ad-Hoc reports stored in memory.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   Maximo Server runs with thousands of Ad-Hoc reports stored in
   memory.
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   The Server is loading the report dialogs into memory twice and
   causes the server to run out of memory prematurely. There is
   still a limit on the number of Ad-Hoc reports that the system
   can maintain. The number of reports allowed is dependent on how
   much memory is allocated to each JVM and how many users and
   applications are being used.
