APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an eForm with a workflow policy is used and the signature
   is signed after the session times out, the connection point
   defined in site preferences is deleted when users access the
   Tasks page. A connection point not defined error is displayed in
   the Tasks page.
   
   Is there a workaround? : Users must define the connection point
   again in Site Preferences.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1 Open up an eform with a signature field.
   2 Let the session time out (30 minutes by default on WebSphere).
   3 Sign the signature.
   4 Launch the workflow.
   5 Go to the Tasks page.
   
   Actual Results: See the connection point not defined error and
   can't access the Tasks page.
   Expected Results: See the Tasks page.
