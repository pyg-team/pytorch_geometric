PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server on iSeries.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Verbose garbage collection              *
   *                      (verboseGC) is disabled by default.     *

   ****************************************************************
   Staring in version 9.0.0.5 WebSphere Application Server on
   iSeries enables verboseGC by default for the Application
   Server, Node Agent, and Deployment Manager server types; and
   when enabled, WebSphere Application Server will log
   verboseGC output to 10 sequential, rotating (i.e. rolling)
   "verbosegc" files which cumulatively consume about 100M of
   disk space per server process. This is a change in default
   behavior from previous releases wherein verboseGC is disabled
   by default for all server types, and when enabled, verboseGC
   output writes to the native process logs.
   .
   "Verbose garbage collection" (verboseGC) is a setting in the
   Java virtual machine configuration for a server type, such as
   a Deployment Manager or Application Server.  When verboseGC is
   enabled in a server configration in releases prior to
   9.0.0.5, WAS supplies the standard java option "-verbose:gc"
   to the java command line when launching the server. In
   9.0.0.5 when verboseGC is enabled WAS supplies the following
   standard and non-standard java command line arguments when
   launching a server.
   .
   -verbose:gc
   -Xverbosegclog:${SERVER_LOG_ROOT}\verbosegc.%seq.log,10,7000
   .
   These options direct the JVM to write verboseGC diagnostic
   data to as many as 10 rolling "verbosegc" logs which
   cumulatively consume about 100M of file space.  The logs are
   created in the ${SERVER_LOG_ROOT} directory alongside the
   other server logs. Notice that, on Windows, AIX, and Linux,
   the options specify 7000 garage collection events per log.
   Because the size of GC events will vary, the amount of
   cumulative file space consumed by verbosegc logs will also
   vary on these platforms.
   .
   To revert verbose GC logging behavior to that of previous
   releases, disable the verbose garbage collection setting
   in the server's Java virtual machine configuration and enter
   the standard Java command-line option "-verbose:gc" (unquoted)
   in the Generic JVM Arguments field of the same Java Virtual
   Machine configuration.  If the Generic JVM Arguments field
   contains no additional arguments that control verbose garbage
   collection logging, then the server will direct verboseGC
   diagnostic data to a native process log.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  VerboseGC diagnostic data is critical to troubleshooting memory
   and performance problems, and the overhead is generally very
   low. APAR PI82789 enables verboseGC by default to ensure
   diagnostic data is immediately available when such problems
   occur; and it redirects verboseGC output to rotating logs to
   both limit the amount of data collected and to reduce the risk
   that native process logs exhaust the available file space
   over the life of a server process.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 9.0.0.5.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
