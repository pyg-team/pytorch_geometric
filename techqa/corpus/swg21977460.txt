CVE-2015-7547 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A GNU C library (glibc) stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo() vulnerability affects IBM DataPower Gateways. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]

DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
