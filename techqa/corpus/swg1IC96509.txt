APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A PureApplication System pattern will have multiple network
   interface controllers (NICs)  when the NIC Add-on has been
   included in the pattern.   If a virtual system deployment for a
   pattern with two IP addresses fails, the second IP address may
   not be properly released for use in another deployment.
   A subsequent deployment that tries to use the second IP address
   may fail with error
   CWZIP1978E The operation failed because there are the following
   duplicates <ip>
   Note that message CWZIP1978E may also result from a deploy
   where both of the following are true:
   - The deployment specifies an environment profile with
      option:   IP addresses provided by
      set to:     Pattern deployer
   - The IP address provided at deploy time by the person
      deploying the pattern is already defined in an IP group
   That is, IP addresses included in a pool of addresses in an IP
   group cannot also be used for a deployment where the IP address
   is provided by the pattern deployer.    An IP address provided
   at deploy time should not be defined in any IP group.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Virtual system patterns with multiple IP addresses associated
   that failed to deploy correctly were not releasing the IP
   addresses correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been added to handle correctly the multiple IP address
   releases after a deployment failure.
