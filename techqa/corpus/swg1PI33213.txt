APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have your CICSVR automatic deregistration days for logs set
   to 15 days and a DWWGJCDS utility REPORT(UNDO) shows several
   recent batch jobs which are only 1 or 2 days old followed by
   some that are older than 15 days.  The report shows the rows in
   collating sequence by jobname.  After the inventory scavenger
   runs a subsquent REPORT(UNDO) shows not only the eligible
   entries deleted, but also all previous ineligible entries with
   a lower colating sequence by jobname.
