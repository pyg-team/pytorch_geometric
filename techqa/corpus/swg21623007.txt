Title: IBM Unable to start TEP Java Web Start client due to JVM failure - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The TEP Java Web Start client will fail to load due to invalid heap size value. 

SYMPTOM
When you attempt to connect to the TEPS via the TEP Java Web Start client, the client will fail and a message containing the following text is seen in a pop-up window: 

Could not create the Java Virtual Machine


CAUSE
One or both of the initial and maximum heap sizes is invalid in the tep.jnlp file on the TEPS.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open the tep.jnlp file on the TEPS. For a Windows TEPS, the directory where the file is found is <ITMHOME>\CNB. For a Linux or AIX TEPS, the directory containing the file is <ITMHOME>/<arch>/cw, where <arch> is the architecture of the system. You should see a line under the <resources> tag containing the text, "j2se". The line should be: 


<j2se version="1.5+" initial-heap-size="128m" max-heap-size="256m" java-vm-args="-showversion -noverify" />

If the TEPS is at version 6.3 or higher, the default value for max-heap-size is 512m. If the values for the initial-heap-size and/or max-heap-size parameters differ, change the values back to the ones shown above and save the file. A restart of the TEPS is not required for the changes to take effect.
