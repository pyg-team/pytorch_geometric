QUESTION
 Is it possible to set up a specific GL debit account against an inventory item? 

ANSWER
It may be necessary to set up a specific GL Debit account for each Inventory Item instead of having a global value. To accomplish this, add the hidden GLACCOUNT attribute to the screen for the Inventory application. 

Follow these Steps: 

 

1. From the Application Designer access the Inventory application. 

2. After deciding where to place the field, add a text box and open the text box properties. 

3. Here you can add the Label for the field. For the Attribute use INVCOST.GLACCOUNT and for the Lookup use GLNAVIGATOR. Now save the changes and move back to the Inventory application. You will now see the added field and you can now set up the GL Debit accounts for which ever Inventory items you like. If the Debit account is left black and there is an Organizational value in the Inventory Resources Code under the Resource section in Chart of Accounts this will continue to be used when the item is issued and there is no value set on the Inventory item itself.
