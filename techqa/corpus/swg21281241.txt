Title: IBM LDAP: The host parameter is empty. Enter a host parameter - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following error, The host parameter is empty. Enter a host parameter, is displayed in the LDAP error log after receiving an error logging in to an LDAP project in the IBM® Rational® RequsitePro® client. 

CAUSE
Although you may be able to log in to an LDAP project through ReqWeb, you may still see this message as the ReqWeb user permissions may differ from your ReqPro user permissions. There are a few things to check to determine the cause of this issue:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Try using the IP address instead of a hostname in the ldap.ini file. It is possible that the machine can not resolve the host DNS. 
 2. Attempt to ping the host using the IP and Hostname using the ping command at a command prompt. 
    
    If the pings are successful, make sure the user connecting to the project has access to the folder that the ldap.ini file resides in. 
    
    If the pings are unsuccessful, you do not have access to the host and need to consult your network administrator. 
 3. Make sure the LDAP information is still intact in the RQL file. 
    
    You should have something similar to what is shown below; at the bottom of the RQL file for the project that is using LDAP:
    Note: the RQL file is a hidden file that resides in the same folder as the project RQS file
    
    [LDAP]
    ConfigFilePath=C:\program files\rational\requisitepro\projects\LDAP Project\LDAP.ini
    
    
    If you do not see the two lines above, append them to the RQL file for the LDAP enabled project. The value of ConfigFilePath is the path to your ldap.ini file. 
 4. While rpsetup verifyconfig might verify successful, you may need to rerun rpsetup setldapconfig using a UNC path to point to the ldap.ini file instead of a local path. 
 5. If the ConfigFilePath in the project RQL file is still a local path, change it to the UNC path and retry logging in to the project.
