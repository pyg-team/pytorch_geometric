RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Disable channel authentication 

 You will need to disable connection authentication, at least temporarily. There are known issues in FTM for Check with regard to using MQ connection authorization. These problems are actively being addressed and fixes will appear in a future fix pack. The target is fixpack 3.0.0.8. 

Steps to disable connection authentication:
Open MQ command console and type runmqsc <queue_manager_name>
ALTER AUTHINFO(SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS) AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) CHCKCLNT(NONE) CHCKLOCL(NONE)
Restart the queue manager for this change to take effect.
Restart FTM for Check applications.
