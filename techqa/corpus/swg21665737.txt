QUESTION
 Several node have same names (OR some of the nodes with different name(s) and simply should not show in TEPS workspace) that needs to be deleted from TEPS tree view. Want to leave only 1 of them and remove all the rest. How to remove SOA node entry from TEPS workspace ? 

ANSWER
** Removing SOA node entry from TEPS workspace ** 

 1. Stop SOA Agent. 

 2. 2nd mouse click on the node entry that you want to remove, choose "Clear offline entry". (Note : If you have more than 1 entry to be deleted, continue to do it for all that needs to be removed) 

 3. Delete the information of the entry (removed from 2 above) from KD4.dc.properties file. (Windows: <ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\KD4\config, Unix:<ITM_HOME>/<Platform>/d4/KD4/config), and save it. 

The "information of the entry" to be removed (from KD4.dc.properties) would look similiar to this : 

8.<DP hostname>.monitor=on 
8.<DP hostname>.log=error 
8.<DP hostname>.trace=off 
8.<DP hostname>.control.count=1 
8.<DP hostname>.control.1=*;*;*;*;*;none 
8.<DP hostname>.filter.control.count=0 


 4. Remove following directory to erase old records which are remembered in this directory. 

<SOA_BASE_DIR>/KD4/logs/KD4.DCA.CACHE/persist where.. 

<SOA_BASE_DIR> = (<ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6 in Windows, <ITM_HOME>/<platform>/d4 in Unix) 

 5. Start SOA Agent. 

 6. From TEPS view, you should be able to see that the deleted entry is gone.
