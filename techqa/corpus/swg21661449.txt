Text:
71GEN-TS; 71GEN-ITM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Remote deploy of ITCAM for Transactions agents in ITM 6.3 environments fail on certain Windows and Linux platforms 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to remote deploy ITCAM for Transactions Agents onto a Windows machine with a 64bit ITM OS Agent the following message is observed: 

 * 
 * 
 * agentdepot
 * 


When attempting to remote deploy ITCAM for Transactions Agent from a 32bit ITM machine onto a 64bit Linux machine the following message is observed:  * 
 * pc
 * 
 * jre
 * 


CAUSE
ITM 32/ 64bit compatibility packages are provided to allow 32bit agents to work in a 64bit ITM environment. However certain remote deploy scenarios do not work due to certain compatibility issues are not accounted for. In the case of remote deploy, a compatible version of GSKit is missing in a 64bit environment. 

To ensure the target system can do remote deploy perform a "cinfo -t" (unix) / "kincinfo.exe -t" (windows) on the target system, and confirm that the following libraries are listed: 

 * 32bit "gs" GSKit library 
 * 32bit "ax"(unix)/"ac"(Windows) Compatibility library. 

Example: 
> cd c:\IBM\ITM\InstallITM 
> Kincinfo.exe -t

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
See Symptom section



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On Windows: 

The issue can be resolved by ensuring that a 32bit OS Agent is installed on the remote deploy target. The OS agent will installed the required AX/AC and GS packages. 

Important: That the OS agent needs to be at least at fix level Fix Pack 3 (i.e. 6.3.0.3). It resolves various known issues. 

On Linux: 

There is no 64bit remote deploy solution. A local installation must be done instead.
