APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Event reader filter analysis comparing object server fields
   (e.g.
   LastOccurrence > FirstOccurrence) results in the error: "rule
   includes an unsupported expression"
   
   Note that this appears to be an analyzer issue only.  The filter
   itself seems to work successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Perform the comparison in OMNIbus and use another field to
   filter on.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Filter analyzer: When attempting to compare two object server
   fields within an event reader filter or when comparing a field
   with getdate an error occurs: "rule includes an unsupported
   expression".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is actually a limitation in the available functionality of
   the filter analyzer in Impact 5.1.
   In order to get a clearer idea of how your filters are set up
   without relying on the filter analyzer, you can set these
   properties. Add:
   
   
   impact.<readername>.consolidatefilters=false
   
   to $NCHOME/impact/etc/ServerName_<readername>.props
   
   You should be able to see the filters in the GUI and the event
   reader log file as well as in netcool.log, excepting when the
   'like' condition is used. In order to display filters using
   'like', a further property needs to be added to the same file:
   
   impact.<readername>.uselikeoperator=true
   
   Note: all of the above relates purely to the filter analyzer and
   should not effect the ability of the event reader to parse the
   filter.
