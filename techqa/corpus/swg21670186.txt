Title: IBM Gateway uses unoptimized conditions in ObjectServer select sql. - United States

Text:
optimise; optimisation TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the impact of the use of an unoptimized condition from the Gateway on the ObjectServer? 

CAUSE
The following message appears in the ObjectServer log regarding an unoptimized condition that is submitted from the ITNM Event Gateway: 

Debug: D-CMD-003-001: Unoptimised condition1: ((LocalNodeAlias <> '') AND ((NmosDomainName = 'DOMAIN') OR (NmosDomainName = ''))) AND (Serial = ANY( serial1, serial2, serialn)) 

Where DOMAIN is the ITNM domain name and serialn is a list of Serial numbers for the affected Events. 

 

This is followed by a message reporting the ObjectServer's optimized statement:

Debug: D-CMD-003-002: Optimised condition1: ((LocalNodeAlias <> '') AND (((NmosDomainName = ANY( '', 'DOMAIN' )))) AND (Serial = ANY( serial1, serial2, serialn)))


ANSWER
The optimizer simply reorders the conditions to put those that are the cheapest comparisons first, this is determined by some simple rules. There is little to no overhead in calculating the optimization. 


The optimizer intercepts all SQL commands before anything is executed on the ObjectServer and only the optimized version is executed. There is little to no overhead in the interception.

The overhead in doing the optimization is minimal. You should not see any impact on performance as a result of the optimization actions. If you are concerned about performance in relation to these select statements please run the ObjectServer in profiling mode and send the resulting logs to IBM Support for analysis.
