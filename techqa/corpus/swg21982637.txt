ANSWER
For FileNet 5.2.1, creating indexes for multi-value properties can be done in ACCE. While for previous versions, only indexes for single value properties can be done from ACCE. Mutil-value properties indexes has to be done from database site. 

Steps to add indexes for ListOfString table is as below: 

 1.  Access ACCE administration console. 
 2.  In the domain navigation pane, click and open the related object store. 
 3.  In Object Store pane, click Data Design>Classes>Document. 
 4.  Select your document classes and then select the 'Property Definitions' tab.
     Note : if this property is inherited, go to the higher level document class. 
 5.  For your multi-valued property, click on the corresponding 'Table Name' column (for example, ListOfString) 
 6.  On the table page, click the 'Indexes' tab.
     Note : review existing indexes in case you already have an index with same column. 
 7.  Click 'Add' 
 8.  Provide a name for the index and set 'Storage location' if neededd 
 9.  Use the 'Add' bouton to add the following 3 column in this order :
     element_value (Ascending)
     parent_prop_id (Ascending)
     parent_id (Ascending) 
 10. Click OK 
 11. Click Save


Index will automatically created using the LOWER function when created on a String and the ObjectStore have the 'Force case-insensitive search' selected in its 'query' tab. Note : this is not the case if you are using DB2 10.1 or lower. In this case, this this documentation [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.ce.admin.tasks.doc/p8pcc199.htm].
