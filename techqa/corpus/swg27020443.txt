ABSTRACT
 How do you mine a CICS system dump for information about tasks that are hung making WebSphere MQ calls? Is control in MQ? What is the call? What program made the call? How long has control been in MQ? 
This Support Technical Exchange explores these questions and more using CICS and MQ dump formatters and Fault Analyzer.
