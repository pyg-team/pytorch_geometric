PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer would like to know if it is possible to clean up old objects (job histories, output files from jobs, etc.) from within the Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Job Histories can be removed by sorting on Start Time and removing multiple entries at the same time. You could filter on a specific job or have job histories returned for all jobs. 

In Collaboration and Deployment Services 4.2.1 and higher, a new configuration setting has been added to allow customers to control the number of Job/Job Step Histories that are retained. This new setting can be found in the Deployment Manager web client (aka PEA) under Configuration => Process Management => Job History Limit.

File versions can be removed by right clicking on the file and selecting Properties. Within Properties select Versions. This should display all versions and the Creation Date for each version. You can highlight multiple entries and delete them at the same time. I think sorting was an issue, so you may want them to review that they are sorted properly before they start mass deleting.
