Title: IBM LANFree backup is failed with ANS9201W after Tivoli Storage Manager
 Server OS reboot, although LAN backup is completed successfully. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 LANFree backup is failed with the following error message.
ANS9201W LAN-free path failed.
ANE4048W LAN-Free connection failed.

On the other hands, LAN backup is completed successfully.
At that time, port 1500 is not LISTENING on the Storage Agent server when netstat -na command is issued,
although Tivoli Storage Agent Service is already RUNNING status.

<excerpt from netstat -na> 
TCP xx.yy.zz.w:pppp xx.yy.zz.ww:1500 ESTABLISHED 
TCP xx.yy.zz.w:pppp xx.yy.zz.ww:1500 ESTABLISHED 
TCP xx.yy.zz.w:pppp xx.yy.zz.ww:1500 ESTABLISHED 

And "ANR8208W TCP/IP driver unable to initialize due to error in using Port 
1500, reason code 10048." is appearred in console when dsmsta is started from foreground.

This issue can be seen since Tivoli Storage Manager Server OS reboot and AD Server OS reboot,


CAUSE
It's caused since Tivoli Storage Manager server is in Domain network. 

When the server is reboot and Windows starts coming up, 
AD refresh takes a very long time like 15 minutes. 
As a result, some network connections in and out of the server are not available
until this has completed. But, TSM Server1 service has already started and thus port 1500 is not available. 

Even if Tivoli Storage Manager server is restarted, port 1500 is still not available because 
the previous attempt to start the service has already locked port 1500. 

This problem cannot be solved by restarting TSM Server1 service.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reboot Windows OS of Tivoli Storage Manager server to free the locked port. 


If it's difficult for user to reboot production server at once, specify another port number for TCPPORT instead of 1500 both on Tivoli Storage Manager server and Storage Agent.
