APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A memory leak occurs when using a syslog log target with the
   host specified as a DNS name, if the DNS service is disabled.
   If DNS is enabled, there is no leak even when the syslog host
   cannot be resolved. If the host is specified as a numeric IP
   address, there is no leak regardless of DNS setting.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use numeric IP addresses for syslog log targets or enable DNS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are systems using incorrectly configured syslog log
   targets
   (that is, log targets that are specified by a DNS name although
   DNS resolution is disabled).
   
   This results in a small amount of memory leaked for each
   log attempt on that log target.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 3.8.0.16, 3.8.1.16, 3.8.2.7, 4.0.1.4,
   4.0.2.1 and XE82 1.0.0.2.
