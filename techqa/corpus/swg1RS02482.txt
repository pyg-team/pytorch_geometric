APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With current topology of the Decision Server cluster, RES
   console is deployed outside of the cluster and SSP ear deployed
   on each node. In order to run testing and simulation services,
   users will have to manually edit RES_URL in the decision runner
   war file as the RES console won't be on the same server and
   port as the decision runner.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually edit RES_URL in the decision runner war file. For
   WebSphere, this can be done from:
   Enterprise Applications > jrules-ssp-WAS85 > Initialize
   parameters for servlets
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The scripts of Decision Server cluster should plan to update
   automatically the RES_URL in Decision Server when running
   testing and simulation services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
