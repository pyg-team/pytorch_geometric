ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After running RQS MVS product under heavy loads for 18 hours
   get an abend 906-08 trying to LOAD (or LINK, ATTACH,XCTL)
   IUCVMULT.  Dump indicates the IUCVMULT use count is x'7FFF'
   verifying that it has been LOADED (LINKed, ATTACHed, XCTLed to)
   more than 32767 times.  Master trace in dump includes msg:
   'CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE IUCVMULT EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT'
      This occurs because EZACICMT/IUCVMULT does not do DELETEs,
   but should.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of IUCV C socket interface.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ABEND906-08 occurs when loading         *
   *                      IUCVMULT because EZACICMT/IUCVMULT      *
   *                      does not do deletes.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In a multiprocess IUCV socket environment module
   EZACICMT/IUCVMULT is loaded by the interface.  At socket close
   time the interface should cleanup the environment including
   deleting any load modules it loaded.  Unfortunately the socket
   interface did not do this with the result that after a period of
   time the CDE use count limit would be reached and thus the
   interface could not load a new copy of EZACICMT/IUCVMULT.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modules EZAAE029/EZAXR029 (IUCVFORC), EZABC00X (IUCVMCOM), and
   EZABC00Y (IUCVMINI) have been changed to issue a DELETE during
   the cleanup process after a session has closed.
