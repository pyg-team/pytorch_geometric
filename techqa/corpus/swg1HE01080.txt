APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1- Build the custom library
   2- customize environment for scenario
   3. Start 3d com then VPM driver on the client.
   
   4. Declare two server commands  AddMyFilter  and
   RemoveMyFilter
   5. Create the following product structure:    ROOT----P1
   
   6. Search previously created object in search panel.
   
   7. Be sure that there is no user settings at this moment
   
   (check for presence of the file referenced by
   
   CATCDMA.VPM.PSNFILTER.DEFAULTS). If there is a file remove
   it.
   8. From search panel, contextual command  Open Part  on
   
   ROOT. No filter is loaded at this moment (this can
   be checked by expanding assembly, nothing is added inside
   
   child node).
   
   9. On root node, use contextual command  Open Part with
   
   filters  , expand  By Custom Filter  section:
   
   OK,  My Filter group  is inactive.
   
   10. Close panel, then use other method  AddMyfilter , the
   
   filter is now added to VPM filter manager. This can be
   checked
   by *collapsing* assembly then expand it,  MyFilter  is
   written
   inside child node).
   
   11. On root node, use contextual command  Open Part with
   
   filters  , expand  By Custom Filter  section:
   
   OK,  My Filter group  is active.
   
   12. Perform a  Save As Defaults . At next graph opening,
   
   custom filter will be automatically added to filter manager
   
   (you can check the file has been created by looking for file
   
   referenced by CATCDMA.VPM.PSNFILTER.DEFAULTS).
   
   13. Reset assembly, expand graph, you can see that filter has
   
   been loaded ( Myfilter  is written inside child node).
   
   14. On root node, use contextual command  Open Part with
   
   filters  , expand  By Custom Filter  section:
   
   OK,  My Filter group  is active.
   
   15. Close panel, then execute other method  RemoveMyFilter ,
   
   the filter has been removed from filter manager. This can be
   
   checked by *collapsing* assembly then expand it, nothing is
   
   written inside child node).
   
   16. On root node, use contextual command  Open Part with
   
   filters  , expand  By Custom Filter  section:
   
   KO,  My Filter group  is active although it is obviously not
   
   the case.
   
   
   
   Expected result
   
   Open Part with Filter panel should exactly reflect graph
   
   filter manager.
   
   If we apply configuration, displayed configuration will be
   
   applied to graph, it is OK, but one might just want to modify
   
   something else in the panel, and does not expect custom
   filter
   configuration to change.
