ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempting to install the Rational Asset Manager (RAM) v7.5.1.2
   Eclipse Client into the same package group as Rational
   Application Developer (RAD) v8.5.1 using IBM Installation
   Manager, resulted in a com.ibm.ut.help.common plugin version
   conflict error.
   
   
   Error_description:
   
   IBM Installation Manager (IM) 1.6.2 was being used to install
   the RAM v7.5.1.2 Eclipse Client into the same package group as
   RAD 8.5.1-iFix2
   or Rational Software Architect for WebSphere (RSA/RSA4WS) 8.5.1,
   to allow for Eclipse Sell sharing. This resulted in the
   following error being reported in the IM Agent Data installation
   log:
   
   '...
   Error during 'complete' phase:
   CRIMA1082E: The bundle
   'com.ibm.ut.help.common_2.11.3.v20130228_1957'
   cannot be installed in this Eclipse configuration because it is
   not
   equivalent to the bundle
   'com.ibm.ut.help.common_2.7.2.v20121004_1540'
   that is already installed.
   ..'
   
   
   The technote:
   - IBM Software products installed together that share a common
   environment
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21279139 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21279139]
   , shows the RAM v7.5.1.2 Eclipse Client, as shell shareable with
   RAD 8.5.1.
   
   Workaround:
   
   There is no known workaround at this time involving IBM
   Installation Manager.
   
   An alternative using the Eclipse Updater to to install RAM 7512
   with RAD 851:
   1) Install RAD 8.5.1
   2) Using RAM's update site to install the RAM eclipse client.
   Don't choose help.
