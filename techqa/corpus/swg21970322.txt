 2. Execute following command to stop the admin session:
    esadmin admin stop 
 3. Modify ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/admin/wlp/server.xml
    Add the "<authCache timeout="1h" />" to <server> element:
    <server ...>
    :
    <authCache timeout="1h" />
    :
    </server>
    (The rest is omitted.)
    Then save the changes in this file.
