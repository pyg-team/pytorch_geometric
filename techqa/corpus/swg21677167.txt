QUESTION
 Is there any change in Jazz FP3 that changed the SystemOut.log . It does not show anymore who logged into the System after installation of FP3. 

ANSWER
The SystemOut.log from JazzSM 1.1-GA had entries similar to the message below showing user logins in DASH. 

6/2/14 14:59:15:213 EDT] 0000007c RoleServiceUt I getUniqueSecurityName: uid=user1,o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm 

 

In JazzSM 1.1-FP3 the messages no longer appear. This is part of the internal changes which were made to the stop clogging the SystemOut.log with nonessential messages.

If tracking user login activity is required, the security auditing feature in Tivoli Integrated Portal is also available in DASH. Details on the security auditing:
