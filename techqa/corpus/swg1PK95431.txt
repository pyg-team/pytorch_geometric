ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  226122
   A client is wondering if there is a way to find unresolved
   elements when they were the target of a hyperlink or the main
   diagram of an element.  The Advanced Search and Replace does not
   find them.
   
   I see that the silentMode.log has reference to the UR that it is
   trying to load, but I can't figure out any way to find which
   elements refer to them.
   
   If the Main Diagram has been removed from a project, it just
   appears that there was never one set.  Although, Rhapsody must
   be trying to load it.  I checked in the API, but I see no
   difference between an element with an unresolved Main Diagram
   and an element that never had one.
   
   If the target of a hyperlink is the element that has been
   removed, the hyperlink will still have the data for it in
   dependsOn and target.
   
   There is no way to find out which model elements are referring
   to a given UR element. In Rhapsody you can look for outgoing
   relations of an element but not incoming.

   There are 2 ways to do it:
   1. Select the UR element in a diagram and click Ctrl-R.
   2. Use the "Search dialog" to find the UR, right click on it
   and select "References" from the pop-up menu.
