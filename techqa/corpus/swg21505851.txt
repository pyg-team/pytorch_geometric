Title: IBM Configure TEM Client in "sleep mode" - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Two mechanisms are available to reduce the the amount of processing that the TEM Client does. The first mechanism determines how long the TEM Client should "sleep" after it has done some processing. The second mechanism determines what times during a 24-hour day the TEM Client should remain idle. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are basically 2 mechanisms which can be used to reduce the amount of processing that the TEM Client does. The first mechanism determines how long the TEM Client should "sleep" after it has done some processing, and the second mechanism determines what times during a 24-hour day when the TEM Client should remain idle. TEM does not recommend changing the TEM Client CPU settings or TEM Client sleep settings unless you are having a problem with the default settings.

Configuring the TEM Client CPU usage:

The TEM Client will do work (evaluate relevance) for a designated amount of time then go to sleep for a designated amount of time. The setting _TEMClient_Resource_WorkIdle (default 10 ms) determines controls how many milliseconds to work before going to sleep in each cycle, and the setting _TEMClient_Resource_SleepIdle (default 480 ms) controls how many milliseconds to sleep after working in each cycle.

Note: If the value of _TEMClient_Resource_WorkIdle is high in comparison to the _TEMClient_Resource_SleepIdle setting, then the TEM Client will evaluate Fixlet relevance faster, but the CPU usage will be higher. Similarly, if the value of _TEMClient_Resource_SleepIdle is high in comparison to the _TEMClient_Resource_WorkIdle setting, then the TEM Client will take longer to evaluate Fixlet relevance, but the CPU usage will be lower.

Instructions on changing the CPU settings:

Use the Task "TEM Client Setting: CPU Usage" on the TEM Support Fixlet site to change the agent CPU parameters.

Configuring the TEM Client to "sleep" at a certain time each day:

In the second mechanism, you designate a period when the TEM Client should remain idle in a "quiet mode". A TEM Client can be put in quiet mode for a maximum of 20 hours a day. 

Note: If you put a TEM Client in quiet mode, it will not actively process Fixlets, send any reports to the TEM Server or respond to any commands so use caution when enabling this setting. To use this mechanism, you must first enable quiet mode. This is done by configuring the setting _TEMClient_Resource_QuietEnable to a value of "1". Then you configure the settings _TEMClient_Resource_QuietStartTime and _TEMClient_Resource_QuietSeconds to specify the time for the TEM Client to enter quiet mode and the number of seconds the TEM Client will remain in quiet mode.
