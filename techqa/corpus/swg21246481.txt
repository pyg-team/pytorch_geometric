QUESTION
A Notes mail user creates a mail rule. The rule executes but does not display in the Rules folder. The mail file is based on a Notes/Domino 7.x release mail template.

If the above does not resolve then the cause may be duplicate (Rules) folders, visible only in the Designer client. To check if this is the case, open the mail database in Designer and select Folders to see if there are duplicate Rules folders. 

There may be several reasons why there are duplicates, the most common being that a previous version of the folder was not removed when the mail template was upgraded. The outdated folder should be deleted. 

Sometimes, "missing" rules will appear in the remaining Rules folder and sometimes they will not. If they still do not appear, you must create a view that displays all documents with the form Mailrule, and either drag them into the Rules folder or delete them. If the rules are deleted, you may have to delete the user's Calendar Profile as well. 

To remove a duplicate Rules folder: 
1. Open the mail file in the Designer client. 

2. Open the Folders design list. 

3. The "(Rules)" folder with the older date should typically be the one to delete. If deleting the older folder causes issues, then repopulate the folder using the instructions below. 

To populate a Rules folder: 
1. Create a view with the selection formula, Select Form="Mailrule". 

2. Open the documents that appear in the view to determine which correspond to rules missing from the Rules folder. If the rule is not within the view, do not continue with these instructions. Instead, follow the instructions in the Workaround section below. 

3. *Drag the document into the Rules folder. 

* The mail templates for Notes releases 6 and 7 intentionally prevent you from dragging and dropping documents to and from the Rules folder. This functionality is designed into the QueryDragDrop event. The event must be temporarily modified to allow you to drag the rules documents back into the recreated folder.
