PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the best way to stay current and be notified when there is a security and integrity APAR for a System z product like CICS Transaction Sever for z/OS (CICS TS)? I am unable to find the security and integrity APARs for CICS TS or other System z products on the internet. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Security and integrity information for z/OS and z/VM products is provided by the IBM System z Security Portal. Incorporating the use of the IBM z Systems Security Portal in your security management processes will help ensure that system maintainers, security response teams, and auditors are up to date with the latest IBM security service and recommendations that can help ensure platform security. 

IBM strongly suggests that all System z clients subscribe to the System z Security Portal to receive the latest critical System z security and integrity service. IBM only provides access to the fix information in the IBM System z Security Portal to registered z/OS clients that have been approved by client management. If you need to subscribe to the Portal, see the instructions on the z Systems (mainframe) Security Integrity web site [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/solutions/security_subintegrity.html]. Security and integrity APARs and associated fixes will be posted to this portal. IBM suggests reviewing the CVSS scores and applying all security or integrity fixes as soon as possible to minimize any potential risk. No additional information is available from IBM Support. 

SMP/E HOLDDATA on the System z Security Portal summarizes all security and integrity APARs for each version, release, and modification (VRM) level of z/OS products. All other CICS APARs are included in the CICS Fix Lists. See Fixes by version for CICS products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008833] for links to the CICS Fix lists.

For more information, see the IBM z/OS System Integrity Statement [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&htmlfid=ZSL03361USEN&attachment=ZSL03361USEN.PDF] and IBM Systems z Security Portal Frequently Asked Questions [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ST&infotype=SA&appname=STGE_ZS_ZS_USEN&htmlfid=ZSQ03054USEN&attachment=ZSQ03054USEN.PDF].

Note that IBM does publish security bulletins for multi-platform distributed products like CICS Explorer and z/OS Explorer on the public internet. You will receive security bulletins in your e-mail for these products if you are subscribed to IBM My Notifications [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] for the products.
