APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The XPATH() function does not work on Sterling B2B Integrator
   with return code -1 detected by LASTERRORCODE() function.
   
   The LASTERRORMSG() function results appear to be empty.
   
   The xmllib->XPATH function is successful and may be used as a
   workaround.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00046311
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: Use the xmllib->XPATH() function.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers who use the XPath
   function in a Sterling B2B Integrator runtime environment.
   
   Problem Description:
   The XPath function does not work on Sterling B2B Integrator.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Sterling B2B Integrator installation scripts,
   InstallWTXService.sh/bat, need to deploy the XPath Java module,
   dtxxmlfn.jar.  Before this fix, the dtxxmlfn.jar module was not
   deployed, which in turn caused the XPath function to fail.
