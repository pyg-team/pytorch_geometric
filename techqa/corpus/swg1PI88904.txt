APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR addresses the following issues:
   1.  For Version 11, Release 1, Version 11, Release 2, and
   Version 12, Release 1:
   When the product libraries are pre-allocated via a logon
   procedure, and the product is invoked with the
   LIBDEF(NO) option, the LIBDEFs still occur.
   2.  For Version 12 Release 1 only:
   When setting parameter 'Change Management database'
   to 'NO' and 'Enable CM on DB2 Admin Tool primary menu'
   to 'YES' during the customization process, the option
   'CM' appears on panel ADB2 'DB2 Administration
   Menu', which will result in SQLCODE = -204 /
   SQLCODEN204, because the CM objects do not exist:
   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -204, ERROR: >schema<.ADBCHG
    IS AN UNDEFINED NAME
    DSNT418I SQLSTATE = 42704
    SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
