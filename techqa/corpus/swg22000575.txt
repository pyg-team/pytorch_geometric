struts2; CVE-2017-5638 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is InfoSphere Information Server vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638 regarding Apache Struts 2? 

ANSWER
Information Server components do not package struts2 at all in any of the versions (i.e. v8.1, v8.5, v9.1, v11.3 and v11.5).

All these versions use struts1. 

IIS v8.7, v9.1, v11.3 and v11.5 has been upgraded from struts 1.2.8 to struts 1.2.9-sp3. 

Vulnerability tests have been run against the IIS admin console which is not vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638.

Also, WebSphere is not vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638 per this technote:
