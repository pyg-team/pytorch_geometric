   *                 user IDs with blank passwords                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When HOD Administrators create a new    *
   *                      user ID with a blank password or if an  *
   *                      existing user changes the password to   *
   *                      blank when AllowBlankPassword property  *
   *                      is missing in config.properties file,   *
   *                      a Jave exception is thrown, Null        *
   *                      pointer exception and the operation     *
   *                      fails.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Whenever there is no AllowBlankPassword property in the
   config.properties file, this property value was not getting
   set to the default value true and the code was failing to
   handle it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to set the property to default value of
   yes.
