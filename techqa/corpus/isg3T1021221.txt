QUESTION
 What are the main RTM services or processes running on RTM server 

ANSWER
The main RTM services are:
1) lsfpollerd:
is the master control daemon responsible for collecting the grid data from the LSF cluster. It periodically calls other grid pollers such as gridjobs, gridbhosts, gridbqueues which then collect information from LSF via API calls. The information collected by the grid pollers is stored in the RTM's MySQL database called 'cacti'.

2) licpollerd:
is a daemon for collecting license data. It will call the lmutil utility based on the license server configuration which is set by the administrator when he sets up a license server in the grid management 
Note this daemon can be stopped in case no license sever is configured in the cluster.

3) crond
Responsible for all scheduled tasks in RTM.

4) advocate:
is required for the execution of grid control commands sent through RTM web console. For example, applying new LSF configuration.

5) mysqld:
The MySQL database server daemon. The database stores the LSF cluster configurations and grid data, such as jobs, queues, users, hosts, etc..

6) httpd: 
is the web server. Provides access to RTM through your browser.


The status of the services can be checked using the following commands:

service lsfpollerd status
service licpollerd status 
service crond status 
service advocate status 
service mysqld status
service httpd status
All service commands should report running.

If any of the above services are down or unknown, RTM will not function properly
