APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We have taken the following steps when migrating a new snapshot
   to
   production
   
   1. Moved all in-flight instances to the latest snapshot
   2. Made the latest snapshot the default.
   
   Yet we see that some new instances get created against the old
   snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of BPM Express, BPM Standard, and     *
   *                  BPM Advanced.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When installing new snapshots and       *
   *                      migrating instances. The previous       *
   *                      snapshot is deactivated and archived,   *
   *                      and only one snapshot per process       *
   *                      application is active. New instances    *
   *                      will appear on the previous snapshot.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Running an exposed service by url/project page is causing old
   snapshots to activate. Snapshot would get activated by
   executing a favorite (taskless service). If that favorite
   belonged to a deactivated versioning context, it would cause
   an old snapshot to activate.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Introduces two new EJB paramaters for deactivated snapshots,
   those parameters are checked before listing snapshots.
   
   Install/Dependency information is available in the readme.txt
   on FixCentral. When the user goes to the download files page
   in FixCentral, the readme will be available with the fix
   package as a separate download
