QUESTION
 What is the correct configuration for the "Event monitoring remote path" for the DB2 Performance Expert (PE) software in my IBM Smart Analytics System 5600 environment? 


CAUSE
Some IBM Smart Analytics System 5600 environments are incorrectly configured with the DB2 Performance Expert event monitoring remote path set to the value "/pefs/evmfiles". When the event monitoring remote path is set to this value, NFS might be configured to mount the /pefs/evmfiles file system to all data nodes.

ANSWER
The correct configuration uses the local "/db2fs/<instance_name>/db2dump" file system for the remote path, where <instance_name> represents the name of the core warehouse instance. 

If your PE configuration does not display the configuration value "Event monitoring remote path = /db2fs/<instance_name>/db2dump", then you will need to change your PE configuration. If NFS is configured to mount the /pefs/evmfiles to all data nodes, you must also remove the NFS mount for the /pefs file system.

To change the PE configuration:
1. Log in to the management node as the Performance Expert instance owner.
2. Launch either the Performance Expert graphical user interface or the command-line console (peconfig -console). 
3. Set the value of the "Event monitoring remote path =" to /db2fs/<instance_name>/db2dump, where <instance_name> is the name of the core warehouse instance. 
4. Restart PE to update the configuration:
peconfig -restart

To remove the NFS mount for the /pefs file system:
1. Log in to the management node as the root user and remove pefs from /etc/exports.
2. Log in to each administration, data, and standby node as the root user and remove the pefs line from /etc/fstab.
