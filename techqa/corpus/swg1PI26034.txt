APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ProcessCPU statistic on the JvmStats MBean does not work
   properly when running on IBM Java 7 and later.
   .
   Enabling some trace groups can cause errors when running on Java
   7 and later.  For example:
   [ERROR   ] TRAS0033E: Runtime injection of detailed method trace
   failed for class
   com.ibm.ws.app.manager.internal.statemachine.ApplicationStateMac
   hineImpl with exception java.lang.ClassFormatError
   .
   Enabling some trace groups can cause errors when running on Java
   8 and later.  For example:
   [7/9/13 13:18:05:438 CDT] 0000001c
   ibm.ws.ras.instrument.internal.main.AlpineRuntimeTransformer E
   TRAS0033E: Runtime injection of detailed method trace failed for
   class com/sun/jmx/remote/util/ClassLogger with exception
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

   ****************************************************************
   The JvmStats MBean relies on some internal methods of the IBM
   JVM.  In Java 7, an internal refactoring of the JVM caused a
   method to be moved to a different class, which the Liberty
   runtime did not handle.
   The dynamic trace mechanism relies on class-rewriting.  The
   class rewriter incorrectly handled UNINITIALIZED stack entries
   in some cases, which resulted in an error when trace is enabled
   in those classes.
   The dynamic trace mechanism only has support for Java 7 classes.
   In some cases, JVM classes were being instrumented, which fails
   if Java 8 is used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The JvmStats MBean was adjusted to locate the internal JVM
   method using a more general mechanism.
   The dynamic trace mechanism was fixed to properly handle
   UNINITIALIZED stack entries.  It was also fixed to avoid
   attempting to process Java 8 classes.
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 8.5.5.4.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
