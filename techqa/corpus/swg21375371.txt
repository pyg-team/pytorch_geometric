Title: IBM Receive error when backing up profile during profile migration - United States

Text:
migrate; manageprofiles; full-qualified TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When backing up a WebSphere Business Monitor profile using the manageprofiles command, the command fails and reports the following error: 

INSTCONFFAILED: Cannot backup profile. 

CAUSE
This problem is caused by failing to provide the fully qualified path for the backup zip file as the value of the -backupFile switch for the manageprofiles command.
For example, the following command will cause an error because the fully qualified path is not provided:

./manageprofiles.sh -backupProfile -profileName WBMon01 -backupFile WBMon01.backup.zip



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must provide the fully qualified path for the .zip file as the argument to the -backupFile switch for the manageprofiles command. For example: 


./manageprofiles.sh -backupProfile -profileName WBMon01 -backupFile ./usr/migration/WBMon01.backup.zip

The following message should appear:

INSTCONFSUCCESS: Success: The profile backup operation was successful.
