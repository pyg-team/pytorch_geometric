   Abstract: ITCAMMA check boxes on Launchpad are incorrect when
   agent is already installed.
   
   Environment:
     Windows and Microsoft Apps Version 6.2.3
   
   Problem Description:
   ====================
   When ITCAMMA v622 for 64-bit OS is already installed, in basic
   installation the checkbox for IBM Tivoli Composite Application
   Manager for Microsoft Applications V6.2.2 for Windows on 64-bit
   AMD and Intel systems (x64) remains unchecked which allows it
   to check (install) for the installation of 64-bit agent through
   basic installation even if 64-bit agent is already installed.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   ======================
   The following products are needed to reproduce the errors

     5. verify whether the check box for IBM Tivoli Composite
   Application Manager for Microsoft Applications V6.2.2 for

   Expected Behavior:

   Microsoft Applications V6.2.2 for Windows on 64-bit AMD and
   Intel systems (x64) should be grayed out when 64bit agent
   already installed as in basic installation we can not upgrade or
