APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Versions of a document may have different security applied. The
   export manifest correctly exports the version specific security
   information to xml. The import process appends the permissions
   of earlier versions to later versions of the document, so
   changes made to version security are lost during import.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Add a document to the object store using EM or Workplace.
   Grant group 'testgroup' view access.
   2. Checkin a new version of the document. Remove 'testgroup'
   from the permissions of the new version.
   3. Examine the property page for each version and verify that
   testgroup appears in the access list for version 1 but not
   version 2.
   4. Add the document to the export manifest and export. Make sure
   the option to Export Security Permissions is checked
   5. Examine the xml export and verify that the correct
   permissions were exported for each version, with testgroup only
   included in version 1.
   6. Delete the document from the object store
   7. Import the document making sure Import Security when included
   in XML is checked
   8. Examine the property pages of each version and notice that
   testgroup has access to both versions of the document.
   9. Confirm that there were no errors recorded in the import log
   
   Actual Results:
   testgroup has access to both versions
   
   Expected Results:
   testgroup should only appear in the access list of version 1
