Text:
feature level; mkreplica; warning; 1238697 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote details why a warning message will appear if the VOB family feature level is lower than the feature level of the IBM® Rational® ClearCase MultiSite® installation when running multitool mkreplica -export | import on Microsoft® Windows®, UNIX® and Linux®. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The Feature Level of a VOB dictates what features and or enhancements are available when working in that database. 

A feature level is an integer that is incremented at each ClearCase release that introduces features that affect VOBs created in an earlier release. The purpose of raising feature levels is to make all features in a release available to users of the VOB that was created in the earlier release.

As of the following patches:

7.0 

ClearCase Windows, UNIX and Linux 7.0.0.0-RATL-RCC-IFIX01 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24012808&rs=984] 

2003.06.00 Clearcase Windows clearcase_p2003.06.15.NT-2006C [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24011496] ClearCase UNIX and Linux multisite_p2003.06.00-14 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg24009632] 


... a warning message has been added to indicate if the VOB family feature level is lower than the feature level of the ClearCase MultiSite installation on the server. 

When you run multitool mkreplica on a VOB whose family feature level is lower than the default feature level of ClearCase MultiSite installed on the VOB server, you will see this warning: 

The family feature level for this VOB is currently X. In order to take advantage of VOB feature level enhancements, you must raise the family feature level of this VOB. See the ClearCase MultiSite documentation for instructions. 


Note: The warning is informational only and does not prevent the command from running correctly. 


To learn more about raising the feature level of a VOB or VOB family using cleartool chflevel, refer to IBM Rational ClearCase Command Reference, or run cleartool man chflevel.
