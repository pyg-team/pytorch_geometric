Title: IBM PK73731: SYNDICATION DOES NOT RESTART GRACEFULLY AFTER A CRASH OF THE SYNDICATOR - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a syndicator crashes, it may be necessary to rebuild the
   subscriber in order for subsequent syndication to proceed
   correctly.
   There should be some message that a prior syndication did not
   complete correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Rebuild the syndicator after the subscriber does not run to a
   successful completion.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the syndicator becomes unresponsive during syndication the
   syndicator/subscriber pair can become out of sync.  This forces
   the need to perform a rebuild as an update in this state will
   not resync the servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  ensure WCM is stopped prior to server shutdown.  Perform a
   rebuild if this condition is encounered.
   
   
    
   
   

COMMENTS
 *  This has been addressed in a future PTF
