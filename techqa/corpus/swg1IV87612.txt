   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A previous fix (APAR LI78373 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LI78373]) fails to release back memory
   pinned by the JNI in an error case (for instance when cmsend
   passes a null). This could cause the Java garbage collector to
   run out of memory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been changed to release memory properly in this case.
