QUESTION
 How do you apply a fix pack to IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI) version 5.2.6.x if you do not have the IM_<OS>(.zip) files containing the IBM installation manager (IIM) install files from the ISBI media available? 

ANSWER
To apply a fix pack to ISBI 5.2.6 there is no need to install IIM again and you do not need the IM_<OS>(.zip). IIM had been installed during the upgrade to or installation of 5.2.6.x.


Per default you can find IIM (installed as non-root / non-Administrator) at ~/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse (Linux) or 
%USERPROFILE%\IBM\Installation Manager\eclipse (Windows)
