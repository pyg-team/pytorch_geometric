PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
This document describes how ReportNet and Cognos BI do locate images for use in PDF or HTML reports.

For example, why the image is not render in a PDF document in multiserver environments when the image is specified with a relative path. 

SYMPTOM
 

 Image is not render in a PDF document


CAUSE

There is a fundamental difference concerning the use of pictures between HTML and PDF. HTML reports only contain the path to the picture. In PDF, the pictures are embedded directly into the document.


ENVIRONMENT
 

IBM Cognos ReportNet 1.1 or IBM Cognos 8/10 BI


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

HTML Reports


 * 


PDF Reports 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  If a relative location has been specified (i.e. the URL starts with ..) then start at the webcontent directory in the file system and try to locate location and image. 
 * Example: 
    * The image URL is ..\samples\images\cognos.jpg 
    * ReportNet looks for c:\Program Files\Cognos\crn\webcontent\samples\images\cognos.jpg
   
   
 *  If an absolute location has been specified (i.e. the URL starts with anything other than ..), then try to locate the location and image in the bin directory of the file system 
 * Example: 
    * The image URL is samples\images\cognos.jpg 
    * ReportNet looks for c:\Program Files\Cognos\crn\bin\samples\images\cognos.jpg
      (The directory bin\samples\images does not exist by default. You may need to create this.)
   
   
 *  If the URL starts with \ then the root of the install drive will be used as the starting location. 
 * Example: 
    * The image URL is \samples\images\cognos.jpg 
    * ReportNet looks for c:\samples\images\cognos.jpg
      (The directory c:\samples\images does not exist by default. You may need to create this.)
   
   
 *  If the file has not been found, the ReportNet / Cognos BI process opens an HTTP connection to the specified URL and try to locate the image that way. Therefore, the correct gateway needs to be defined within Cognos Configuration of the Application Server.
