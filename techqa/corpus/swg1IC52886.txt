APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Specifying NO ALLSYMLINKS as suggested in the WebSphere MQ
   for HP NonStop Server V5.3 System Administration Guide results
   in the symbolic links not being copied. Removing this option
   results in the symbolic links being copied and the G volume
   remaining untouched.
     Unfortunately our implementation of MQ changed after the
   documentation was produced.
     You do need to set the ALLSYMLINKS option so that the
   var/mqm/G link is created.
     It is important to review the log for errors to make sure
   that the link is created correctly on the backup site and that
   it points to the correct location.  This should occur because
   MQ requires the same disk and OSS fileset configuration on both
   Primary and backup sites.
     The specific section in our documentation which is incorrect
   is as follows:
   Manual:  WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server V5.3 System
            Administration Guide (SC34-6625-00)
   Chapter: 15 Recovery and Restart.
   Section: Disaster recover.
   Topic:   Configuring WebSphere MQ, NonStop RDF, and AutoSYNC
            to support disaster recovery.
            -------------------------------------------------
           "The entire queue manager OSS directory structure
            var_installation_path/var/mqm/qmgrs/qmname.
            You must specify the absolute path name of the queue
            managers directory. Specify the NO ALLSYMLINKS
            option for this fileset to prevent AutoSYNC from
            attempting to synchronize the symbolic link
            (G directory) in the queue manager's directory
            to the NonStop OS queue manager's subvolume."
            ------------------------------------------------
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set ALLSYMLINKS option so that the var/mqm/G link is created
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
