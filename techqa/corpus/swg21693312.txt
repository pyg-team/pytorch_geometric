Title: IBM Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects IBM Security SiteProtector  (CVE-2014-8730) - United States

Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) padding vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack affects IBM Security SiteProtector System and IBM Security SiteProtector Appliance. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]

DESCRIPTION: 
Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
On each machine running a SiteProtector component or on the appliance, perform the following steps:


 1. Select the Start button > right-click Computer > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables... 
 2. Under System variables, add a new variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES with a value of 1. 
 3. Restart all the SiteProtector services including issDaemon.


On each machine running a X-press Update Server, perform the following steps: 

 1. Edit the file C:\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\conf\httpd.conf. 
 2. After line "SSLAttributeSet 445 1", insert a new line "SSLAttributeSet 471 1" 
 3. Restart the service SiteProtector Web Server.
