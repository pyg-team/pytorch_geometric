APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ICC provides the ability to monitor business processes (BPs)
   and then configure if you want to include them.  This allows
   you to define to monitor in ICC only what BP's you wish to
   monitor.  The architecture is that the system will by default
   monitoring everything but then ONLY exclude what you select to
   exclude.  This means that in essence you have to define what
   you want to exclude and the more that is excluded, the slower
   it performs as it must check the exclusion list at each monitor
   step.  Test showed evidence that excluding close to the maximum
   number of BP's will in fact slow down processing.
   
   This is a product enhancement request to have an ICC change so
   you can explicitly select what BPs to include (whitelist) or
   exclude (blacklist) without impacting performance.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   ICC Control Center Users
   
   Problem Description:
   ICC provides the ability to monitor business processes and
   define what business processes need to be excluded from the
   monitoring. The more that is excluded, though the slower it
   performs as it must check the exclusion list at each monitor
   step.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   ALL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution Summary:
   This is an enhancement to allow ICC to explicitly select what to
   include (whitelist) or exclude (blacklist) without impacting
   performance.  This enhancement is compatibile with ICC 6.1.1.0
   iFix01 and above.
   
   In ICC to enable the white list support customers will need to
   add an element named BP_BLACK_LIST, with a value of FALSE, to
   the engine.properties data, and then stop and restart ICC.
   Customers can make this change any time on ICC.  It won't take
   affect until ICC is restarted. Once customers have done that,
   and reconnect the ICC console, and look at the properties for
   the SI server, and specifically show the BPs being monitored,
   customers  will see that the selection list changed to allowing
   them to deselect the BPs that they do not want monitored.  With
   the white list approach (BP_BLACK_LIST FALSE), customers should
   just check the BPs they want monitored.
