ABSTRACT
 Using the backupConfig and restoreConfig utilities for Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (DWC) v9.1 at the General Availability (GA) level results in a broken DWC instance. 

CONTENT
ISSUE:
Restoring a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) configuration backup file for TDWC v9.1 GA instance results in the following error within DASH:

"CWLAA6003: Could not display the widget at this time, the widget's module may be being updated"

In DWC v9.1 GA, the scripts backupConfig and restoreConfig run without error and the WebSphere server process for the JazzSm profile starts without error. However, once authenticated in DWC's dashboard, the elements of the portfolio are not functional.

CAUSE:
The use of the restoreConfig utility to restore the WebSphere profile results in missing files under the following directory: <JazzSm>/profile/installedApps .

The backupConfig step does not backup files under <JazzSm>/profile/installedApps, but the restoreConfig utility overwrites the contents in installedApps if the contents differ from those found under <JazzSm>/profile/config. 


RECOVERY:
Uninstall and reinstall DWC v9.1 


PREVENTION:
* Avoid the use of the backupConfig and restoreConfig utilities with a DWC v9.1 GA instance.
