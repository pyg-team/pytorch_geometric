ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   Environment
   ===========
   ITCAM for WAS 6.1. FP04 DC (monitoring
    Portal servers v6.0.2.27 32bit Net deployment
    App servers v6.1.0.11 64bit Net deployment)
   ITCAM for WAS 6.1. FP04 TEMA
   
   
   Problem Description
   ===================
   After a number of hours the ITCAM for WAS TEMA agent stops
   sending data to the TEP server and the workspaces appear blank.
   .
   Increasing the heap size allows the TEMA to run for longer but
   does not prevent this issue occurring
   .
   When the problem is seen, the TEP workspace is blank (greyed
   out) and if the mouse is clicked on any of the workspaces the
   hourglass appears and eventually times out
   .
   If a netstat -an is run on the machine running the TEMA there
   are many connections on port 63335 (listening port for the TEMA
   agent) in CLOSE_WAIT status
   .
   This issue seems to happen more frequently when there is a high
   number of requests being sent to the TEMA agent (e.g. from a WAS
   Portal Server)
   .
   A fix from APAR PK86370 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK86370] to throttle the number of requests sent
   from the DC to the TEMA slows the time the TEMA crash takes to
   occur but does not prevent it
