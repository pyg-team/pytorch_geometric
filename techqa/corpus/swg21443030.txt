Title: IBM Restrict Execution Unit (XU) visibility to cluster members on a WebSphere Application Server node - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can the Rule Execution Server (RES) XU usually installed on node level be available only to a specific server in a cluster? 

CAUSE
In WebSphere Application Server, a resource adapter (RAR file) can be installed only at the node level, which makes its J2C connection factories available to all servers on the node. When clustering RES, it may be preferable to have the XU visible only to the servers that belong to a particular cluster and not all servers on the node.

ANSWER
 

 1. Install the XU RAR on each node of the XU cluster by following step 1-4 in the installation documentation under section Deploying the XU RAR on WebSphere Vx.x .
    Note: Do NOT create connection factory for the XU at the node level. 
 2. Choose the scope as cluster and Make a copy of the XU by clicking on "New" ( instead of "Install RAR") in the Resource Adapter main page in the Websphere Application Server console. The "Archive path" for this new resource adapter should point to a file such as ${CONNECTOR_INSTALL_ROOT}/jrules-res-xu-WAS7.rar 
 3. Create connection factory on the XU copy by following the installation steps (5-7) in the documentation. 
 4. Restart the WebSphere Application Server.


Now the connection factory required by the XU to connect to the RES datasource is available only on the servers in the cluster.
