Title: IBM Configuring the IBM Docs Integration plug-in - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The IBM Docs Integration plug-in is included with IBM Content Navigator. To use it, you must configure the plug-in, install the IBM Docs add-on, and update your custom menus. 

CONTENT
This information applies to IBM Content Navigator, Version 2.0.3 Fix Pack 3 and later releases. 

Before you begin
IBM Connections Docs requires IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager and FileNet Collaboration Services. Install IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager and FileNet Collaboration Services by using the installer for IBM Content Navigator. You must use the same configuration profile and point to the same Content Engine or Content Platform Engine component that you specified for IBM Content Navigator. Then, update the following properties files: 

 * For IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager, edit the cmis.properties file and set the following properties:  * enableTeamspaceAwareness=true 
    * filterHiddenProperties=false
   
   
 * For IBM FileNet Collaboration Services, edit the fncs-sitePrefs.properties file and set the following property:  * enableSharedDrafts=true
   
   


If you configure IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager to store document content, you can install IBM Connections Docs without IBM Connections. However, to avoid installation errors, if you install IBM Connections Docs without IBM Connections, you must disable installation of the features that depend on IBM Connections. To disable installation of these features, when you use IBM Installation Manager for IBM Connections Docs, go to Install Packages > Features and clear the following options:  * Viewer server and extension 
 * Docs extension


If you install IBM Content Navigator in a WebSphere Application Server environment, disable the security integration property for session management. If you do not disable the security integration property, a web client connection error message is displayed when you log out of IBM Content Navigator after you edit a document in IBM Connections Docs. To disable security integration, log in to the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, go to Application servers > server_name >Session management and clear the option for Security integration. 

About this task 
The IBM Docs Integration plug-in enables you to perform the following tasks:  * From IBM Content Navigator, open a document that is stored in an IBM FileNet Content Manager repository, edit the document in IBM Connections Docs, and check in a new version of the document to the repository. 
 * From IBM Content Navigator, create and collaborate on a new document in IBM Connections Docs, and then save the document in an IBM FileNet Content Manager repository.


You can also add document templates to the IBM Docs Integration plug-in. The document templates are applied when you create a new word processing document, spreadsheet, or presentation. The following table shows the valid file extensions and MIME types for document templates: 

Document type Valid file extensions Valid MIME types Word processing documents  *  .docx 
 *  .ott 
 *  .odt 
 *  .doc

 * application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document 
 * application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text-template 
 * application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text 
 * application/msword 
 * text/plain 

Presentation documents  *  .pptx

To enable the IBM Docs Integration features, you must configure the IBM Docs Integration plug-in, install the IBM Docs add-on for your repository, optionally add document templates, and update your custom menus. 

Procedure 
To configure the IBM Docs Integration plug-in: 
 1. Open the administration tool in the IBM Content Navigator web application, and click Plug-ins > New Plug-in. 
 2. Enter the JAR file path for the IBM Docs Integration plug-in. 
    The default JAR file path for the IBM Docs Integration plug-in class on Windows is C:\Program Files\IBM\ECMClient\plugins\docsPlugin.jar. 
 3. Click Load. 
 4. For the IBM Docs Server URL, enter the URL for the server where IBM Connections Docs is installed. By default, the URL has the following format: http://local_host:port_number/server_name/context_root. The context root is the value that is specified for IBM Connections Docs in the WebSphere Application Server configuration settings. 
 5. For each repository that you want to use with IBM Connections Docs, install the add-on for the repository:  *  Select the repository from the drop-down list, and click Connect. Enter a repository administrator user name and password, and click Log in. After connecting to the repository, click Install Addon. 
    
    
 6. Optional: Specify document templates to apply when you create a new document with IBM Connections Docs. Initially, no document template is specified, and you can add a template. After you add a template, you can either change the template or remove it.


Results 
The following menu actions are added to IBM Content Navigator:  *  Edit in IBM Docs New Document New Spreadsheet New Presentation 


The following menus are added to IBM Content Navigator:  *  Default IBM Docs Plug-in Banner Tools Context Menu Default IBM Docs Plug-in Favorite Item Context Menu Default IBM Docs Plug-in Item Context Menu Default IBM Docs Plug-in Teamspace Item Context Menu 


These menus contain the existing default menu actions, plus the new menu actions for IBM Docs. 

The following toolbars are added to IBM Content Navigator:  *  Default IBM Docs Plug-in ContentList toolbar Default IBM Docs Plug-in Global toolbar Default IBM Docs Plug-in Teamspace ContentList toolbar 


These toolbars contain the existing default menu actions, plus a New Document drop-down list that contains the new menu actions New Document, New Spreadsheet, and New Presentation. 

What to do next 
The new menus and toolbars replace the corresponding menus and toolbars for the default desktop. However, to enable the new menu actions for a custom desktop, edit the custom desktop and replace the corresponding menus and toolbars in your custom desktop with the IBM Docs Plug-in menus and toolbars. Or to enable the IBM Docs menu actions for a custom menu, edit the custom menu and select the new menu actions from the list of available actions and move them to the list of selected actions. 

Tip: When you enable the IBM Docs Integration plug-in, IBM Content Navigator creates the ClbIBMDocsState property. The ClbIBMDocsState property is not automatically indexed. If you want to improve the performance for adding default templates and creating new documents, create a database index for the ClbIBMDocsState property. 

Minimum required versions:  * IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3.3 
 * IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager V2.0.3.3 
 * IBM FileNet Collaboration Services V2.0.3.3 
 * IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine V5.2.1
