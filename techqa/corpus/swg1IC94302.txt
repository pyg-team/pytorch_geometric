APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SAP transaction events are not being removed from the broker's
   transaction ID (TID) store when a message flow processing
   error occurs.
   
   This causes a build up of WebSphere MQSeries messages on a
   broker internal queue called SYSTEM.BROKER.ADAPTER.PROCESSED.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus 9.0
   and the SAP input node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When a broker SAPInput node receives input from a SAP server,
   the transaction is stored as an event in a persistent TID
   (Transaction ID) store.
   The broker TID store persists events on a WebSphere MQSeries
   queue called " SYSTEM.BROKER.ADAPTER.PROCESSED".
   
   The broker persists failed transactions in the TID store, so
   that they can be recovered later by the SAP server. Failed
   transactions should only be persisted in the case where the IDOC
   or BAPI message is part of a batch of related messages.
   
   However, failed transactions are also persisted for single input
   messages. In cases where the SAP server does not receive error
   notification for the failed transaction, these events will not
   be recovered and remain in the TID store.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The broker no longer persists failed SAP transactions in its TID
   (Transaction ID) store if the input is not part of a batch of
   IDOC or BAPI messages.
