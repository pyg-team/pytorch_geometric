   if one opens two Browser sessions from one host using the same
   User/Password login against a single GUIServer into two
   separate ImpactServers in two separate Clusters where DataTypes
   have the same name in both ImpactServers and click to open/edit
   one DataType in one Browser, swap to the other Browser to
   open/edit a DataType with the same name one could find the
   DataType that opens is from the other ImpactServer.
   Essentially the response to a request is sent to the active
   Browser with the same connection details.
