APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR covers changes to the WebSphere MQ Queue Manager to
   disallow the configuration of SSLv3 CipherSpecs on new Queue
   Managers created after the application of this change.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users wishing to use SSL/TLS to secure communication over MQ
   channels.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Once this change is applied, any queue managers created will
   disallow the use of the following CipherSpecs on channel
   definitions associated with the queue manager:
   
     AES_SHA_US
     RC4_SHA_US
     RC4_MD5_US
     TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US
     DES_SHA_EXPORT1024
     RC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024
     RC4_MD5_EXPORT
     RC2_MD5_EXPORT
     DES_SHA_EXPORT
     NULL_SHA
     NULL_MD5
     FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
     FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   
   Attempting to use or configure one of these CipherSpecs will
   result in one or more of the following messages in the queue
   manager error log: AMQ8242, AMQ9616, AMQ9635.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To override this restriction, set the environment variable
   "AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE" to the value "TRUE" in the environment used
   to start the queue manager
   
   Alternatively, add the following entry to the SSL stanza of the
   queue manager's qm.ini file:
       AllowSSLV3=y
   
   
   Once this change is applied, queue managers using GSKit 8 will
   have the GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES functionality enabled by
   default. To override this, set
   GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_FALSE in the environment used to
   start the queue manager.
