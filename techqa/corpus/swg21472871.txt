QUESTION
What is the minimum set of applications needed to run IBM WebSphere Portal V7.0.0.x? How can you disable or uninstall extra applications that are not in use? 

This technote provides detail about what applications should run to enable WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.x to function correctly and how to safely disable applications that are not in use. 


ANSWER
Overview:
WebSphere Portal and IBM Web Content Manager (WCM) V7.0.0.x can be installed in a number of different configurations. In a default full installation including both Portal and WCM v7.0.0.1, a total of 117 applications (96 for base install) are installed. In many scenarios, it is not desirable to run all 117 applications simultaneously. 

WARNING about disabling applications:
This technote provides details on how to disable or uninstall applications in a Portal environment. Making such changes may have unintended side effects on the Portal environment. It is STRONGLY recommended that any changes first be applied in a sandbox or test environment where such changes and the potential for unintended side effects will have minimal impact prior to being attempted in a development, quality assurance, or production environment.

Limitations of IBM Support
IBM Support cannot recommend which specific applications should be disabled in a given environment. Each customer's environment is unique and any recommendations would require a detailed analysis and customization per environment. Such a customization is provided by IBM Services [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/services/] but not by IBM Support. The minimal set of applications is noted in this technote. Thorough testing should be done to ensure that disabling an application does not adversely affect other applications operating in the same Portal environment.

Method #1: Automatically disabling applications via developer mode
The "enable-develop-mode-startup-performance" configuration task will set the Auto-Start parameter in all applications to No except the applications listed in the wp.base_TargetMapExclList.properties file during a Portal server startup.

Please review the Portal 7.0 Wiki [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Changing_to_developer_mode_exp7] for detailed instructions and additional information.

Check related links section for Portal 8.0 and 8.5 instructions.

On a Portal 7.0.0.1 full and base content install, all applications EXCEPT the following will be disabled (82 applications will be disabled): 

wps
wps_theme
wps_scheduler
isclite
Personalization_Lists
Personalization_Workspace
PA_Login_Portlet_App
PA_WebScanner
content_j2ee
JavaContentRepository
wcm
ilwwcm-wcmsearchseed
wci
EphoxEditLive
TemplateLibrary_Servlets
PA_Selfcare_Port_App
UserProfileRESTServlet
MashupMaker_Integration
MashupCommonComponent
Dojo_Resources
Quickr_Document_Picker
AJAX Proxy Configuration
Live_Object_Framework
Feed_Servlet
PageBuilder2_Theme
feedReader
eventExplorer
websiteDisplayer
lwp_peoplefinder_war
odc
PA_WCM_Authoring_UI
PA_WCMLRingPortJSR286
SpellChecker

NOTE: This list can change between fixpack releases so review the wp.base_TargetMapExclList.properties file.

Method #2: Automatically disabling applications via Portal light mode
The "enable-portal-light-startup-performance" configuration task will set Auto Start to 'No' for all applications defined in the file wp.base_TargetMapInclList.properties to stop them from being auto started during Portal server startup.

Please review the Portal 7.0 Wiki [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_portal_light_mode_wp7] for detailed instructions and additional information.

Check related links section for Portal 8.0 and 8.5 instructions.

On a Portal 7.0.0.1 full and base content install, the following 36 applications will be disabled:

PA_Blurb
PA_MPagesandFavorites
PA_Properties
PA_Eecontentandlayout
PA_appearance
PA_Set_Permissions
PA_portletWiring
PA_ThemesAndSkinsMgr
PA_Resource_Manager
PA_TCustomizerPortApp
PA_Portlet_Manager
PA_Manage_Webservices
PA_Web
PA_Principals_Manager
PA_ResourceView
PA_Credential_Admin
PA_PolicyExplorer
PA_PolicyEditor
PA_PolicyEditorCA
PA_Settings
PA_URL_mapping
PA_UniqueNames
PA_Markups_Manager
PA_Clients_Manager
PA_Import_XML
PA_WCM_Admin
PA_FrequentUsers
PA_Tracing
PA_WPS_Welcome
PA_MageVirtualPortals
PA_TateCatalogPortApp
PA_PropertiesPortApp
PA_ParamConfig
PA_Roles
PA_ApplicationCatalog
#lwp_peoplefinder_war
PA_Policy_Status
#PA_Selfcare_Port_App
#TemplateLibrary_Servlets

NOTE: This list can change between fixpack releases, so review the wp.base_TargetMapInclList.properties file.

Method #3: Disabling applications manually
If it is not desirable to automatically disable 82 or 36 applications from auto-starting by using developer or light mode, it is possible to perform this task manually and disable each application one at a time. To perform this task of preventing the applications from auto-starting:

1. Start the WebSphere Application Server associated with WebSphere Portal(startServer.sh server1).

2. Log into the WebSphere Application Server administration console 
(https:/ /hostname.company.com:<WC_adminhost_secure>/ibm/console).

3. Go to Applications --> Application Types -> WebSphere Enterprise Applications --> Select individual application such as PA_Search_Center.

4. Click "Target specific application status" --> Check the checkbox --> click Disable Auto Start --> save the changes. 

5. Optional: Go back to the application listing and click Stop to stop the application that is currently running on the Portal server. 

Disabling vs. uninstalling applications:
In general, once applications are uninstalled, they can be very difficult to redeploy correctly, especially if the system was upgraded. Therefore, it is STRONGLY recommend that instead of uninstalling applications permanently, the applications should be disabled from auto-starting when the Portal server is started. The applications will take a minimal amount of storage space on the Portal system (and on the Deployment Manager if in a cluster) and will not be in use by the Portal system during startup or normal operations. 

Should business needs change, the applications will be available and can be enabled at a moment's notice. Further, if an application is uninstalled and there is a hidden dependency that is unknown, it can be painful to attempt to reinstall the application instead of simply restarting the application if it is disabled and not auto-started.
