Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Modeler error received connecting to MySQL Community edition.

Error:
Connections to MySQL Community Servers are not supported.
Please contact MySQL to obtain a MySQL Enterprise or Commercial version. 

CAUSE
Data Direct does not support MySQL Community edition. 
Information from Data Direct:

"The DataDirect Connect for ODBC drivers support 5.0 and later versions of MySQL Commercial or MySQL Enterprise servers. We do not support any of the MySQL Community servers. "


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modeler user can attempt to work with the drivers Data Direct refers them to, but Modeler has not been tested nor does it support the MySQL drivers. 
Better solution would be to use a supported database. 
Please refer to the SPSS Data Access Pack (SDAP) documentation included with the SDAP provided in your software download portal.
