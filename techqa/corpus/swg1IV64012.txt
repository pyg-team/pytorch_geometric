 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If customer has lots of message flows defined in the monitored
   Broker,
   KQI agent's java process may reach the max value of JVM heap
   size and
   throw an 'Out of Memory' exception.
   As a result, KQI agent is terminated unexpectedly and following
   error
   can be found in the agent log:
   Unknown msg recived: JVMDUMP013I Processed dump event
   "systhrow", detail
   "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError".

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If customer has lots of message flows defined in the monitored
   Broker, The heavy workload may cause two exceptions:
   1.KQI agent's java process may reach the max value of JVM heap
   and throw an 'Out of Memory' exception.
   2.The Broker CMP interface may take too long time to get data
   and throw an 'ConfigManagerProxyPropertyNotInitializedException'
   exception.
   As a result, kqi java process terminates unexpectedly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Have optimised kqi java code so that it can avoid those two
   exceptions when workload is heavy.
