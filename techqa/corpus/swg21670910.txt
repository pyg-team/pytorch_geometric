Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The MIF fails to process the inbound transaction when using Maximo standard object structure MXINVBAL to update items inventory balance for items with Issue Cost Type = FIFO.
This issue does not occur when importing items with Issue Cost Type = average. 

CAUSE
This is a data issue and occurs because the value of the attribute, COSTDATE, is missing. 

When importing inventory balance for Issue Cost Type = FIFO items, if the attribute COSTDATE has no value, then MIF will show these errors:

BMXAA5598E - Processing of an inbound transaction failed. The processing exception is identified in document 1.
BMXAA4214E - An unknown error has occurred.
Please contact your system administrator for assistance. Gather the logs from the <HOME> directory and determine where and why the error is thrown.
null


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure the file used to import the inventory balance update for items with Issue Cost Type = FIFO has the attribute COSTDATE with the correct date. 

If there is no value for this attribute in the importing file, you will get the above error.
