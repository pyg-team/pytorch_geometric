Title: IBM Unable to edit text within a dendogram output with Statistics 18 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After creating a dendogram, I found that I am not able to edit the Y-Axis labels that were generated using the /ID subcommand (syntax).
The syntax I am running is as simple as:
CLUSTER avail price cost calories 
/METHOD BAVERAGE 
/MEASURE=SEUCLID 
/ID=beer
/PRINT SCHEDULE 
/PLOT DENDROGRAM.

Editing the dendogram, does not allow me to change the size of the font of my case labels. This is a big issue as some labels are too large and are left blank, which makes my dendogram appear to be incomplete.

I've run the same procedure in PASW Statistics 17.0.2 and did not encounter this problem. I was able to change the font, size etc of my labels without issue. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and has been resolved in the 18.0.1 patch. Please download and install this patch in order to resolve this problem.
SPSS would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused
