Title: IBM Not able to edit reports if Internet Explorer 11 is used - United States

Text:
IE11 TROUBLESHOOTING

PROBLEM
Reports are successfully run. Opening the report in the Edit Mode displays an error message saying that the specification is invalid.

This problem occurs with the Internet Explorer 11 only. Chrome and Firefox both open the report in edit mode.

SYMPTOM
This document does not contain a valid report specification.

Reason:
The namespace prefix is not allowed to start with the reserved string "xml".

URL:


Line:
8820

Character:
15

Source:

<XMLAttribute xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" output="no" name="RS_dataType" value="3"/>
--------------^


CAUSE
The report was created by using Microsoft Edge and Queries copied inside the Queries Pane

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" code is found in the report specification

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Removing the xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" code manually from the report specification.

As Microsoft Edge is currently not a supported browser, it should not be used to create new reports.
