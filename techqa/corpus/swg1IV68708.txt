   values currently available to set RRT "Last Run Status"
   attribute
   
   - correct the RRT_Playback_Overrun situation formula, currently
   wrong with :
   *IF *VALUE RRT_Robotic_Playback_Status.Last_Run_Status *EQ
   OVERRUN
   
   good one :
   *IF *VALUE RRT_Robotic_Playback_Status.Current_Run_Status *EQ
   OVERRUN

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PROBLEM SUMMARY
   ***********************************************************
   * fixing in Situation editor the possible values listed for RRT
   "last run status" attribute, and correct the
   RRT_Playback_Overrun situation formula
   **********************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   1) In the TEP - the RRT_Playback_Overrun situation formula is :
   *IF *VALUE RRT_Robotic_Playback_Status.Last_Run_Status *EQ
   OVERRUN. It should be instead :
   *IF *VALUE RRT_Robotic_Playback_Status.Current_Run_Status *EQ
   OVERRUN ?
   
   2) Also, when you use the ITM TEP Situation editor, and
   add/change the attribute
   RRT_Robotic_Playback_Status.Last_Run_Status
   you can select a list of potential values for Last_Run_Status
   attribute, which are :
   Complete,Error,Failed.Idle,None,Not Supported,Overrun, Queued,
   Timeout
   So this list is partly incorrect
   
     *************************************************************
