APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using LDAP, if LTPA token times out the device is not
   aware of that and keeps running without warning users. It
   causes records created on device will never be synchonized to
   server (they will keep as local records forever).
   
   
   On MobileFirst trace you'll see errors:
   - SECJ0371W: Validation of the LTPA token failed because the
   token expired with the following info: Token expiration Date:
   Thu Sep 28 12:11:00 BRT 2017, current Date: Thu Sep 28 14:31:30
   BRT 2017 Token attributes:  port=XXX,
   username=user:defaultWIMFileBasedRealm/uid=wasadmin,o=defaultWIM
   FileBasedRealm, hostname=HOSTNAME.
   
   - authLogout() HTTP STATUS: 401 [Unauthorized]
   
   And you may see error 500 on device logs.
