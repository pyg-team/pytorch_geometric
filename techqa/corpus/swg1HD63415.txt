COMMENTS
 *  Incident Diagnosis
   The exported XML data is not created from Filtering
   result.
   Correct Application
   There are 2 different xml files that exists.
   .
   Have a look to the CATIA documentation (R18):
   Product Synthesis
   DMU Space Analysis
   Second
   Exporting Clash Results and Geometry in
   XML format
   First XML format type and Second
   XML format type.
   .
   In the section First XML format type,
   Filtering Clash Results:
   .
   "Any filters applied to the results in the dialog box
   are taken into account so you can use the filters to
   export only pertinent results"
   .
   In the section Second XML format type, have a
   look to Filtering clash results:
   .
   "If you choose to export clash results to a single
   large XML file (Federated XML output check box
   cleared), you can sort the display of computation
   results in the file. A Filter options entry under
   Computation Result lets you do so."
