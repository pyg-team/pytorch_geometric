APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HL7 v2.x response messages are being rejected by the
   HL7DFDLOutput node, regardless of their Acknowledgment Code, if
   they are of a type other than an ACK Acknowledgment, such as an
   ORR Order Response or an RSP Response (as defined in the MSH.9
   Message Type field).
   
   This APAR alters the node so that it will accept responses
   which are valid HL7 v2.x messages that also contain an 'AA'
   Acknowledgment Code.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack v4.0 that
   use the HL7DFDLOutput node to receive messages other than those
   of type ACK (Acknowledgment).
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64 platform, Windows on x86-64 platform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   HL7 v2.x response messages are being rejected by the
   HL7DFDLOutput node, regardless of their Acknowledgment Code, if
   they are of a type other than an ACK Acknowledgment, such as an
   ORR Order Response or an RSP Response (as defined in the MSH.9
   Message Type field).
   
   This APAR alters the node so that it will accept responses which
   are valid HL7 v2.x messages that also contain an 'AA'
   Acknowledgment Code.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If the response message received by the HL7DFDLOutput node is
   one which conforms to one of the message types described in HL7
   DFDL model deployed alongside the node, and the message contains
   an 'AA' acknowledgement code value in the MSA.2 Acknowledgment
   Code field, then the HL7DFDLOutput node will no longer reject
   it.
