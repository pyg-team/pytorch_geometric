APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0.0.1 and a Collaboration
   and Deployment Services environment. You also installed a C&DS
   Enterprise View driver (C&DS EV) to import a database into
   Statistics.
   The connection to the database and the driver works fine but
   when you paste syntax for the import you see wrong syntax
   generated on SQL subcommand and the FROM clause. For example you
   see
   FROM .SPSS_PEV.[employ] instead of
   FROM SPSS_PEV.employ as table name.
   
   So the issue is that there is an additional dot before
   SPSS_PEV.[employ].
   The second issue is that the EV driver can not parse this
   statement, because there are brackets for table name "employ"
   pasted.
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. As a workaround
   remove the brackets for employ and the extra dot before the
   table name. Then the  SQL can be parsed and you can import the
   database table into Statistics.
