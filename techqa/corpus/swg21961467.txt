Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GNU glibc affect IBM Security Network Protection (CVE-2013-7423, and CVE-2015-1781) - United States

Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The GNU glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in glibc used with IBM Security Network Protection. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the writing of DNS queries to random file descriptors under high load by the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. 

CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100647 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100647] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


CVE ID: CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781] 

DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the gethostbyname_r() and other related functions. By sending a specially-crafted argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system elevated privileges or cause the application to crash. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102500 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102500] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
