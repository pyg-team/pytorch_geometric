ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create a business object variable in the main track and
   later create a new track in which you make changes to the
   business object variable, like adding a new parameter or
   removing some of the existing parameters, you notice that these
   changes are not reflected in the new track when you debug a
   client-side human service that contains the modified business
   object variable.
