APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a particular syndication event goes active, and for
   whatever reason the subscriber/syndicator is having problems
   contacting each other, the event gets marked as stale, and
   syndication times out
   and completes resulting in a bad synchronisation run in that
   event. This may cause both machines to be out of sync and
   subsequent syndications to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Added the ability to acknowledge syndicator/subscriber timeouts
   and restore the states to prior the timeout. This will resend
   those items which may have been missed earlier again until
   a confirmination that those items have been processed has been
   acknowledged
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Syndication events between two servers can timeout due to poor
   network configuration or extreamly large load activity resulting
   in a possible synchronisation issue between the two servers.
   When a particular syndication event goes active, and for
   whatever reason the subscriber/syndicator is having problems
   contacting each other, the event gets marked as stale, and
   syndication times out
   and completes resulting in a bad synchronisation run in that
   event. This may cause both machines to be out of sync and
   subsequent syndications to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added the ability to acknowledge syndicator/subscriber timeouts
   and restore the states to prior the timeout. This will resend
   those items which may have been missed earlier again until
   a confirmination that those items have been processed has been
   acknowledged
