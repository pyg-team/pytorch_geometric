TFIM silent installation PureJavaProductServiceImpl$DiskSpaceCheck TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to silently install TFIM using a response file will fail on WebSphere Application Server v7.0.0.37 or later with warning message "Checking required disk space requires file service native support.". 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to install TFIM silently on WAS 7.0.0.37 or later fixpack level the installation process will fail with messages observed such as:

CAUSE
The Installer code that TFIM uses is not compatible with the updated Java SDK that WAS fixpack 37 and later provides.

ENVIRONMENT
This problem may be experienced when attempting to install TFIM on the following WAS build levels:
WAS 7.0.0.37 & higher
WAS 8.0.0.10 & higher
WAS 8.5.5.4 & higher


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The silent installation of TFIM on WAS v7 should be performed when WAS is at fixpack level 27 or earlier, and once installed, WAS may be updated to a later fixpack level if required.

Alternatively, the TFIM installation may be performed interactively on WAS 7.0.0.37 and later by using the workaround demonstrated in https://youtu.be/nw5pE9cTs50 [https://youtu.be/nw5pE9cTs50].
