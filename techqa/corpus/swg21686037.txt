 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM PureData™ System for Transactions. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6271 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error when evaluating specially-crafted environment variables passed to it by the bash functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7169 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96209 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96209] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7186 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7186]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96237 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96237] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7187 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7187]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an off-by-one-error when handling deeply nested flow control constructs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96238 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96238] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6278 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to the parsing of user scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
