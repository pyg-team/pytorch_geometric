Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Quick Start console for a deployment environment in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) seems to freeze, then eventually fails with an error message. There is no option to stop the deployment environment. 

SYMPTOM
When you start the Quick Start console for a deployment environment and then click "Start the deployment environment:" 

 1. The screen shows "Checking system applications status..." and then freezes for more than ten minutes. 
 2. The screen shows "Checking system application status failed." 


CAUSE
This problem occurs if you have disabled HTTP in your environment to improve security. After it starts the deployment environment, the Quick Start console checks the status of applications using HTTP. If your environment uses only HTTPS, it does not find the applications even if they are running.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The failure always occurs and does not mean that the deployment environment was not started. 


To check that the deployment environment was started correctly: 

 1. Open the WebSphere Application Server administrative console from the Quick Start console. 
 2. Under Servers > Deployment Environments, click the name of your deployment environment. 
 3. Click the name of each cluster and make sure that all the clusters are running.


To stop the deployment environment:  1. In the administrative console, click Servers > Deployment Environments. 
 2. Select your deployment environment name and click Stop.
