ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With an Instances widget and at least one other widget on the
   same page in Business Space, if a widget besides the Instances
   widget is in the maximized state at the time the page is loaded,
   the page fails to render properly; a red 'X' icon is displayed
   at the top of the page, with the following error (displayable
   by clicking on the 'X'):
   
   com.ibm.bspace.common.util.widget.BSpaceGeneralHelper; Method:
   onSizeChanged() Error Details: Invalid argument.
   
   The error above has been observed with Internet Explorer as the
   browser.  With Firefox as the browser, the red 'X' / error may
   not occur, but the Instances widget may not be displayed at all.
