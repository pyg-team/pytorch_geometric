PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Which Oracle NLS_CHARACTERSETS are supported by COGNOS? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
CM-SYS-5124 Content Manager cannot start because the content store database character set is not supported 

Applies To: 
Cognos 8 BI Cognos Connection - 8.1 
Cognos 8 BI Install and Config - 8.1 
Cognos ReportNet - 1.02 
Cognos ReportNet - 1.1 
Cognos ReportNet - 1.1MR2

Description: 
Tables in an Oracle Database Content Store are not created when the ReportNet Service is started. 
The following error message is displayed: CM-SYS-5124 Content Manager cannot start because the content store database character set is not supported. 
CM-SYS-5129 The content store database server uses the character set US7ASCII. 
CM-SYS-5128 The content store database client uses the character set US7ASCII. 

Solution: 
In SQL Plus, determine if the database is Unicode by typing the following Select statement: select * from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS The result should return NLS_CHARACTERSET of UTF-8 or UTF-16, or AL32UTF8 or ALI6UTF16, or not unicode. 

If this is not the case, recreate the Oracle database with one of these character sets as follows: 
1. Open SQL Plus 
2. Issue the following command: select * from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS; 
3. Make sure the NLS_CHARACTERSET is one of the following: {UTF-8 or UTF-16, or AL32UTF8 or ALI6UTF16, or not unicode} 
4. If the character set is different, create a new Oracle instance with the correct character set. *
