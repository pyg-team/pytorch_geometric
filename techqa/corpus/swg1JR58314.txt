LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A cumulative fix will be available for Integration Designer
   V8.5.7.
   
   This cumulative fix
   
   -sets Integration Designer projects to Java 1.7 if they aren't
   already set to that. Specifically, it will set the server
   runtime environment, project facets, and Java compiler level for
   each project in the workspace to Java 1.7.
   
   -introduces IBM Process Center V8.6 and IBM Process Server V8.6
   server types. These server types are provided as a convenience.
   Because the WebSphere Application Server level hasn't changed,
   the V8.5.7 and V8.6 versions of the server types are
   interchangable, which means you can use either server type to
   connect to an 8.5.7 or 8.6 Process Center or Process Server. The
   only significant difference between the server types is the name
   used to identify them. Note that there is no new version of the
   IBM Process Server on Process Center server. As with the other
   server types, the existing server version will work with a V8.6
   online Process Server.
   
   -does not update an existing IBM Process Server instance in the
   Servers view. If the unit test environment has been upgraded to
   V8.6, you may rename the existing Process Server instance to
   reflect the different server level, or you can create a new IBM
   Process Server V8.6 in the Servers view.
   
   -updates an existing IBM Process Center by changing the version
   name to 8.6.
