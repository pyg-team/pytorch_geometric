SUMMARY
 One of the cookies used for user authorization is missing the HTTPOnly Attribute which allows attackers leveraging a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability to obtain the cookie value and then perform a session hijacking attack. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-1994 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1994]
Description: IBM QRadar could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to set the HTTPOnly flag for the session cookie in SSL mode. By intercepting its transmission within an HTTP session, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to capture the cookie and obtain sensitive information.
