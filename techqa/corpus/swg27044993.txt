CONTENT
IBM updates this Fix list the first week of every month if there is a change to the APARs for this product. The fix list is available in two formats:

 * Fix list table
 * CSV file


Click on the Fixes by version document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008833] to see Fix lists for other version, release, and modification (VRM) levels of the currently supported CICS products including the CICS Explorer plug-ins. 



Fix list
Open APARs are at the top of the Fix list table followed by closed APARs, ordered by close date. There might be a few days after the APAR closes before the table and CSV file are updated with the close date and PTF(s).

Click on an APAR number in the Fix list table to display the APAR. You will need to enter your IBM ID and password when displaying open APARs.
