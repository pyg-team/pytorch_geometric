Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM Endpoint Manager for Security and Compliance - Security Compliance Analytics (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects IBM Endpoint Manager for Security and Compliance - Security Compliance Analytics. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

VRMF 
Remediation/First Fix 
IEM SCM – SCA 
1.6.139 
Upgrade to IEM SCM - SCA 1.7

Updates to SCM/SCA are available via fixlets in the IEM Console. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

1. On the IBM Endpoint Manager for Security and Compliance – Security Compliance Analytics server, edit the java.security file. 

Windows operating system
[INSTALLDIR]\java\jre\lib\security\java.security

Linux operating system
[INSTALLDIR]/java/jre/lib/security/java.security

where [INSTALLDIR] is the server installation directory

2. Add DH and DHE to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms line.

For example,
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH, DHE

3. Restart the server service. DH and DHE ciphers are disabled from the JDK for both inbound (HTTPS) connections and outbound (database, LDAPS) encrypted connections.
