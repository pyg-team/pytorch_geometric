 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed IBM SPSS on a Windows operating system. When I try and launch the product, I receive the error message

Loadlibrary failed with error 87: the Parameter is incorrect.

SPSS then does not launch. What is happening?


CAUSE
Atig6pxx.dll file on machine

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error is related to a specific file on your machine. Perform a search on your computer for a file called Atig6pxx.dll. This is an ATI graphics card file. Once you locate the file, right click on it and choose rename. Call it Atig6pxx.dll.bak. 



Now launch SPSS by right clicking on the SPSSicon and choose run as administrator to launch. SPSS should launch normally.
