QUESTION
 What is the difference between Node-Locked and Floating/Server license file?


ANSWER
The difference between Node-Locked and Floating/Server license file: 

Node-locked license: 

 

A node-locked license key is for use on one computer, and is tied to that computer. You do not need to run a license server if you are using a node-locked license. 

 

An example of a node-locked license key is given below: 

 

 * 
   VENDOR telelogic
 * FEATURE DOORS telelogic 2008.1231 31-dec-2009 uncounted \ 
 * 1234567890ABCDEF1234 VENDOR_STRING=T99-12345 
 * HOSTID=DISK_SERIAL_NUM=12341234
   




 

Floating or Server or Network license: 

 

A floating license system allows users on a network to check out individual licenses from a commonly shared set. Floating license keys contain the hostname and hostID of the IBM Rational License Server TL. 

The license manager daemon and vendor daemon must be running on the license server whose hostname and hostID are specified in the license key. 

When a user quits an application, all licenses used during that session are returned to the pool of available licenses. 

 

An example of a floating license key is given below: 

 

 * 
   SERVER myserver DISK_SERIAL_NUM=12341234 19353
 * VENDOR telelogic 
 * FEATURE DOORS telelogic 2008.1231 31-dec-2009 5 1234567890ABCDEF1234 \ 
 * VENDOR_STRING=T99-12345
