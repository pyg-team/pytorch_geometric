APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using channel authentication feature of MQ Version 8 and
   trying to configure as described in the MQ Knowledge Center.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The MQ Knowledge Center contained contradictory information
   while describing CHLAUTH rules.
   
   The parameter CHCKCLNT should be at a minimum set to 'OPTIONAL'
   in order to use more stringent CHLAUTH rules, and this should
   have been reflected in the relevant section of the Knowledge
   Center.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR is used to correct the Knowledge Center, confirming
   that the designed behaviour is as follows:
   
    If you select NONE and the client connection matches a CHLAUTH
   record with CHCKCLNT REQUIRED (or REQDADM on platforms other
   than z/OS), the connection fails. You receive message AMQ9793 on
   platforms other than z/OS, and message CSQX793E on z/OS.
