APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.5, elements edited
   from a
   Variable Block (VB) Endevor dataset using enhanced edit are
   truncated.
   
   Problem happens if the VB dataset uses subscript in the symbolic
   of the TYPE
   dataset name.
   
   CARMAlog will show entries like:
   
   EndevorRAM: The Source Length from the TYPE definition is: 04092
   EndevorRAM: Getting the base dataset name from
   ->&C1EN(1,1).BASE<-
   EndevorRAM: Parsing Dataset name ->&C1EN(1,1).BASE<- for
   symbolic values.
   EndevorRAM: Part prior to symbolic variable is: -><-
   EndevorRAM: Resolve symbolic variable found starting at:
   ->C1EN(1,1).BASE<-
   EndevorRAM: Empty or Unrecognized Symbolic name found in dataset
   name:
   &C1EN(1,1).BASE
   
   RDz can handle &C1EN in the dataset name, but it does not handle
   &C1EN(1,1).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no known workaround at this time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: 01.RDz users who access the Endevor          *
   *                    repository using the IBM supplied RDz     *
   *                    Endevor RAM, and who edit or browse       *
   *                    elements that are of variable record      *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.In RDz, elements edited              *

   ****************************************************************
   01.The record format and length of the element was not properly
      determined in some cases, causing the wrong record length to
      be used when extracting the element for viewing in the
      editor.
   02.When debugging COBOL V4, where the listings include ASA
      control characters, the debugger appears to stop on invalid
      lines.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The RDz code was modified to properly get the record format
      and length of the element that is being edited.
   02.The Integrated Debugger engine was updated to correctly
      process the ASA control characters in the COBOL V4 listing,
      so that stepping functions as expected.
