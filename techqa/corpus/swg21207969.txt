Title: IBM DUPLICATE IP ADDRESS DETECTED IN THE NET errors using WebSphere Load Balancer - United States

Text:
high availability TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You see "DUPLICATE IP ADDRESS DETECTED IN THE NET" errors when using WebSphereÂ® Load Balancer in High Availability (HA) mode. 

CAUSE
"DUPLICATE IP ADDRESS DETECTED IN THE NET" is a normal occurrence when using WebSphere Edge Server load balancer in high availability (HA) mode. This phenomenon will happen whenever the two machines are synchronizing, for example, upon initial boot-up, when the heartbeats connect or when a failover occurs. For example (during a failover), once an "Active" HA partner, goes off-line and the heartbeat is broken, the "Standby" machine who is going 'Active' , runs the goActive script and aliases the cluster address(es) to it's interface card and that's when the duplicate IP show up. Shortly thereafter, this machine will send out a gratuitous arp (GRAT ARP) to the network to let everyone (primarily the Router) know that this machine now owns the cluster address. When this happens the duplicate error messages on the network, should be cleaned up. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is normal behavior, more importantly though, you may want to understand why the failover occurred. See this technote:
