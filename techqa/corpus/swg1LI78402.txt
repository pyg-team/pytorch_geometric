APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM API Management V3.0.4.0 a new feature was introduced:
   Securing UI access with SSL mutual authentication
   This gave users the ability to configure SSL mutual
   authentication to secure the transmission of data to the Cloud
   Management Console, API Manager, and Developer Portal user
   interfaces
   
   In the Cloud Management Console and API Manager, SSL profiles
   are used to secure transmission of data through web sites.
   SSL certificates guarantee that information you submit to web
   sites will not be stolen or tampered with.
   
   In some circumstances, when a valid p12 certificate is uploaded
   to the CMC to create a new SSL profile and the CMC, APIManager
   and/or portal are secured using this profile, when navigating to
   the address for this web interface, you many receive an error
   stating : Error code:ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Upload intermediates certs using mutual auth and Trustore
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   Securing UI access with SSL mutual authentication
   This gave users the ability to configure SSL mutual
   authentication to secure the transmission of data to the Cloud
   Management Console, API Manager, and Developer Portal user

   In the Cloud Management Console and API Manager, SSL profiles

   SSL certificates guarantee that information you submit to web
   sites will not be stolen or tampered with.
   
   In some circumstances, when a valid p12 certificate is uploaded

   and/or portal are secured using this profile, when navigating to
   the address for this web interface, you many receive an error
   stating : Error code:ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
   
   In this instance, the problem was occurring due to an encoding
   issue.
   The problem has been resolved and the certificate can
   successfully be used in an API Management topology.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is targeted for inclusion in IBM API Management V3.0.4.1
