APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The database configuration parameter, SHEAPTHRES_SHR, can be
   automatically configured by the Configuration Advisor via the
   AUTOCONFIGURE command. However, the recommendation for
   SHEAPTHRES_SHR is not shown in the output of the AUTOCONFIGURE
   command. In the case where AUTOCONFIGURE command is called with
   the APPLY option, the update on SHEAPTHRES_SHR to the
   recommended value actually takes place.
   
   Here's a sample output from running AUTOCONFIGURE on the CLP:

   If you don't see the last line shown above, then you are hitting
   this APAR.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It's advised to always leave SHEAPTHRES_SHR set to its default
   which is AUTOMATIC.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All DB2 Version 9.5 Fix Pack 5 servers on Linux, Unix, and   *
   * Windows platforms issuing the AUTOCONFIGURE command.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The AUTOCONFIGURE command is only expecting "n" DB CFG       *
   * parameters, but the actual number of parameters is "n+1".    *
   * SHEAPTHRES_SHR is the last parameter in the structure, thus, *
   * it's missed from the output.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to DB2 Version 9.5 Fix Pack 5 or see "Local Fix".    *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is first fixed in DB2 Version 9.5 Fix Pack 6 and all
   subsequent Fix Packs.
