QUESTION
 You want to change schema name for Reference Data Management (RDM) v11.5. You are wondering what need to be changed. 

ANSWER
You can not change schema name after installation. Re-install is required if schema is different. This is because schema can not be changed if there is table and data on it. So you will need to reinstall RDM and point it to the database with new schema name.
