 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL in Power Hardware Management Console contains multiple vulnerabilities (
CVE-2014-3569, CVE-2014-3570, CVE-2014-3571, CVE-2014-3572, CVE-2014-8275, CVE-2015-0204, CVE-2015-0205, CVE-2015-0206) 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2014-3569
Description: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols by the ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an unexpected handshake to trigger a NULL pointer dereference and cause the daemon to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99706 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99706] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3570
Description: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.600
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3571
Description: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572
Description: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-8275
Description: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204
Description: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0205
Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.
CVSS Base Score: 2.100
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0206
Description: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704] for more information
