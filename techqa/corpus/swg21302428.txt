QUESTION
 How do you determine the total scan time duration in IBM Security AppScan Standard? 

CAUSE
After completing a scan, you are not sure how or where to find information that shows how long the scan took to complete.

ANSWER
Currently, AppScan Standard does not contain a menu option that allows you to determine the scan duration. However, you can find it in the following ways: 

 * In ScanLog.log log
   The AppScan Scan Log, ScanLog.log, can be used to determine the duration of a scan. This file is found by default in: C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational AppScan\Logs.
   
   When the scan has completed, the scan duration can be found in the Scan Log from the following line once your scan has finished:
   
   [ScanFlow] Scan stopped; scan duration: 00:44:04.7812500 
   
   The timestamp, 00:44:04, indicates that the scan has run for 44 minutes and 4 seconds.


 * In scan XML file 
   You can find the scan duration by exporting the scan results to XML, then searching the file for the tag <TotalScanDuration>, which is usually near the start of the file.
