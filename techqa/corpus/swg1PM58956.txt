ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description&#65496;
   The reported environment was:
   All the LPARs in a Queue Sharing Group (QSG) were IPL'd.
   Afterwards, the MSTR and CHIN jobs all started and appeared to
   be working. However, shared inbound channels had problems. Any
   connection coming in using the QSG VIPA name hung if it was
   sent to the first queue manager up. If it was sent to one of
   the other QSG members first, it worked.  In the hang scenario,
   if the others queue managers then tried to start the shared
   channel, they got
   CSQX478E CSQXRCTL Channel <channel_name) is active  on
   <qmgr_id>, connection tag in use
   .
   Once the first queue manager up was stopped, everything worked
   fine. The queue manager was then restarted and worked fine also.
   .
   The channel hang was due to a deadlock. A channel was
   waiting for the XSCS semaphore as requested by routine
   rriInitSess. The DPRO that was holding the XSCS semaphore was
   waiting for the XSTA semaphore, requested by routine
   rriAddStatusEntry. The XSTA semaphore was held by a DPRO that
   was waiting to be dispatched on a particular dispatcher TCB.
   The DPRO running on that dispatcher TCB was currently in a
   WAIT, in CSQXLOCT, waiting for a conversion table to be loaded
   by the CSQXSUPR TCB. However, the CSQXSUPR TCB was in routine
   riiCheckChannels waiting for the XSTA semaphore. So, there was
   a deadly embrace.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix&#65496;
   Restart the channel initiator or entire queue manager that is
   suffering the deadlock.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Deadlock occurs between supervisor TCB  *
   *                      and dispatcher TCB. Channel initiator   *
   *                      commands are not processed and channels *
   *                      on the affected dispatcher will hang.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A timing window exists where it's possible for a channel to
   obtain the XSTA channel status table semaphore and yield control
   to another channel process on the same dispatcher TCB, which
   then requests a load of a data conversion table be performed by
   the supervisor TCB. The supervisor TCB is unable to process this
   load request as it is attempting to obtain the XSTA semaphore
   held by the first channel in order to process any channels in
   retry.
   
   Because the channel requesting the load of the conversion table
   does not correctly yield control back to the dispatcher code,
   the first channel is not given an opportunity to execute and
   therefore is unable to release its semaphore. This results in a
   deadly embrace between the dispatcher and supervisor TCBs.
   
   In addition, This fix addresses the same problem when conversion
   occurs as a result of specifying CONVERT(YES) on a Sender
   Channel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When waiting for a data conversion table to be loaded, a channel
   process will now correctly issue a dispatcher wait rather than
   an MVS wait to ensure that other channels running on the same
   dispatcher TCB are able to release any semaphores they are
   holding.
