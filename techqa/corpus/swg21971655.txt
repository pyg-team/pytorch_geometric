Title: IBM Viewing agent System and Health events in SiteProtector - United States

Text:
health; warning; unhealthy; check TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Where can you find System and Health related events in the SiteProtector Console? 

ANSWER
There are a couple places where you can see more information about System and Health related events in SiteProtector.

For Health related information, you can view the agent's Health Summary pane (right click the agent and go to Properties, the Health Summary is on the left). Here you can view agent messages, metrics, and the results of health checks that have been performed on the agent. Under Agent Messages, you can see Info Events (agent information events that appear as Info, Warning, or Error) and Application Artifacts (which directly effect the agent health).

For health checks configured to enter a warning or failed state, the information appears in the Health Summary as well as in the Notifications view. The Notifications view contains notifications from all of the Sites that are connected to your SiteProtector Console. To access the Notifications view, click the Notifications icon in the lower right of the SiteProtector Console.

If you see that the Notifications icon is animated, this means there are new notifications. Here you see new or recurring events appearing in bold. These notifications remain in the Notification view for 2 weeks before being purged.

Both System and Health related events can be seen in the Analysis view. However, these are typically classified as Informational Only. To see these events, first load your wanted view. Then, click the Filters button on the far right under the Data Filters section. Under Column Filters, click Observation Type. Under the Observance Types on the right side, enable Informational Only and click OK in order to see these System Events.
