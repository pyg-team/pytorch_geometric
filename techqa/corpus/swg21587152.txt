Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I connect to the InfoSphere DataStage Server using Windows Remote Desktop and issue the command LIST.READU EVERY from the Universe Shell to list the current active locks the result never shows any locks. 

CAUSE
This command requires the Remote Desktop Connection to run in console mode and with the session ID of 0.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open task manager, click the User tab and check the ID of the current session. If is not 0 then LIST.READU won't work.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem you can do one of the following:

A) Connect to the Engine using a telnet command such as
telnet hostname

OR

B) Start Remote Desktop using the /admin parameter. To do this follow these instructions: 




 1. Disconnect the remote session 
 2. From your client Issue the command (from Start->Run): 
    
    mstsc /v:<server> /admin
    
    where <server> is the hostname or ip address of the DataStage Server 
 3. Open Task Manager, click on User tab and confirm that the session ID is 0
