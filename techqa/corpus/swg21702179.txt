PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Import of ABAP transport for ITCAM agent for mySAP gives ABAP exception condition ITM-D_STAT_FILE_STATRECS_FRAME. 

SYMPTOM
If you import SAP agent transport, such as ABAP 710_00107U.ITM into SAP, the ABAP exception condition :"ITM-D_STAT_FILE_STATRECS_FRAME" or "ITM-ITM-ILED_STAT_FILE_READ_REMOTE" is raised, and import fails.


CAUSE
The SAP_COLLECTOR_FOR_PERFMONITOR standard job is not scheduled, and the statistical data of today doesn't exist. mySAP agent requires that the SAP statistics collection is working correctly on the SAP systems it monitors.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect the ABAP dumps. 
1. Logon to SAP system via SAP GUI. 
2. Run 'ST22' transaction code 
3. Double click on the ABAP dump. 
4. Click 'System' -> 'List' -> 'Save' -> Local File and then select HTML format 
5. The HTML document can be saved for further references. 



Some key indicators of problem seen in ABAP dump from import of 710_00107U.ITM are shown below.


Short text Exception condition "ITM-D_STAT_FILE_STATRECS_FRAME" raised. Error analysis A RAISE statement in the program "/IBMMON/SAPLITM6" raised the exception condition "ITM-D_STAT_FILE_STATRECS_FRAME". Information on where terminated Termination occurred in the ABAP program "/IBMMON/SAPLITM6" - in "POST_STAT_READ_COMPLETE". The main program was "/IBMMON/ITM_INSTALLER ". In the source code you have the termination point in line 1948 of the (Include) program "/IBMMON/LITM6TOP". The program "/IBMMON/SAPLITM6" was started as a background job. Job Name....... "RDDEXECL" Job Initiator.. "DDIC" 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use following steps to solve this problem.

1. Open the SAPGUI, logon the SAP R/3 System which is monitored by the mySAP agent.
2. Run the ST03 transaction code, expand the workload, <hostname><SAPSYSTEMNAME><SAPSYSTEMNUMBER> and Day sub­tree node, and make sure the day node includes the today sub­tree node.
3. Double click the today sub­tree node and make sure the statistical data of today can be displayed as below: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21702179&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21702179&aid=1] 

4. If there is no statistical data or no today subtree node, run SM36 TCode, and check the jobs. If "SAP_COLLECTOR_FOR_PERFMONITOR" is not scheduled in the standard jobs, then schedule it. 

5. On SAP R/3 systems, you must set the SAP system time zone to match the operating system time zone in order for SAP statistics to be collected with the correct time stamps. You must make this change in order for the mySAP agent to successfully collect data. See SAP Note 926290 located in the SAP Support Portal for more information on this problem.
Note: If the statistical data of today exists, but there are still some ABAP dumps about ITM-ITM-ILED_STAT_FILE_READ_REMOTE, follow the steps below, to avoid those ABAP dumps.
A. Logon SAPGUI and run the SE16 transaction code
B. Input the /IBMMON/ITM_CNFG as the table name, and insert a parameter STATFILE_DUMPS with NO as its char value.
