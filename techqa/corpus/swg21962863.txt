Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
I am being prompted for a password if I try to login via ssh to the other host, even if I am using ROOT account already. 
How do I fix this issue? 
How do I setup an ssh passwordless connection for ROOT account?


SYMPTOM
When performing ssh using root account between the 2 hosts of a PDA appliance, the system asks for a password.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. On Host 1, change directory to /root/.ssh 

 

 *

2. Using 'cat' or 'more', view one of the generated keys already in place: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3. On Host 2, backup the file - /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 

4. On Host 2, using an vi editor, edit the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and copy the contents of the file you viewed in step # 2. 

5. From Host 1, you should now be able to ssh login to Host 2 without being prompted for a password 

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 but swapping the roles of Host 1 and Host 2 to enable passwordless connections from Host 2 to Host 1.
