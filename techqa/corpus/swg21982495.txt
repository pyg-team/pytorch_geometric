Title: IBM Workplace XT installation fails when usng UNC name for the shared configuration directory - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using a UNC name for the shared configuration directory under Windows 2012 Server, Workplace XT 1.1.5 Fixpack 2 IFix 2; installation reports the following error:

Unable to delete <UNC share name>\\Config\\WebClient\bootstrap.properties : ServiceException: (error code = -30019; message = "The specified path is invalid." 

SYMPTOM
In the installation log file an error such as the following is printed: 

Unable to delete <UNC share name>\\Config\\WebClient\bootstrap.properties : ServiceException: (error code = -30019; message = "The specified path is invalid."


CAUSE
When running the installer, the value for the configuration directory has been provided as a UNC name. This leads to an error when the installer tries to delete a file in that directory. 


ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2012 Server



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Rather than using a UNC name for the configuration directory during the installation, you should instead supply a local path name for the configuration directory. 

After the installation you can then move the configuration directory to the UNC path, as outlined in the following steps: 

 1. Edit the file web.xml which is being stored in the Workplace XT Installation directory under <Workplace XT Install Dir>\WorkplaceXT\WEB-INF\web.xml. 
 2. Locate the context parameter named configurationDirectory and update the value with the UNC name. The section is as follows:
    <context-param>
    <param-name>configurationDirectory</param-name>
    <param-value><UNC Name>\\Config\\WebClient</param-value>
    </context-param> 
 3. Proceed with re-creating the WAR and EAR files needed for deploying, and with deploying the Workplace XT application on to your application server. These steps are documented in the Workplace XT documentation, which is referenced below.
