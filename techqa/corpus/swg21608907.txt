 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to effectively validate IBM Content Collector web application in a load balancing environment after a fixpack install? 

CAUSE
In a high-availability environment, a load balancer may be used in front of multiple servers running the IBM Content Collector web application service. 

 * In configuration manager, Host name is set to the address of the load balancer in the following:  * General Settings > Configuration Web Service 
    * General Settings > Web Application 
    * General Settings > Metadata Web Application 
   
   

ANSWER
To install a new fixpack, it needs to be applied to all servers running the IBM Content Collector web application service. After installation completes, follow the steps below to validate the web application on each server: 

 * Do not change any settings in IBM Content Collector configuration manager. For example, the web application server host name under General Settings. Continue to use the load balancer address. 
 * Do not change any settings in email clients regarding server host name of the IBM Content Collector configuration web service. Continue to use the load balancer address. 
 * On only one server, start the IBM Content Collector web application service. On all other servers, ensure the IBM Content Collector web application is stopped. This way, when a request is sent to the load balancer address, it will be routed to the server being tested which has the IBM Content Collector web application service running. 
 * Validate IBM Content Collector web application such as:  * Use the Validate button in General Settings > Configuration Web Service in the IBM Content Collector configuration manager. 
    * Perform restore, preview, searches on previously archived emails in email client. 
   
   
 * When one server is validated successfully, stop the IBM Content Collector web application service on that server. On the next server, start the web application service. Repeat the validation steps on each server. Ensure that at any one time, the IBM Content Collector web application service is running on only one server.
