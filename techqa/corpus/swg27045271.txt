 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document outlines the steps required to debug CICS application with RDz and the Integrated Debugger, using DBM and CADP. 

CONTENT
The preferred way to connect Integrated Debugger with the RDz client is using the DBM (Debug Manager).


Prior to attempting a debug session: 

 1. Ensure that the Integrated Debugger host component and DBM are correctly installed and configured on your system [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQ2R2_9.1.1/com.ibm.guide.hostconfig.doc/topics/integrateddebugger.html%23integrateddebugger?lang=en]. 
 2. Review the CICS updates required by the Integrated Debugger. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQ2R2_9.1.1/com.ibm.guide.hostconfig.doc/topics/integrated_debug_CICS.html?lang=en] 
 3. The Integrated Debugger uses CICS CADP to provide TEST runtime options to CICS transactions. Refer to your CICS TS documentation for more information on CADP. However, if desired, you can also use the LE user exit mechanism. The LE user exit mechanism can also be used for regular applications. For details, see Integrated Debugger ELAXF* updates [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/nl/en-us/SSQ2R2_9.1.1/com.ibm.guide.hostconfig.doc/topics/integrateddebugger_ELAXFupdates.html].



To debug a CICS application using the Integrated Debugger with the DBM setting in CADP: 
 1. Ensure that the z/OS connection in your RDz client is connected. 
 2.  <Optional> If your region is not started, start your CICS region as you would normally. 
 3. Logon to the CICS Region where the application will run. 
 4. View the profile list. Clear the screen, enter CADP on the command line and press Enter. The profile list is displayed. 
 5.  <Optional> If you do not yet have a Integrated Debugger profile created. Create one using steps 4-12 from the following task. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQ2R2_9.1.1/com.ibm.debug.pdt.zpcl.doc/topics/cics_debug_t.html] 
 6. Ensure that the debug profile (see previous step) is activated. 
 7. In the Set Compiled Debugging Display Device panel, ensure the session type for your Integrated Debug profile is TCP, and enter DBM as the only value. If you have other TCP/IP values they need to be removed.  *  Note: The DBM (Debug Manager) supports a secondary form: 'DBM.<user>'. Where<user> is the user profile used to run the debug session. 
     * Note: The port value is not used by the DBM (Debug Manager), but it is not permitted for the port value to be 0.[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045271&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045271&aid=1]
    
    
 8. Exit CADP 
 9. Start the transaction. The debug session should start in RDz using the Integrated Debugger.
