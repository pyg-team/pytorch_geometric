PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Runtime problems, such as ClassCastException, can occur if you deploy more than one application packaged with the same Service Component Architecture (SCA) module onto the same cell. 

CAUSE
From WebSphere Integration Developer, the problem can occur when you add a dependent project that includes a sca.module file as a utility Javaâ„¢ archive (JAR) file to multiple applications from the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), perspective. 

From the administrative console, the problem can occur if you rename an application during application installation, such that the module name in the .ear file no longer matches the application name. 

SCA module names within the same cell must be unique. SCA runtime maintains a global registry of SCA modules. During object deserialization, feature definitions are fetched based on module names. If the same module is registered multiple times by different applications, the lookup logic might become inconsistent and cause ClassCastException errors.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not deploy the same SCA module multiple times to the same cell. 


If you must share Web Services Description Language (WSDL) or XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) files between applications, create a "library" in WebSphere Integration Developer to contain the files. Create a unique module for each application, and add the library as a dependency.

If you must deploy the same application multiple times under different application names, also modify the corresponding module name in the sca.module file, so that the module names remain unique within a cell.
