PageIDByBCSep datacap barcode rejected TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Datacap 8.01: when calling PageIDByBCSep action, barcodes are being rejected. 

SYMPTOM
After the PageIDByBCSep action is called, barcodes are being rejected (as recorded in the logs below): 

t:EA0 p:A309868 Horizontal resolution (X): 200
t:EA0 p:A309868 Vertical resolution (Y): 200
t:EA0 p:A309868 Image Width: 1683
t:EA0 p:A309868 Image Height: 2184
t:EA0 p:A309868 
t:EA0 p:A309868 Running barcode recognition for the entire page.
t:EA0 p:A309868 Attempting to read barcode of type(s) 'Unknown'
t:EA0 p:A309868 Orientation 0
t:EA0 p:A309868 Confidence required: 75
t:EA0 p:A309868 Recognition time: 0.015625
t:EA0 p:A309868 Confidence 0 too low - or barcodes were not found.
t:EA0 p:A309868 Enhancing image and retrying...
t:EA0 p:A309868 The oDC2DBCNet Instance was successfully initialized.
t:EA0 p:A309868 1 barcode(s) found.
t:EA0 p:A309868 Barcode 0. Rough Barcode result: 14ISSSL
t:EA0 p:A309868 Confidence: 70
t:EA0 p:A309868 Confidence is lower than the minimum 75. Barcode will be rejected.


CAUSE
The PageIDByBCSep identifies the barcode on the page, and by default, any confidence level on the barcode is less than 75, the barcode will be rejected.l


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To change the default value, in the DCO, right-click "Other", go to Manage Variables, add a 

variable named ReqConf and assign it the value of 0-9. 

This value is used within the <DRIVE>\Datacap\RRS. Also, open the "barcode_p.rrx" to determine the confidence level(see below code): 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
confreq = 75 ' was 81 in previous versions 
sconfreq = Trim(dcoObject.Variable("ReqConf")) 

If sconfreq <> "" Then 
confreq = 10 * CInt(sconfreq) + 1 ' map 0-9 to 1-91 
End If 

WriteLog("Confidence required: " & CStr(confreq)) 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
