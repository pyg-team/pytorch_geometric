APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An HTTPRequest node sends a request and receives a 204 response
   which means that no data is expected. However, the node waits
   for data, until its configured timeout period expires. This
   behaviour occurs only if HTTP 1.1 and keepalive are selected on
   the node properties.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The HTTPRequest timeout only occurs with 'keepalive' sockets, so
   a possible workaround is to use the default HTTP 1.0 setting, or
   use HTTP 1.1 with keepalive off.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker using HTTPRequest with
   keepalive.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   An HTTPRequest node sends a request and receives a 204 response
   which means that no data is expected. However, the node waits
   for data, until its configured timeout period expires. This
   behaviour occurs only if HTTP 1.1 and keepalive are selected on
   the node properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker now processes an HTTP 204 response
   correctly and does not wait for further data on the socket
   before continuing processing.
