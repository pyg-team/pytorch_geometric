Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are users being logged out? 

CAUSE
Adjust session time-out in web.xml

ANSWER
Use web.xml to override the session timeout of the application. So 

if all the users should have a timeout of 120 minutes, 
Sample web.xml.
. 
<session-config> 
<session-timeout>120</session-timeout> 
</session-config> 
. 
You also need to specify the following parameters to tell the application that it 
should use the value to override the default behavior: 
. 
<context-param> 
<param-name>scui-suppress-user-level-sessiontimeout-override</param-na 
me> 
<param-value>y</param-value> 
</context-param>
