QUESTION
 After you installed the T3 and YN agents on the hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS), why does the Application Management Configuration (AMC) Editor fail to open? 

CAUSE
This is a T3-YN coexistence issue. The YN application support files contain a badly signed jar file that conflicts with the jar file that the AMC Editor uses. Specifically, tk_jflt.jar (from ITCAM for WAS) conflicts with kt3com.jar (from ITCAM for Transactions).

ANSWER
 When the T3 and YN agents are installed on the same TEMS or TEPS (Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server), a coexistence issue occurs if the YN application support files are V7.2.0.0 or older. 

When you attempt to open the AMC Editor, the tool does not display messages in the TEP (Tivoli Enterprise Portal). Shortly afterwards, the AMC Editor icon in the TEP toolbar is disabled.

The resolution is to upgrade the YN agent to V7.2 IF03 or later.
