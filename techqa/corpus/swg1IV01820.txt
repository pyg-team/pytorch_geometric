LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TFIM Configuration Guide does not describe the steps to
   enable certificate revocation list checking for certificates
   that are used for XML message signing, verification,
   encryption, and decryption.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is contained in the next release: TFIM
   6.2.2.
   
   There is a
   section that describes the steps to enable certificate
   revocation list checking, but only for certificates that
   are used for SSL connections. The steps to enable
   certificate revocation list checking for certificates that
   are used for XML message signing, verification, encryption,
   and decryption will be added into this section. To this end,
   two paragraphs will be changed, and one section will be
   added.
   
   The paragraph right after the title "Enabling certificate
   revocation checking" will be updated as follows:
   You can use IbmPKIX trust manager to determine the validity
   of server certificates. If you enable this function, the
   trust manager checks the certificate that is presented by
   the SSL server when the SOAP client establishes an SSL
   connection, and checks the certificates that are used for
   XML messages signing, validation, encryption, and
   decryption. If it finds that the certificate has been
   revoked, the operation being attempted will fail.
   
   The title "Enabling the IbmPKIX trust manager", and the
   paragraph right after it will be updated as follow:
   Enabling the IbmPKIX trust manager for SSL connection
   
   To enable Tivoli Federated Identity Manager to use the
   IbmPKIX trust manager to perform certificate revocation
   checking for certificates that are used for SSL connection.
   
   The following subsection will be added:
   Enabling the IbmPKIX trust manager for XML messages signing,
   validation, encryption, and decryption
   
   To enable Tivoli Federated Identity Manager to use the
   IbmPKIX trust manager to perform certificate revocation
   checking for certificates that are used for XML messages
   signing, validation, encryption, and decryption.
   
   1. Login to the Console, and click "Tivoli Federated
   Identity Manager" -> "Domain Management" -> "Runtime Node
   Management". The Runtime Node Management panel is displayed.
   2. Click "Runtime Custom Properties". The Runtime Custom
   Property panel is displayed.
   3. Click "Create". A list item is added to the list of
   properties with the name of "new key" and a value of "new
   value".
   4. Select the newly created placeholder property.
   5. Type "kessjksservice.revocation.enabled" in the "Name"
   field.
   6. Type "true" in the "Value" field.
   7. Click "OK" to apply the changes that you have made and
   exit from the panel.
