ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 24 64 bit Client on a
   Windows 2012
   Virtual Server using VMWare. The SPSS Client installer file was
   downloaded after 23. June 2016 from Passport Advantage. You
   installed Statistics 24 as network installation.
   Sentinel License manager is installed on the same Win2012
   server.
   However, when you run echoid.exe or licenseactivator.exe to
   license Sentinel License manager installtion it can happen you
   get error [88]:
   
   "Sentinel RMS development Kit: Error[88]: Operating in
   stand-alone mode using terminal client. This is not allowed by
   the vendor"
   
   These steps can be done to replicate:
   
   1. Launch Windows 2012 and add Remote Desktop Services (all
   features except the VM one).
   2. Install Sentinel RMS license manager 8.6.1 (Concurrent
   Licensing Tools) as shipped with Statsistics 24. To run
   echoid.exe works.
   3. Then install Statistics 24 (download after 23. June) on the
   same server.  Echoid.exe or licenseactivator.exe works from
   console session but fails from remote desktop session.
   4. Confirm echoid.exe (and licenseactivator) in license manager
   installation directory also does not work from remote session.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. The issue is only
   seen on Windows 64 bit with Statistics 24 64 bit. The issue is
   solved with a new 64 bit installer file posted on passport
   advantage on August 1 2016. Please download from part number
   CNE2AML (Posted August 17 2016, download size 896 MB and install
   this version on the VM Server)
