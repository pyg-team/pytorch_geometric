PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All WebSphere Virtual Enterprise users.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The on demand router (ODR) does not     *
   *                      enforce the routing rules defined at    *
   *                      the ODR dynamic cluster level.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The on demand router (ODR) did not enforce the routing rules
   defined at the ODR dynamic cluster level, because the rules
   configuration file path was incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The on demand router was changed to fix the problem.
   This fix will be included in the next available fix pack
   for WebSphere Virtual Enterprise.
