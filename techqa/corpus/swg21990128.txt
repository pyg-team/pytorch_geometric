 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Support for IBM WebSphere SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 was added to the WebSphere Application Server for z/OS full profile in fix pack 8.5.5.9. However, a bug in the 8.5.5.9 fix pack level can cause the unintended removal of Java 6 on z/OS when you apply service to the Java 8 SDK.


CONTENT
Before you apply service to the Java 8 SDK, you MUST update your WebSphere Application Server for z/OS full profile installation to fix pack 8.5.5.10. 

After your WebSphere Application Server installation is updated, you can then apply service to the Java 8 SDK by installing fix packs or interim fixes. 

You not need to upgrade to fix pack 8.5.5.10 before applying maintenance to the Java 7 SDK or the Java 7.1 SDK.
