PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why attempts to install the IBM Rational Web Platform (RWP) on UNIX or Linux results in the error, INSTCONFFAILED: Cannot create profile: The profile does not exist., and provides instructions to resolve the issue. 

SYMPTOM
 

Attempts to install the Rational Web Platform (RWP) results in errors such as the following:

Creating profile....; This may take a while

INSTCONFFAILED: Cannot create profile: The profile does not exist. For 
more information, consult 
/opt/rational/common/rwp/EmbeddedExpress/
logs/wasprofile/wasprofile_create_profile1.log.

ERROR: Execution of 
/opt/rational/common/rwp/EmbeddedExpress/
bin/wasprofile.sh has failed. Can not create profile



CAUSE
 

The DEBUG environment variable is set in the shell of the user running the installation causing RWP to fail. 


Note: It has been determined over time that having the DEBUG environment variable set during the installation of RWP/WAS EmbeddedExpress for anything besides setting additional debugging JAVA flags causes issues. 

Having the DEBUG environment variables set to off for example, causes problems for RWP while creating the WAS profiles. 

Example:

# ksh
[host1] /home/vobadm 0 # env
_=/usr/bin/env
MANPATH=/usr/atria/doc/man
ocal/man:/usr/man
EnvFile=/home/vobadm/.kshrc
_INIT_UTS_RELEASE=5.8
HZ=100
LC_MONETARY=en_US.ISO8859-1
_INIT_UTS_MACHINE=sun4u
LC_TIME=en_US.ISO8859-1
FPATH=/home/.skel/ksh/kfunc
DEBUG=OFF
PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
_INIT_UTS_VERSION=Generic_117350-36
FEB_SITE=slc
_INIT_RUN_NPREV=0
INFORMIXSQLHOSTS=/opt/informix/sqlhosts
}set sw=3|map {nt -i8w=2w sw=2 tabstop=8 shell=/usr/bin/ksh
report=1|map + {!}fmt


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

UNIX & Linux 

Unset (remove) the DEBUG environment variable before installing ClearCase or ClearQuest with the Web Server (RWP) option. 

 

Example:
@set DEBUG= 



Microsoft Windows


 1. Open the system applet from the Windows control panel. 
 2. Choose the Advanced Tab. 
 3. Click the Environment Variables button at the bottom of the applet. 
 4. Locate and highlight the the DEBUG variable in the User Variables or System Variables section. 
 5. Then choose delete to remove it.
    You can also choose edit and rename the variable to preserve the data associated with it.


Note: A reboot is not required for the changes to take effect. 
If the install is being started from a command window, that window should be closed and a new one should be opened to refresh the list of Environment Variables.
