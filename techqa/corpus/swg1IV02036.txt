PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for CA     *
   * Spectrum 9.0 (CORBA).                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The current published version of the probe reference guide   *
   * does not state that the probe supports 9.x versions of CA    *
   * Spectrum. Running the probe with a 9.x version of CA         *
   * Spectrum also requires the user to copy several .jar         *
   * dependencies from their CA Spectrum installation directory   *
   * to the probe's Java directory.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The updated product documentation will be published with the *
   * next release of the probe.                                   *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The -Summary- and -Setting environment variables- sections of
   the probe reference guide will be updated.
   
   1) The -Summary section will be updated to state that the probe
   supports 9.x versions of CA Spectrum. The additional .jar files
   currently listed as supplied with the probe will be removed.
   
   2) The -Setting environment variables- section will be updated
   as follows:
   
   The probe requires access to the following .jar files that are
   supplied with CA Spectrum and installed to the  <$SPECROOT>/lib
   directory:
   - jsafeJCEFIPS.jar
   - global9<x>.jar
   - sanct6.jar (only required for probe installations on Linux
   operating systems)
   - sanctuary.jar (only required for probe installations on Linux
   operating systems)
   - ssorb9<x>.jar
   - ssorbutil9<x>.jar
   - util9<x>.jar
   - utilapp9<x>.jar
   - utilnet9<x>.jar
   - utilsrv9<x>.jar
   - vbhelper9<x>.jar
   
   where <$SPECROOT> represents the main directory where CA
   Spectrum is installed and 9<x> is the version of CA Spectrum you
   are running.
   
   Before running the probe, you must copy these files to the
   following directory:
   $OMNIHOME/probes/java/nco_p_spectrum_corba_v9/
