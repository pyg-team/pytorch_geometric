ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MLWTO from desc code 3-10, 12 show lines out of alignment.
   Here is the original MLWTO as appears in the syslog:

            THIS IS THE SECOND LINE!
            THIS IS THE THIRD LINE!
   And this is how the messags shows in the netlog:
    USR000I THIS IS THE FIRST LINE!

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of Tivoli NetView for z/OS V5R3.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Lines of a multi-line write to operator *
   *                      (multiline WTO, MLWTO) message from an  *
   *                      unauthorized program are not aligned    *
   *                      properly.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a multi-line write to operator (multiline WTO, MLWTO) is
   issued from an unauthorized program, NetView strips off the plus
   sign ("+") added by MVS from the first line when it receives the
   message. However, MVS also adds an extra blank to each of the
   following lines, but NetView does not remove those also. This
   causes the lines to not be aligned as they were issued.
   The fix for APAR OA19629 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1OA19629] was incorporated into V5R3 incorrectly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module DSIMSGSC is being changed to reset the IFRAUPLS flag if
   the first line of a multiline message does not start with a plus
   sign. Subsequently, the testing of IFRAUPLS for every line
   (including the first one) is enough to indicate whether the
   first character should be stripped off.
