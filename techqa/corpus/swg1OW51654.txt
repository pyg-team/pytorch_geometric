APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I am using the Java Console to access the TBSM system. There I
   am looking for the place to register CICS Transactions.
   With the Classic Console I do it the following way:
   On an LoB containing CICS Transaction objects (e.g. LoB: LOBC ->
   Business System DB Trader -> LoB: DB Trader CICS Components -> L
   Trader CICS Transactions; using the Deutsche Bank database) I vi
   ew "Transaction Status".
   For a transaction shown that way, I select to see the "Propertie
   s"
   There I find a frame called "Additional" with a listbox named
   "Registration Status". There I can choose between the values
   "Registered" and "Unregistered".
   
   Using the Java Console the "Properties" window for a transaction
   not offer the "Registration Status" to change.
