Title: IBM How to activate License Authorization Wizard on Mac OSx when install as network? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have installed IBM SPSS Statistics as network installation on the Client Mac OSx 10.6.8. Now I want to switch the installation to use a site license instead of network license without doing a reinstallation. I don't know where I can launch License Authorization Wizard since there is not one since it is installed using Network Type.

Can this be done?


ANSWER
You need to open up Terminal, then cd to /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/19
cd to /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/20 (for release 20)
cd to /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/21 (for release 21)


then cd to SPSSStatistics.app/Contents/bin folder

you see a file named 'licin.sh' or 'lic.sh'
try putting a dot then forward slash in front of the command: $ ./lic.sh

If you don't have permission you will need to do $SUDO ./lic.sh

You should then see the License Authorization Wizard window to activate your license.
