APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Synchronization issues may happen in systems with high MQ
   connection/disconnections which leads to incorrect quickcell
   usecount. FDCs will be generated indicating the corrupted
   quickcells. Following FDCs with probe ids XC476004,XC034070,
   XC302005, XC014030 may be generated. The FDCs will have the
   function stack
    MQM Function Stack
   ExecCtrlrMain
   zxcProcessMessage
   zxcMQIRequest
   zxcConnectAgent
   xlsAbandonRecoveryToken
   xcsDecrementQuickCellUseCount
   xcsFFST
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue may occur on machines which has high number MQ
   connections and disconnections.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The synchronizing problem occurred because the quickcell
   usecount was not being calculated correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code changes have been made to include additional checks for
   the PID and prevent a partially initialized data structure from
   being used during MQCONN, thus eliminating the synchronization
   issue.
