ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HowTo: Set visual Settings for Views?
   VAR is wondering how he could set the default
   values for views.
   To understand the problem, you could reproduce
   the problem on the
   SmDemo_R18:
   - I defined a bottom-up view for all CATIA parts,
   with the existing
   CATIA parts query (see picture Error_View_1.png)
   - now I run this query and get a new window with
   my results
   Here I've got two questions:
   - Why are there some attributes shown, which are
   not set in my visual
   attributes (for example: ID or creation_date), while
   the shown
   attributes are not displayed? (see picture
   Error_View_2.png)
   - Why are two expand levels shown, although I set
   it up to show only
   one? (see picture Error_View_3.png)
   I could reproduce exactly this issue on my side on
   a R18SP4 smdemo DB
   newly installed.
   Sometimes, after changing the displayed attributes,
   you should close
   the query and launch it again to see the issue.
