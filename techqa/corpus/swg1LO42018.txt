APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Add user dialog should be removed so that we are presented
   with the
   "Select Names" dialog directly instead. I know noone that uses
   the "Add
   user" dialog anymore. It might have been great back when we
   didn't use
   hierarchical names and didn't have the little "man"-icon next to
   the
   input field, but now that we can click the "man"-icon and open
   up the
   "Select Names" dialog it's much easier to find and add names...
   and
   less
   error-prone.
   
   Hope this can be created as a design request or something like
   that.
   Maybe we could have a preference option to by-pass the "Add
   user"
   dialog which would make the UI back-compatible and make the rest
   of us
   add names even faster that what is possible today.
