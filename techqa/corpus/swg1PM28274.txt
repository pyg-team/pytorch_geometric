ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DOORS Web Access 1.4.0 is not refreshing/re-drawing the module
   frame properly when a table containing standard text is
   displayed and while using the frame's scrollbar to scroll down
   or up.  This only occurs in Internet Explorer. There does not
   seem to be a problem when using Firefox.
   
   This has been tested on Internet Explorer 6 and 7 on Windows XP,
   Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
   
   To reproduce the problem:
   
   1. Open a module in DWA (either in review or edit), which
   contains a multiple column, multiple row table containing text
   in various cells and large enough rows to take up more than can
   be displayed at one time.
   2. Once the table is displayed and drawn, scroll down the table
   using the module's scroll bar.
   3. The text from the previous rows and columns will be displayed
   on top of the current rows and columns.
   
   4. They can be (usually) refreshed by hovering the mouse cursor
   over each cell in various places and occasionally when clicking
   on the module frame's title bar.

   Verified using IE7.
   
   As user scrolls horizontally or vertically using the scroll
   bars, the text within the table cells do not appear to
   follow the scrolling and remain stationary while all other
   module items move.
   
   As in the possible workarounds, we found that using the
   mouse to hover over each cell corrects the positioning of
   that cell's content.
