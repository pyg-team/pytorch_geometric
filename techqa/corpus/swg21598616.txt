Title: IBM How to enable Oracle JDBC Driver tracing with WebSphere Application Server - United States

Text:
Connection pooling datasource Oracle JDBC 11g ojdbc6_g.jar ojdbc5_g.jar TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to enable Oracle JDBC driver trace when using a datasource in WebSphere Application Server 

SYMPTOM
When debugging WAS + Oracle connection problems, it sometimes becomes necessary to enable Oracle JDBC driver tracing. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the following as a Generic JVM Argument on the application server (Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name. Then, in the Server Infrastructure section, click Java and process management > Process definition > Java virtual machine) 

-Doracle.jdbc.Trace=true -Djava.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=true -Djava.util.logging.config.file=C:\WAS70\AppServer\profiles\AppSrvXML\logs\server1\OracleTrace\OracleTracing.properties

Replace the existing Oracle driver with the _g version of the driver (for example, ojdbc6_g.jar) in both the file system and in the Classpath field of the Oracle JDBC Provider configuration. The _g driver is a debug version of the driver and can be obtained from Oracle.

The Oracle document 30 Diagnosability in JDBC [http://www.comp.dit.ie/btierney/oracle11gdoc/java.111/b31224/diagnose.htm] provides additional information on generating JDBC trace (see the section entitled Configuring Logging [http://www.comp.dit.ie/btierney/oracle11gdoc/java.111/b31224/diagnose.htm#CIAIDFIC]). The document refers to an OracleLog.properties file instead of OracleTracing.properties.

Please notice: 
If you are using more than one Oracle JDBC Provider in your WebSphere Application Server environment (for example ojdbc7.jar and ojdbc7_g.jar), it is possible that the Oracle JDBC-Driver traces are still missing. In order to avoid this problem, please make sure that all Oracle JDBC Providers use the option "Isolate classloader".
