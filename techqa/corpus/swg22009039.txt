Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Insights Foundation for Energy.

IBM Insights Foundation for Energy is vulnerable to SQL injection (CVE-2017-1311). 
A remote attacker can send specially-crafted SQL statements that can allow the attacker to view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database.

IBM Insights Foundation for Energy is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (CVE-2017-1345). 
This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality and potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.

IBM Insights Foundation for Energy is vulnerable to Detailed Error Messages Revealed (CVE-2017-1342).
This vulnerability can potentially reveal sensitive information in error messages to authenticated users that could be used to conduct further attacks.

This interim fix closes all three vulnerabilites.
