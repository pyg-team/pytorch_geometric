PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an issue that can occur when using IBM Rational ClearCase where running a cleartool rmstgloc command fails to remove an existing registered storage location. 

SYMPTOM
 

Attempt to remove a registered storage location using the rmstgloc command fails to remove the storage location.



CAUSE
 

There are old registered storage locations that exist for servers that are no longer available.

The cleartool rmstgloc [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r1m0/topic/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ref.doc/topics/ct_rmstgloc.htm?resultof=%22rmstgloc%22]command cannot be used to remove these storage locations from the registry because the storage locations have no name and no location. The global path is also invalid. 

Running a cleartool lsstgloc shows the following for a storage location that could not be removed:

Example:
C:\WINDOWS>cleartool lsstgloc -l
Name: Missing Value "old style entry").
Type: VOB
Region: CC_win
Storage Location uuid: Missing Value
Global path: \\aserver\cc_store\vobs\Tutorial
Server host: aserver
Server host path: Missing Value



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

Use the ClearCase Administration Console to remove these registered storage locations. 

You have to log on as a user who is a member of the ClearCase administrators group.
