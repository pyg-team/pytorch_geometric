APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Business Console, create a new test scenario and run it.
   
   if the test scenario file name has some Japanese character, the
   test execution works fine but we cannot download the scenario
   excel file after execution.
   
   Note that this error is seen in two places:
   1) In the report page, on the summary section
   2) In the "Test Suite" page, when clicking on the scenario file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Modify the file name used for the scenario to have an english
   name instead of Japanese.
   <= you will be able to download the report.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  We're unable to download the scenario for Japanese Test
   Scenario because of filename error when downloading the
   input/output report for Japanese Test scenario in Internet
   Explorer. So the fix would be to fix the encoding of the
   filename.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
