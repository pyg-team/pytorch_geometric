QUESTION
 The UX agent consumes a lot of CPU when the "Missing process" situation with multiple wildcards is running:

( MISSING(UNIXPS.UCOMMAND) == ('*scapethomsonp*java*')) 

ANSWER
A new "Process Filter" attribute has been added in ITM 6.22.2 IF03 (6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0003).
A detailed description of this attribute can be found here: 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21451510 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21451510] 

The "Process filter" attribute is a regular expression filter: you need to use ".*" as a wildcard.

The situation - which will decrease the CPU usage - should look like this:
( Process Filter (Unicode) == '.*scapethomsonp.*' AND MISSING(Process Command (Unicode)) == ( '*java*' ))
