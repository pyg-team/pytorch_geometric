APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Env: SCA 1.4.46 and 1.5.78 on Windows
   Users authenticated via Active Directory
   
   Problem:
   Customer has configured SCA with users authenticated via Active
   Directory. He cannot login to SCA Interface with one of his
   users (ABCD), receiving the error:
   
   "There is no user matching the entered user name and password"
   
   even if the user credentials are correct and the user has been
   correctly configured in SCA.
   
   After running some additional troubleshooting with Wireshark
   trace to see the request sent to LDAP, we noticed SCA sends the
   request for the user ABCD with the filter:
   
   (&(&(objectCategory=Person)(|(sAMAccountName=*)(userPrincipalNam
   e=*)))(sAMAccountName=*ABCD*))
   (note the wildcards for sAMAccountName surrounding ABCD).
   .
   The LDAP returns a matching user:
   LDAPMessage bindRequest(1)
   "CN=tABCD,OU=ORGUNIT1,OU=ORGUNIT2,DC=DOMAIN1,DC=DOMAIN2",
   different from ABCD
   .
   Immediately after SCA sends a bindRequests as
   LDAPMessage bindRequest(1)
   "CN=tABCD,OU=ORGUNIT1,OU=ORGUNIT2,DC=DOMAIN1,DC=DOMAIN2" simple
   .
   receiving the bindResponse as:
   LDAPMessage bindResponse(1) invalidCredentials (80090308:
   LdapErr:
   DSID-0C0903A9, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 775,
   v1db1)
   
   Customer has removed the user tABCD and the login of the user
   ABCD worked correctly.
   So the login does not seem to work properly when Active
   Directory contains two users with matching pattern (or better
   the name of the problematic user is a substring of the second
   user name)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid the definition of SCA user with the name which is a
   substring of the name of another SCA user (f.i. avoid to define
   ABCD if another SCA user tABCD is already defined).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   SCA user encounters error when logging and authenticating via
   Active Directory.
   Problem Summary:
   The user encounters the following error message 'There is no
   user matching the entered user name and password' when trying to
   log in. This is due to a problem SCA has with handling 2 users
   with the same name in the LDAP or Active Directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue is resolved in SCA 1.6.
