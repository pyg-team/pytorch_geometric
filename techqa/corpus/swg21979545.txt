Title: IBM DataStage error connecting to Oracle 12c server from 11c client. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Information Server DataStage 11.5 job containing Oracle Connector stage running on Windows attempts to connect to 64-bit Oracle server on same machine using 32-bit Oracle client, but gets error: 

"Error loading connector library ccora12c.dll. %1 is not a valid Win32 application." 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error has multiple possible causes:


 1. Confirm that the Oracle client library is the 32-bit client library. Information Server 11.5 on Windows (even 64-bit windows) is still a 32-bit application. The 32-bit client library must be in system PATH ahead of any 64-bit Oracle libraries.
    
 2. Open the Oracle Connector stage properties in DataStage Designer client and in list of properties find the one labeled "Oracle Client Version". Confirm it is set to 12c if that is the version of the Oracle client software installed on the DataStage engine tier server machine. 
 3. If your Oracle Server is 12c and your Oracle Connector Stage property defines Oracle Client Version as 12c, yet you actually have the Oracle 11g client installed, then you have 2 options: 
    
    a) Keep the 32-bit Oracle 11gR2 or 11gR2 client, and update the Oracle Connector Stage properties to set the client version field mentioned above to 11g rather than 12c, then save and re-compile job. 
    
    b) Install 32-bit Oracle 12c client, and update Windows PATH to have the 12c client in place of 11gR2 client, then stop and restart the DataStage engine (a reboot may also be needed).
