QUESTION
 The normal process to add a field upgrade feature does not work for Extended Oracle support for Database Connectivity on appliances that did not ship with firmware version 6.0.1 or later pre-installed. How do you add support for this feature on these appliances? 

CAUSE
Appliances that do not ship with firmware version 6.0.1 or later do not have the correct feature license.

ANSWER
Extended Oracle support for Database Connectivity includes support for Oracle RAC Fast Application Notification. Support is available for DataPower appliances that meet the following criteria: 

 * The following machine types: 7199 (2426-42X, 2426-43X, 2426-62X, 2426-63X ), 7198 (2426-32X, 2426-33X), or 4195 (2426-4BX) 
 * The following appliances: WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XG45, WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI52, or WebSphere DataPower Integration Blade XI50B 
 * Firmware version 6.0.1.0 or later 
 * Appliances with the Database Connectivity feature (DCO)


Normally, you can upgrade a license feature without needing to contact IBM Support.  * For appliances purchased through Passport Advantage, you would obtain the upgrade through Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/] 
 * For pre-Passport Advantage appliances, you would use the following technote: Upgrading a DataPower appliance to add a field upgrade feature [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507058].


However, if your appliance was not shipped with firmware version 6.0.1.0 or later pre-installed, you must contact IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] to enable Extended Oracle support for Database Connectivity. 

If your appliance was shipped with 6.0.1.0 or later pre-installed, you can use the normal process for your appliance machine type to add the Extended Oracle support for Database Connectivity. RELATED INFORMATION
