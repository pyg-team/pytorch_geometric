APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a service fails, it remains in the Process Admin Console
   Process Monitor view as "Active Currently Executing".
   The service remains as "Active Currently Executing" even if you
   rerun the task, it completes successfully, and the instance and
   task are marked as closed or complete.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The service engine didn't mark a task as finished for Process
   Monitor when this task failed. As a result, the Process Admin
   Console showed this service as still executing in the Process
   Monitor view. This error doesn't affect the execution of the
   service or process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.03
   that modifies the service engine to trigger the task exit so
   that the service is no longer shown as executing.
