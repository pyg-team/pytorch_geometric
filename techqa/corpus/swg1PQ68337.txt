APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you try to profile a simple application:
   java
   Then you press &#162;C to exit (after the dialog box appears
   from the application). You will get:
   
   &#162;CDumping contended monitor usage ...   stackpointer=34636608
   Writing Java core file ....
   At this point java is hung. kill -9 does not help.
   This fails for other applications as well.
   Example WebSM on AIX 5.1 gives:
   wsm -Xrunhprof:monitor=y,thread=y,cpu=times
   
   results in:
    HPROF ERROR: method on stack top != method exiting..
    HPROF ERROR : stack underflow in method exit
   	 .
   	 .
   	 .
    stackpointer=3a990d68
    and then java hangs.
    If I remove the cpu=times option, it looks to work fine.
   
    But killing wsm by Del generates:
   
    Dumping contended monitor usage ...   stackpointer=38854a58
    Writing Java core file ....
   
    hang!
