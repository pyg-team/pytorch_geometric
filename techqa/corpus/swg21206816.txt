QUESTION
 How can I add a member to a subscription set when the names of the source and target columns do not match? 

ANSWER
You can use any of the following methods: 

 * If you are using the Replication Center:
   1. In the Add Member notebook, on the Member Information page change the default name of the target table to the name of your existing target table. 
   2. Click the Change button to open the Member Properties notebook. 
   3. On the Column Mapping page, map the source column from the left side panel to the required target column on the right side panel.

 * If you are using ASNCLP:
   If the target table exists, the default column mapping rule is "Map by name." That is, all the names of the registered columns in the source and the names of the target columns must match. 
   
   To get around this restriction, you can issue the CREATE MEMBER command with the COLS INCLUDE option.
   
   CREATE MEMBER IN SETNAME <set_name> APPLYQUAL <apply_qual> SOURCE <source_owner.sourcename> TARGET <target_owner.target_name> COLS INCLUDE (SOURCECOL1 TARGETCOL1, SOURCECOL2 TARGETCOL2, .. .. , .. .. , SOURCECOLn TARGETCOLn)
   
   In the command, you must provide the names of all the source and target columns participating in the member.

 * If your target table is a nickname that points to an existing table on a non-DB2 target, you could alter the column name in the target nickname to match with the source column name.
   
   ALTER NICKNAME <target_nickname> ALTER COLUMN TARGETCOL1 LOCAL NAME SOURCECOL1;
   
   With this method, you change only the column name in the nickname and not the column name in the non-DB2 target table.
