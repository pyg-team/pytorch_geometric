ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DM buttons sometimes do not appear in Word (related to PMR
   06870
   999 806).
   After opening word with a document containing macros and then
   closing
   the document the DM buttons disappear. When opening a new
   document
   after this there is no question to start DM and no DM buttons
   appear.
   This has been demonstrated to Patrick Dias in a sametime meeting
   2006-
   11-10.
   Steps to reproduce issue, all are done with DM already open and
   a user
   logged inn, all other programs (including Word) are closed. Most
   of the
   issues are recreated with the document testDato.doc. The issues
   are
   however not solely related to this document.
   1a) Start->Run, <path>\testDato.doc
   1b) Answer disable macros, and Yes to start DM - Buttons now
   show up
   1c) File-Close, press leave local, and no to save the template
   1d) Start->Run, <path>\testDato.doc
   1e) disable macros this time as well
   1f) Now there is no question to start DM, and no buttons appear
   
   Part II
   Word asks if users want to save the template when closing a
   document that is based on a template.
   It seems from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291352 that this
   is
   because of the addin misbehaving.
   Steps to reproduce the issue. Done with DM already open and a
   user
   logged inn, all other programs (including Word) are closed. Done
   using
   the attached document testDato.doc and template TINE Brevmal
   bokmaal.
   dot. The issues are however not solely related to these
   documents.
   3a) Start->Run, <path>\testDato.doc
   3b) Answer disable macros, and Yes to start DM
   3c) File-Close, press leave local
   3d) The user is now asked to save the template. This does not
   happend
   if you answer No to integrate with DM
   
   
   Part III
   The question "Would you like Word to use DM?" is not consistent.
   This is asked if execute a document or template, but not if you
   start
   winword.exe directly. (this is related to PMR 15056 999 806)
   There is also issues with this question often not appearing when
   the
   document is opened, but first appearing when the document is
   closed.
   This causes the DM buttons to not be available when needed.
   4a) Start->Run, Winword.exe
   4b) The question is not asked, but buttons still show up in Word
   4c) Close Word
   4d) Start->Run, <path>\testDato.doc
   4e) Now the question comes up
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Several problems existed with DB2 Document Manager and
   Microsoft Word integration:
   
    - If a user started the DB2 Document Manager Desktop and logged
      into a library before the user started Microsoft Word,
      integration between the two applications was not
      automatically enabled, as it should have been. When this
      happened, DB2 Document Manager commands were not visible in
      Microsoft Word.
   
    - When a user closed a document that was created from a
      template, the user was prompted to save the document changes
      to the template. Also, after the document and the associated
      template were closed, the DB2 Document Manager toolbars that
      were  associated with the template were removed.
   
    - When a user double-clicked a Microsoft Word document or a
      template, the user was not prompted to use DB2 Document
      Manager with Microsoft Word and integration between the two
      applications was not automatically enabled, as it should
      have been. When this happened, DB2 Document Manager commands
      were not visible in Microsoft Word.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in DB2 Document Manager v8.3 Fix Pack 7
   and v8.4.
