Title: IBM CDM - Current User Token Expiration - United States

Text:
continue; restart token expiration TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to continue working in IBM Cognos Disclosure Management application, once the current user token expired after a period of inactivity? What are the purposes of Continue/Restart buttons? 

CAUSE
This information should assist the users with handling the token expiration behavior in CDM.

ANSWER
CDM client handles a user security token which shows a Continue/Restart prompt when the session expires. Once a session expired (by default it expires after 2 hours of inactivity), the CDM session needs to be restarted in order to be able to continue working in the application. 


The "Continue" option allows the user to keep viewing the content of the current state of the client, but any subsequent actions will result with displaying the prompt again or other exceptions, and the session needs to be reactivated.

For additional information about the token expiration in CDM and how to increase the expiration time, check the Technote below:

*Note that it is not a best practice to to disable this feature, as it will lower the security of the system. If mandated by business concerns, you may increase the expiration time, but it should not be disabled.
