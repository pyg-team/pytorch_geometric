Title: IBM Incorrect URLs are generated for the Human Task Manager after creating the deployment environment using the configureNode command for Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced - United States

Text:
BPM; configureNode; Human Task Manager; bpc; Administrator URL; Process Explorer URL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you create a deployment environment using the configureNode command, you get incorrect URLs for the "Administrator URL prefix" and "Process Explorer URL prefix" on the Human Task Manager configuration page. 

SYMPTOM
When you use the configureNode command to create a deployment environment, the deployment profile, the custom profile and the clusters are created automatically. These profiles and clusters are created according to definitions in the deployment manager profile and custom profile response files. 

To see the values, to the Human Task Manager configuration page in the Administrative Console. The configuration page is accessible by clicking Servers > Clusters > WebSphere application server clusters > BPM.AppTarget > Human Task Manager. On that page, you see the following incorrect URLs: 

 * Administrator URL prefix
   https://host_name:port_numberbpc
   
   
 * Process Explorer URL prefix
   https://host_name:port_numberbpc


CAUSE
This issue is a known issue in IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.1 Fix Pack 1.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete one of the following actions: 

 * Upgrade IBM Business Process Manager to V8.0.1 Fix Pack 2. 
   
   
 * Modify the URLs as listed in the following examples, synchronize changes, and restart the App Target cluster.  * Administrator URL prefix
      https://host_name:port_number/bpc 
    * Process Explorer URL prefix
      https://host_name:port_number/bpc
      
      
      Note: The difference between the incorrect and the correct URLs is that the correct URLs contain a forward slash between the port_number variable value and bpc
