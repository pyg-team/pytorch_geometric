Text:
WTX TX Launcher work files error 17 unique .FNL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) maps executed using the Launcher failing due to work files not found. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is in the launcher log.

ERROR : I/O Creat RunMap=MapName.mmc Failed to open MapName.FNL Error=17 (mercio.c:3169)


CAUSE
If work files are not unique and you have multiple different launchers (separate launcher processes) using the same run map, this problem can happen.

ENVIRONMENT
Using the IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Launcher to run multiple ITX Maps using RUN Maps.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Error 17 means that the file already exists. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change that RUN map to use unique work files.
