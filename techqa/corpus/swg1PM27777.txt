APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Windows
   
   Product name: IBM? Rational? Business Developer
   
   Program Version    :  7.5.1.6
   Description.
   Declaring a constant array of constants produces a build,
   generation error.
   The following declaration reproduces this condition:
   // basic library
   
   library simplelib type BasicLibrary {}
   
   // set MCLB_MESSAGE
   
   const mclbMessageFreeFormat smallint = 100;
   const mclbMessage smallint[1] = [mclbMessageFreeFormat];
   
   end
   
   
   The message displayed relating to the build error is found in
   the workspace .log file referring to 'Exception stack trace:
   com.ibm.etools.edt.internal.core.builder.BuildException:
   java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for
   bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key 0'.
   
   Workaround
   When the CONST attribute of the array is dropped the code
   generation completes successfully.

   ****************************************************************
   Coding a reference to a constant inside of an array constant
   value resulted in an exception being thrown during
   compilation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to issue a validation error
   message when this is attempted. Currently, only literals are
   valid for use as constant values and inside array constants
   values.
