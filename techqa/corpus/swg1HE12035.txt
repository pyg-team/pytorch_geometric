APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When IBM Content Collector Outlook Web App (OWA) Support is
   configured and Outlook Web App is used with Microsoft Internet
   Explorer 10, the following problems occur:
   - Navigation between mails in the OWA client is not possible.
   - Clicking mails or links in the mailbox area of the screen
   causes the application to hang.
   - The restore button at the top of the mailbox view is not
   displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9 to access OWA.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When IBM Content Collector Outlook Web App Support is
   configured, the IBM Content Collector OWA Extension adds some
   DOM nodes in the Microsoft Outlook Web App UI. These nodes add
   Content Collector functions like, for example, "Mark for
   Archiving", "Restore", and "Specify additional archiving
   Information". In Internet Explorer 10, the method of adding DOM
   nodes that works in Internet Explorer 8 is not supported. As a
   result, the buttons that are added by IBM Content Collector do
   not show up. In addition, the navigation in the Microsoft
   Outlook Web App UI is blocked intermittently.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0 LA001 and IBM Content
   Collector 4.0 Fix Pack 2, IBM Content Collector Outlook Web App
   Support can be used with Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 without
   problems.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fix 4.0.0.0-IBM-ICC-OWA-LA001 is available.
