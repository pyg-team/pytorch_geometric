ANSWER
1. What steps should I follow to change Portal-related passwords?
The WebSphere Portal documentation contains instructions for both Version 6.1 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v615/security/sec_pswds.html] and [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Updating_user_ID_and_passwords_wp7]Version 7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Updating_user_ID_and_passwords_wp7].

2. How can I configure LDAP failover in WebSphere Portal?

See Implementing LDAP failover [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21382720].

3. Login fails for a single user or a small number of users and only on specific workstations. What might cause this?

Client add-ons could prevent successful login [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21441915]

4. After login a single image file is shown in the browser and nothing else, how can I resolve this?

Apply APAR PM25450 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM25450] then perform the manual configuration steps listed in the APAR text.

5. Should I configure the Portal for standalone or federated LDAP security?

Federated security is the out-of-the-box configuration. The configuration task wp-modify-ldap-security "converts" the configuration to standalone with a single LDAP. Use standalone if you: (1) Will not require more than one LDAP or another type user repository (for example, a database), (2) Will not need to configure multiple virtual portals, each with its own realm.

6. Is my current security configuration is standalone or federated?

Determining whether WebSphere Portal security configuration is standalone or federated [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21386736]

7. Configuration changes in our environment have caused access to Portal artifacts to be lost. How can I restore access?

See How to fix Portal Access Control settings after user/group external identifiers have changed [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21377025]

8. In our environment, updates are made to LDAP directly outside Portal. The changes are not immediately visible in the Portal or in our custom portlet. Why is this?

Both the Portal User Management Architecture (PUMA) and WebSphere Application Server Virtual Member Manager (VMM) component maintain caches that are automatically updated only if user, group or attribute changes are made using the Portal UI.

You can adjust the cache time [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21413947] out periods, disable the caches [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21379992] (this is to be avoided due to its effect on performance), or, if you have custom code that calls or can be modified to call the PUMA reload() method, apply APAR PM16430 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM16430] and add the associated new properties.

9. Is there a document that summarizes the ReleaseBuilder tool?

Yes. See Using ReleaseBuilder effectively [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21243005]

10. How do I collect log files or trace for a WebSphere Portal security issue?

Follow the appropriate Collecting Data [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21312740] document for the version of Portal in use.
