Text:
authentication roles permission privilege TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 LDAP users who are successfully integrated with WebGUI cannot perform actions on events such as acknowledge, delete, etc. 

SYMPTOM
In ncw.log, the following message is present:


[server.startup : 1] com.ibm.tivoli.ncw.security.vmm.NCOSSyncManager.init:
HEMES0064I=The ObjectServer is installed as a user repository. Automatic user synchronization from other repositories will not be performed.


CAUSE
ObjectServer repository is still configured even after it was removed from the federated repositories list in WebSphere Administrative Console.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ObjectServer repository entry must be removed manually from wimconfig.xml. The file is located as follows:

<TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/wim/config/wimconfig.xml

Next, remove the XML fragment com.ibm.tivoli.tip.vmm4ncos.ObjectServerAdapter from the XML file and restart TIP.
