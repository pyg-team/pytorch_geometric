QUESTION
 What levels of the IBM Developer for z Systems and Rational Developer for z Systems host and client are compatible? 

ANSWER
Client/Server Compatibility



In general, IBM Developer for z Systems, Rational Developer for z Systems and Rational Developer for System z follow a two level backward and forward compatibility tolerance for basic Client /Server functionality. 

IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host and Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host. 

IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x, and v9.0.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1, v9.0.x, and v8.5.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v9.0.x host/client is compatible with versions v9.5.x, v9.1.x, v9.0.x, v8.5.x and v8.0.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v8.5.x host/client is compatible with versions v9.1, v9.0, v8.5, v8.0.x, and v7.6.x client/host. 

Basic Client/Server functionality includes: 
• Connecting to a z/OS System 
• Allocating z/OS Data sets 
• Creating a z/OS Project 
• Working with z/OS COBOL & Pl/I remote assets – edit, syntax check, submit, execute, debug and view the output 
• Basic CARMA functionality 
• Compatibility between service levels within a release is also supported (for example, using the v9.5 client to access a v9.5.1 server). 

As an example, if you upgrade your Developer for z Systems host to 14.0.x, client versions v9.1.x, v9.5.x, v14.0 and v14.1.x are compatible with the 14.0.x server. 

Likewise, if you upgrade your Developer for z Systems client to 14.0.x, server versions v9.1.x, v9.5.x, v14.0.x and v14.1.x are compatible with the 14.0.x client. 

Note: Server enhancements that are client-dependent are not available to developers using earlier versions of the client. 

Client enhancements that are server-dependent are not available to developers accessing earlier versions of the server.
