ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational(R) Software Architect 6.0.0.1 when you when you do a
   Visualize existing -> Java Type in a UML2 diagram succeeds if
   there is an open Java project in the browser.  The UML2 diagram
   can then be populated with Java visualizations of class files.
   However the problem is in the future if that same diagram is
   opened without the originally referenced Java project then the
   links will be broken.  The Java project does not cascade open or
   close with the UML2 diagram.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Open a Java Project and a UML Project in RSA.  In a class
   diagram under the UML project, right click and select Visualize
   Existing.  Choose a Java type from the Java Project.
   
   Problems:
   1. User can inadvertently add external project references to
   their project using the Visualize Existing.
   2. There is no mechanism to select or change what class is
   referenced.
   3. There is no mechanism in RSA to determine the source that a
   particular class is referencing.
   4. Once the UML2 Model has Java elements in it, the UML2 Model
   takes on Java project characteristics.  Namely the context menu
   will now have entries for adding new Java classes, but those
   options will always fail as the folder is not a Java project.
   5. When the external referenced Java visualizations are
   introduced it does not create a situation when the referenced
   source would be cascade open or closed with the UML2 model.
   
   This problem will also extend to multiple Java projects.  If
   multiple Java projects are open and a user uses the Visualize
   existing, then there is no way to determine what source is used
   for the visualization, opening the user up to inadvertent
   external references.  Also this problem could potentially affect
   RSM users who are attempting to look at UML diagrams that
   include these Java visualizations.
