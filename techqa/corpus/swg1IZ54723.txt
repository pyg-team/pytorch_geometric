ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   ITM 6.2.1 IF3 clustered TEPS on UNIX/Linux
   Problem Description:
   Each configuration of the TEPS causes the JNLP files in the
   <platform>/cw directory to be updated with the short physical
   hostname, causing the clients to be unable to connect to the
   TEPS. The logical cluster hostname is required and preferrably
   the fully qualified hostname as TEPS clients are also present in
   different DNS- domains.
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   Set up TEPS in a cluster on AIX as described here:
   .

   NavCode=1TW10TM4G [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/portal/opal/details?NavCode=1TW10TM4G]
   Reconfigure TEPS
   Notice that the physical hostname is used in the jnlp files
   causing TEP not to connect. This should be the logical cluster
   name defined in lnxenv.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  High availability portal server cluster is made of multiple
   underlying physical nodes that are seen outside as a one virtual
   machine. For the client applications such as TEP started via
   Java Web Start only virtual machine name is known, all physical
   nodes are not accessible, since their DNS names are not
   registered by any outside DNS servers. So far, URLs inside TEP
   JNLP descriptors have included address of active physical node
   instead of the virtual cluster name. In this way some resources
   were not accessible, and loading TEP via Java Web Start has been
   failing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now all URLs in JNLP are updated during portal server
   configuration to include virtual host name, to allow Java Web
   Start successfully download all needed resources. The virtual
   cluster name must be specified during portal server
   installation.
