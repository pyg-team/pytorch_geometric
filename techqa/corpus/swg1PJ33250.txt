   warnings occur if document title in the base doc class is
   marked required
   Steps to reproduce the problem:
   In Enterprise Manager, select the Form Policy class property
   Select Property Definitions in the property tab
   Click Inherited Properties
   Select Document Title then click Edit
   Select the More Tab
   Check the Value required check box and save until you return to

   Log in to Workplace
   Add a Form Template (ITX) file to the object store

   document Entry Template
