PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are experiencing a problem during installation or uninstallation with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) and would like to know what documentation you must collect. 

This MustGather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris systems.
Return to the WMB / IIB MustGather index [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Check for known issues: Resolving problems when installing (IIB 9.0) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu16190_.htm]
    Resolving problems when installing (IIB 10.0) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu16190_.htm]Resolving problems when uninstalling (IIB 9.0) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au18431_.htm]Resolving problems when uninstalling (IIB 10.0) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au18431_.htm]

STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. mqsidc
    See: mqsidc usage instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu46012_.htm]
     * If a broker or execution group is not used, gather generic data using the General Collector
    
    
 2. 
 3. General Broker information  * Record the operating system version, release, and maintenance level.
     * Collect the local error log. 
     * Collect the Standard Output/Error logs.
       WMB writes information to both stdout and stderr. These files are located under the Message Broker workpath.
       See: Standard System Logs [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14165_.htm]
    
    
 4. 
 5. Installation Logs  * WMB 8.0, IIB 9.0, and IIB 10.0
       In more recent versions, there are two installation logs:
       /$MQSI_FILEPATH$/IBM_WebSphere_Message_Broker_InstallLog.log
       /$MQSI_WORKPATH$/WMB_<VRMF>_installer_debug.log
     *

ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 



STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
