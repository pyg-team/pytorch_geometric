APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Trying to use Oracle DSA on AIX 5.3.
   Impact 5.1 installed.
   Multiple problems found, however, I worked with these yesterday
   without
   issues.  Nothing should have changed however.
   When I started to discover the problem, I started from scratch,
   deleting all data sources and types and restarting eWAS.
   Problem still
   persists.
   I can create a data source to Oracle just fine, test
   connectivity works.
   WHen creating a data type based on that, initially I can perform
   all
   actions: select database & table, refresh works and I can select
   key
   field. However, once the refresh returns the results of all
   fields, the
   table select no longer works, all that is listed is ________.  I
   can
   save at this point however.  Any subsequent edits of the data
   type do
   not work, I get the same problem.  If I add another data type
   for the
   source, the same behavior will be seen.
   Assuming the issue was GUI based only, I tried using the type in
   a
   policy (one that previously worked with the data type and
   similar
   ones).  When attempting to access the data type using
   AddDataItem I get
   the error in the netcool.log file saying "Unable to generate
   column
   name/value map, this may be caused by changes in the database
   schema
   ..."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None/ L3 provide a Work Around:
   
   1) After you save the data type in the GUI
   2) stop the server impact server
   3) go to $NCHOME/impact/etc
   4) edit the data type file and remove the double quotes around
   the table
   name
   5) Start the sever
   6) check the GUI and you will see the tables.
   
   NOTE: if you refresh again, the table name will change to
   ______. and if
   you try to refresh with the table name "_____", you will get the
   error
   we saw.
