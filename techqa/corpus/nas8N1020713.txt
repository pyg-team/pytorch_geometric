 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C Library is used by Power Hardware Management Console (HMC). HMC has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
DESCRIPTION:The send_dg function in resolv/res_send.c in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.20 does not properly reuse file descriptors, which allows remote attackers to send DNS queries to unintended locations via a large number of request that trigger a call to the getaddrinfo function.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID:CVE-2014-7817 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7817]
DESCRIPTION:The wordexp function in GNU C Library (aka glibc) 2.21 does not enforce the WRDE_NOCMD flag, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by input containing "$((`...`))".
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/98852 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/98852] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

CVEID:CVE-2014-9402 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9402]
DESCRIPTION:The nss_dns implementation of getnetbyname in GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.21, when the DNS backend in the Name Service Switch configuration is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by sending a positive answer while a network name is being process.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99289 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99289] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID:CVE-2015-1472 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1472]
DESCRIPTION:The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact using a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635] for the current score.
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
