QUESTION
 How can I find in the cogserver.log when someone accesses Cognos Administration 

ANSWER
Search for one of the two following within the cogserver.log file: 

 - PAGELET 
- /Portal/Administration/Pagelets/Console/Status/Current Activities


After running a verification test on my 8.4 server with the logging level set on 'Basic', the following 9 entries are entered into the cogserver.log file when I navigate from Cognos Connection Home (Public Folders) to 'IBM Cognos Administration' from the Launch Menu. To note - I did remove the extra (IP, port, CAM information as it was not relivant to this answer).

Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY DISPATCHER /Configuration/http://localhost:9300/p2pd Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY ACCOUNT /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User Success 
Audit.RTUsage.cms.CM QUERY PAGELET /Portal/Administration/Pagelets/Console/Status/Current Activities Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY DISPATCHER /Configuration/http://localhost:9300/p2pd Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY FOLDER /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User/My Folders Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY ACCOUNT /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY ACCOUNT /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY ACCOUNT /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User Success 
Audit.Other.cms.CM QUERY FOLDER /Directory/SunOne/Staff/Admin User/My Folders SuccessSuccess 

From these entries, you can see that the following entry is the primary that you will want to search for:
PAGELET /Portal/Administration/Pagelets/Console/Status/Current Activities

This entry is showing that I am accessing a 'PAGELET' for the 'Current Activities' section on the Administration page.
You could also search on the phrase 'PAGELET' to see all of these occurrences.
