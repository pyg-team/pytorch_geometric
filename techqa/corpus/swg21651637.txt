 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack fails to install onto WAS Version 8.5.0.2 with an error indicating "Installation Manager cannot find any updates to install...". 

SYMPTOM
You installed WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.0.0 onto a Windows machine (or any distributed operating system platform). You used the Installation Manager GUI to install the WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.0.2 fixpack. You are now trying to install the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack using a local repository. The IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack was down loaded from the same web page that contained the WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.0.2 fixpack down load. 

The part names for the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack you down loaded were:

7.0.4.0-WS-IBMWASJAVA-part1.zip
7.0.4.0-WS-IBMWASJAVA-part2.zip

You down load and unzip the two .zip files into the same folder on your local machine per the installation instructions for a local repository. You added the fixpack local repository file (repository.xml) to the Installation Manager (File -> Preferences -> Repositories -> Add Repositories) correctly.

You then use the Installation Manager GUI to install the optional SDK Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack package but receive an error indicating "Installation Manager cannot find any updates to install...".

CAUSE
This error occurs because you are trying to install the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack when the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 product is not already installed.
IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 6.0 is installed by default with WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5. Optionally, you can install IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 as well using the Installation Manager GUI.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the error and install the optional IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.4.0 fixpack, the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 product must first be installed before the fixpack can be installed. You can use the same Installation Manager GUI to install the product:
