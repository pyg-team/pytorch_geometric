Gather Documentation APM 7.7 The APM UI log becomes quite large rather quickly. Once the data is gathered, turn off the debugging. 
 1. Set tracing with the APM UI with Actions -> Trace level, start with the Moderate setting. Alternatively, the trace level can be updated through the /opt/IBM/APMUI/config
    
 2. Recreate the problem
    
 3. Send screen shots of the problem including screen shots of the APM UI and all errors. 
    - verify that the data provider is set in the APM UI
    - screen print of the problem encountered
    
 4. Use the pdcollector [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSATHD_7.7.0/com.ibm.apm.doc_77/apm_ui_docs/apmui_77/pd_collector.html] tool to create the apm_pdcollector jar file. 
    This tool is located in the /opt/IBM/APMUI/tools/ directory on LINUX
    C:\Program Files\IBM\APMUI\tools directory on Windows
    
 5. Run the prereq scanner found on 
    Windows: C:\Program Files\IBM\APMUI\usr\servers\apmui\apps\customcfg\dataProviderVer.bat
    Linux: /opt/IBM/APMUI/usr/servers/apmui/apps/customcfg/dataProviderVer.sh
    
    For example "C:\Program Files\IBM\APMUI\usr\servers\apmui\apps\customcfg\dataProviderVer.bat"
    -s myTEPSserver -u TEPSuser -p TEPSpass -o dataproviderport > dataprodveroutput.txt
    
 6. Send the pdcollector output, the dataProviderVer output and screen shots to the Support PMR.
    

APM 7.6  * Trace settings APM UI 7.6  * Update the APM UI configuration file on the server
    *  Modify APMUI log level
      Edit <TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/apmTIP.war/apmui.cfg 
      ModifyAPMUI_TRACE_LEVEL=ERRORtoAPMUI_TRACE_LEVEL=DEBUG_MAX
      Apply config changes 
      Open command line and navigate to
      TIP_HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\installedApps\TIPCell\isc.ear\apmTIP.war\customCfg\ 
      
      Run this command:  * Windows 
         apmuicfg.bat -u <TIP user> -p <TIP password> -o <TIP Port> 
         
         UNIX/Linux 
         apmuicfg.sh -u <TIP user> -p <TIP password> -o <TIP Port> 
      
      
   
   

 * Gather Documentation APM UI 7.6

The APM UI log becomes quite large rather quickly. Once the data is gathered, turn off the debugging in the configuration file. 
 1. There is no need to stop or restart the TIP
    
 2. Set tracing as noted above
    
 3. Recreate problem and take screen print of issue
    
 4. Use the pdcollector [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSATHD_7.7.0/com.ibm.apm.doc_77/apm_ui_docs/apmui_77/pd_collector.html] tool to create the apm_pdcollector jar file. This tool is located in the <TIP Home>/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/apmTIP.war/ directory.
    
 5. Send screen shots of the problem including screen shots of the APM UI and all errors. Include these screen shots 
    - from TIP, verify connection to TEPS is working
    - verify that the data provider is set in the APM UI
    
 6. Include all files found in this TEPS directory if there are data provider issues
    On Linux, /opt/IBM/ITM/li6263/iw/
    On Windows, \IBM\ITM\CNPS\
