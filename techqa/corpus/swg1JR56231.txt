APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you update an application with an MQ JMS binding or MQ
   binding, the MQ created callback queue is deleted while the
   application is uninstalled or updated. As a result, the callback
    messages are lost for the processes that are still running
   during the update and those processes might fail because the
   callback queue cannot be found when the response message is
   reached.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new JVM property, SCA.recycleDestinations, will be included in
    an upcoming IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix to enable you to
   control the behavior of the callback queue during application
   update. To keep the callback queue and messages while the
   applications are being uninstalled or updated, set the
   SCA.recycleDestinations property to false.
   
   Important: On a cluster environment, you must also set this
   property for the deployment manager JVM.
