Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Samba affect IBM i - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Samba is supported on IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-15275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15275]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a heap memory information leak. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain password hashes or other high-value data.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135221 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135221] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-15087 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15087]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak over SMB1. By sending specially crafted SMB1 data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause portions of server memory contents to be written to a file and obtain sensitive information. Note: This is a complete fix for CVE-2017-12163.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134666 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134666] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-15086 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15086]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to properly sign and encrypt DFS redirects when the max protocol for the original connection is set as ''SMB3''. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to read and alter confidential documents. Note: This is a complete fix for CVE-2017-12151.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134665 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134665] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-15085 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15085]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to require SMB signing in SMB1/2/3 connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to hijack client connections and obtain sensitive information. Note: This is a complete fix for CVE-2017-12150.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134664 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134664] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-14746 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14746]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free memory error. By sending a specially crafted SMB1 request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135222 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/135222] for the current score
