   Steps to replicate (if applicable)
   ---------------------------------- Create a simple Operator
   View with no Event Panel, no Action Panel and a single
   Information Group to display some data in Tabbed style.  For
   example: a  By Filter  Information Group against a DataType
   into the alerts.status table of an ObjectServer, which is being
   populated by a default Simnet Probe, with the Filter statement:
   
   Class = 3300
   
   Once configured & saved simply open a Browser against the
   Operator View eg:
   
   http://<Hostname>:<Port>/opview/displays/<Cluster>-<OperatorVie
   w>.html [http://<Hostname>:<Port>/opview/displays/<Cluster>-<OperatorView>.html]
   
   and observe that, under the Information Group tabs, the
   returned data is preceded by the undesirable *required field
   text.
