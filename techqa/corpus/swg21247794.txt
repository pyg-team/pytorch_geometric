ABSTRACT
 Information about how changes to Daylight Saving Time (DST) in 2007 may affect systems and applications, worldwide.
This explaination also applies to Leap events like Leap Seconds. 

CONTENT
A provision of the US Energy Policy Act of 2005 extends DST by four weeks, beginning in 2007. Several countries (Canada, Bermuda) are also implementing the same DST change; other countries are expected to make similar changes.
DST in 2007 begins the second Sunday in March (11 March) and ends the first Sunday in November (4 November). Systems or applications that process dates and times could be affected by this change. If not addressed, time and date calculations could be incorrect. 

 

How do I know if my systems could be affected? [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21247794&amp;aid=1] Your systems are likely to be affected by this change, even if you are operating outside of the US. Date and time processing functions in systems and applications in countries implementing the new DST rules (U.S., Canada, Bermuda) are affected. Systems and applications in countries not implementing the DST changes could be impacted if they support users, transactions or applications originating in countries which are implementing the new DST rules. For example, scheduling or synchronizing problems may arise where systems make or check date or time stamps relating to transactions in other countries, or there may be difficulty in scheduling meetings.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21247794&amp;aid=1] The Daylight Savings Time (DST) changes do not effect the TXSeries software directly. CICS and Encina use the system clock as the time source. The system clock format for UNIX is seconds since January 1, 1970 and for Windows it is seconds since January 1,1600. When time values are used by the software they are kept in the native OS format. Usage of this method eliminates problems with the transactional work performed. 
The area where problems will be seen is in the translation of the system clock time to human understandable format. Calls are made to the operating system routines to convert the system time into a format set by the local time zone and other formatting settings. The formatted time is used in the reports generated by the software. Appropriate software patches or fixes made available by the specific OS vendor are required for the reports to reflect the correct readable time.
