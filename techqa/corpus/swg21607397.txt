CAUSE
A Cognos user session is maintained for a period of time set in Cognos Configuration (Inactivity Time-out in Seconds). The default for this is 3600s. (one hour). However, in this system the network connection between Cognos and the 3rd party authentication server is being closed due to inactivity after 360 seconds. Cognos doesn't realize this, so the if the SDK application tries to reuse the session after six minutes, we see this error.

ENVIRONMENT
RedHat Linux, Cognos 10.1.1, CA LDAP authentication server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Either increase the idle time-out in the network, or decrease the Cognos "inactivity time-out in seconds" (under "Authentication" in Cognos Configuration
