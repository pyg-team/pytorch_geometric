 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If the resource file in the RES directory (for example, C:\arscache1\0\IAA\RES) on your cache file system was accidentally removed by mistake and then you load new documents, the load action fails with an error message. See the Cause section for an example error message. 

CAUSE
The error message that appears may be similar to the following message: 

An unexpected error occurred. Contact your System Administrator and/or consult the System Log. File=arsadmp.c, Line=5097
Unable to retrieve the object >2<


ANSWER
Perform the following steps: 


1. Run the following command: 

 * arsload -nfv -h ARCHIVE -u admin -p password -a myApp -g myAppGroup -i myAFPReport.afp
 * 
 * 
 * .ind
 * 
 * .out
 * 
 *  
 * .res
 * 
 * arsload
 * 


2. Run the following command:  * arsadmin load -h ARCHIVE -u admin -p password -a myApp -g myAppGroup -r myAFPReport.afp
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * An unexpected error occurred. Contact your System Administrator and/or consult the System Log. File=arsadmp.c, Line=5097
 * 
 * Unable to retrieve the object >2
 * 
 * 
 * arsadmin load
 * 
 * -e
 * 


3. Run the following command:  * arsadmin load -h ARCHIVE -u admin -p password -a myApp -g myAppGroup 
 * -e 2
 * -r
 * myAFPReport.afp.res
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Resource x:\....\myAFPReport.afp.res will be added as resource >1-1-0<. Compression Type(OD77) Original Size(35122) Compressed Size(16641)


Now the resource file is back in the RES folder (for example, C:\arscache1\0\IAA\RES) and you can load documents again.
