ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The samples by design have the minimum # of databases, and
   that's 3 for an Advanced DE. See

   By default, the sample properties file contains properties for
   setting up four databases: CellDB, CMNDB, BPMDB, and PDWDB. If
   you want to reduce this set, for example, putting the CellDB
   tables into the CMNDB, then you need to:Set bpm.cell.db to
   SharedDB. Add CellScopedDB to the list of values for
   bpm.de.db.1.dbCapabilities, for example, so that
   bpm.de.db.1.dbCapabilities=Messaging,BusinessSpace,CommonDB,BPC,
   CellScopedDB. Delete the set of database properties that
   correspond to the fourth database, for example, all
   bpm,de.db.4.* properties.

   ****************************************************************
   The client created a
   deployment
   environment by using the BPMConfig
   command and the
   Advanced-PC-SingleCluster-DB2.propertie
   s file. The Sample configuration
   properties files for use with the
   BPMConfig command topic in the IBM
   BPM V8.5 information center says
   "By default, the sample properties
   file contains properties for setting
   up four databases: CellDB, CMNDB,
   BPMDB, and PDWDB."
   However, only the CMNDB, BPMDB, and
   PDWDB databases are created.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This topic has been updated to refer to three default
   databases instead of four.
