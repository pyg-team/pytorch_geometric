ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - Windows XP SP1
    - IBM Rational Software Architect/Modeler v6.0.0
      build 2004117_2230 +ifix002
   Reproducible Y/N: Y
   Description of problem:
   When trying to reorder messages in a sequence diagram the user
   will receive a model validation error thrown by the live
   validation interaction constraint rule preventing the message
   reordering.
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. create a sequence diagram
   2. Add 2 lifelines to the diagram
   3. Add 2 asynchronous or synchronous messages an call them
       message1 and message2
   4. Select message1 and try to move it down after message2
   -> Result:
   The model validation error appear:
   "The system cannot perform the requested action because it
    violates the integrity of the model.
    Reason:
    IRJA0249E Execution occurrence finishes before "Message
    message1" is received."
   When moving the message in the diagram, it execution occurrence
   seems
   to remain at the same location probably causing the error the be
   thrown.
   Expected:
    The message and its execution occurrence should move in one
    block/remain attached to each other.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Select the execution occurrence (or focus of control) of
      message1 and expand it so it will finish after the execution
      occurrence of message2.
   2. Then move down message1 (after execution occurrence of
      message2  finishes).
   
   -> Message 1 should not be called after message2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM RATIONAL SOFTWARE ARCHITECT: MODEL INTEGRITY ERROR WHEN
   TRYING TO MOVE A MESSAGE IN A SEQUENCE DIAGRAM
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Introduced the concept of MessageSet. A message set is a set of
   elements grouped together and treated as one atomic unit during
   the reorder operation.
   Here is a scenario to illustrate how MessageSet is used during
   Message Reordering.
   
   1) Create a modeling project named project1
   2) create a model named b.emx
   3) Add a sequence diagram (SequenceDiagram1) under b.emx
   4) Create two lifelines on the sequence diagram (lifeline1 and
   lifeline2)
   5) Create a synchronous message named Message1 between the
   lifelines
   6) Create another synchronous message named Message2 between the
   lifelines located below Message1.
   7) Select any part of Message2, right click, select "Select
   Message Set/Reorder" command. All pieces of message2 are getting
   selected as message set.
   
   8) Move the MessageSet of Message2 above Message1,
   The reorder operation should reorder the two messages.
   
   Message2 located above Message1.
