APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If customer is running DB2 with HADR setup it will prevent
   the following statement from being executed successfully:
   
   "ALTER
   TABLE
   psbpmdb.LSW_PO_VERSIONS ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY"
   
   which is part of the upgrade script for BPMDB during migration
   from BPM 7.5/8.0.x to 8.5.6.
   
   The command will fail with DB2 error:
   
   SQL0628N  Multiple or conflicting keywords involving the
   "ACTIVATE NOT
    LOGGED INITIALLY" clause are present.  SQLSTATE=42613
   
   as blognonlogged is set to true in a HADR setup to not break the
   synchronization from the primary to the secondary database.
   
   This limitation for HADR needs to be documented in the migration
   guide and customer needs to be advised to remove the above
   statement from
   
   <dmgr
   profile>\dbscripts\Upgrade\DENAME\DB2\BPMDB\upgradeSchema_Proces
   sServer.sql
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove ALTER TABLE statement
   
   "ALTER
   TABLE
   psbpmdb.LSW_PO_VERSIONS ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY"
   
   from
   
   <dmgr
   profile>\dbscripts\Upgrade\DENAME\DB2\BPMDB\upgradeSchema_Proces
   sServer.sql
