ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Quintus: 225934
   
   One of our customer - is encountering Rhapsody fatal
   error during code generation.  They originally have used
   Rhapsody 7.3.  I reproduced the issue 7.5
   
   Attached is a zip file that contains two Rhapsody models, and
   some RER files created whilst the error.
   - p1_p_timer.zip    (A model to reproduce the issue)
   - p4_s_request.zip  (A model to reproduce the isseu)
   - RER_p1_p_timer.zip   (Error log whilst using p1_p_timer)
   - RER_p4_s_request.zip (Error log whilst using p4_s_request)
   
   According to the customer, same/similar symptom occurs by using
   the other models.  I also have atteched a zip file that contains
   multiple RER files sent from the customer:
   - RER.zip
   - RER2.zip
   
   Followings are the steps to reproduce.  Please note that the
   symptom not always occur.  You have to repeat regenerating
   multiple times.  So, please be patient.  I have tried on my VM
   with 512MB and had to regenerate 5 to 20 times to repsoduce the
   issue.
   
   ***** using p1_p_timer
   (1) Start Rhapsody and open the model.  (I tried Rhapsody 7.5)
   (2) Using the Rhapsody Browser, expand 'p_timer ? Components ?
   sim ? Configurations'.
   (3) Right-click 'Animation' and select 'Generate Configuration
   Main and Makefiles'.
       (Rhapsody will show and error message due to lack of
   'Animation.cg_info'.  Ignore the message by clicking [Yes].)
   (4) After the generation is done, select menu 'Code ? Re
   Generate ? Animation'.
   (5) Repeat the operation (4) after the previous generate is
   done.
   
   Whilst regenerating the code, Rhapsody will display the
   following error dialog box:
   ?????
   Title: Rhapsody
   Message:

   Please 'Save As' your model and close Rhapsody.
   ?????
   After clicking-
   
   ***** using p4_s_request
   (1) Start Rhapsody and open the model.
   (2) Select menu 'Code ? Re Generate ? None'.
   (3) After the previous generateion ends, repeat (2).
   
   Whilst regenerating the code, Rhapsody will display the
   following error dialog box:
   ?????

   Please 'Save As' your model and close Rhapsody.
