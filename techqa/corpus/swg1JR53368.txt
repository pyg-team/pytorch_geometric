ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Process Portal V8.5.6.0, when you load a coach that
   contains the Stream coach view from the V8.5.5 Dashboards
   toolkit, the coach does not load and you  see the following
   entry in the SystemOut.log file:
   
   [5/4/15 4:58:02:605 EDT] 00000182 ServletWrappe E
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Process Portal V8.5.6.0, how a missing file is handled when
   loading a coach view was changed.  You now receive an error that
   indicates the file that is missing.  In Process Portal V8.5.5.,
   there is an incorrect reference in the Stream coach view file
   in the Dashboards toolkit that triggers the error when running
   the V8.5.5 Dashboards toolkit in Process Portal V8.5.6.0.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 is available that adds an additional
   check for the file that uses the same pattern that is in the
   V8.5.5.0 Stream coach view.
