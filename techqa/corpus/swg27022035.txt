Title: IBM FIXED: The description of the IBM FileNet Content Engine bootstrap account needs to be updated - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Descriptions of the Content Engine bootstrap account, ce_bootstrap_admin, have inaccuracies in the IBM FileNet P8 documentation. For example, this account does not need to be an application server administrative account. 

CONTENT
Replace the entire description of the ce_bootstrap_admin account, found in the IBM FileNet P8 Platform installation documentation and security help, with the following text: 

Description
The ce_bootstrap_admin, also known as the Content Engine system user, is an LDAP account that is stored in the CEMPBoot.properties file, which is archived in the Content Engine EAR file. You enter the credentials for the bootstrap account while running the Configure Bootstrap Properties task in the IBM FileNet Configuration Manager. Any deployments of the EAR file for the same FileNet P8 domain must use the same credentials for the Content Engine bootstrap account. 

Content Engine uses this account to authenticate to the application server and access the data sources named in the GCDConnection property. Content Engine will not be able to start if this user is not able to authenticate. 

In keeping with the principle of granting to an account only those permissions that are necessary to accomplish its purpose, do not use the ce_bootstrap_admin account to serve in the role of gcd_admin. This can happen if you log in as ce_bootstrap_admin the first time you start Enterprise Manager following initial Content Engine installation. Logging in this way places ce_bootstrap_admin on the security tab of the FileNet P8 domain object with Full Control access rights. The result is that the ce_bootstrap_admin is functioning as the gcd_admin. This is not a recommended configuration. If it is your configuration, consider using Enterprise Manager to add a new gcd_admin account, making sure to grant Full Control to the FileNet P8 domain, and then removing the ce_bootstrap_admin from the security tab of the FileNet P8 domain.

To make sure it is not misused or locked out by accident, do not use ce_bootstrap_admin as an all-purpose account. For example, if a user tried to log in to some other application using the ce_bootstrap_admin account and provided the wrong password several times, thereby exceeding the number of allowable login failures, the account could be locked out of the directory server, depending on your local policies. As a result, the Content Engine would not start.

If possible, exempt ce_bootstrap_admin from policies requiring periodic password change. 

If you change your system's login parameters so that the ce_bootstrap_admin credentials are no longer valid, the result would be that Content Engine will not be able to start. For example, if you modified the User Short Name Attribute or User Search Filter, in the application server's authentication provider and in Enterprise Manager's P8 Domain Properties > Modify Directory Configuration > User property sheet, from samAccountName to distinguishedName, you would also need to make the same change to the com.filenet.gcd.Username property in the CEMPBoot.properties file. 

Restriction: If you are deploying Content Engine on an application server with federated user repositories and with multiple realms, be sure that no two realms contain the same short name for this user; otherwise, the user will not be able to authenticate.

Minimum required permissions
The account must be a directory server account that resides in the realm that has been configured for Content Engine authentication.
