Title: IBM EIF Probe Error: Received a malformed alarm, Handling it as best as possible. - United States

HandleMalformedAlarms; Received a malformed alarm; Handling it as best as possible; Received a malformed alarm; Handling it as best as possible. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to integrate new event sources (eg. Mainframe, ITM) into OMNIbus seeing the error message in the log. 

SYMPTOM
 Some alerts/events are not processed correctly, and seeing "Error: Received a malformed alarm,Handling it as best as possible." error message in the EIF probe debug log.


CAUSE
This error message is usually seen in EIF log when "invalid chars" are present in the event/alert that came from mainframe environments via event pump, using postemsg utility, from ITM, etc. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Probe for Tivoli EIF can perceive an alarm that has a back slash (\) in its messages as a malformed alarm. 

However, parsing of these malformed alarms occurs only when the HandleMalformedAlarms property is set as true. If the property is set as false, the probe rejects the malformed alarms. The probe logs the error message.

Verify the event details/data, raw capture file, debug log file, and event source for potential invalid (and control chars). Modify the event data to not to contain these offending characters.
