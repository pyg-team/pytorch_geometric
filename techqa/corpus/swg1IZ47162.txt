APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  According to the TDWC installation and troubleshooting guide
   there is no need to run a manage_ltpa.sh after enabling the z/OS
   connector to use WEBUI with 'webui.sh -enable' script.
   manage_ltpa.sh is only used if the WEBUI is define as SSO.
   
   After installing TDWC you can see errors AWSUI0766E AWSUI0833E.
   
   The problem you got is related to the realm value of the
   user registry you are using on WebSphere. The problem happens
   when the realm value is the same for both Websphere server
   (TDWC and TWS zOS connector, or TWS engine).
   In these circumstances it needs to export/import the LTPA keys
   in order to align them  on all websphere server configuration.
   This steps usually is documented only when you want to configur
   the Single Sign On, but is required also when you have the same
   realm.
   
   There is the same realm value in the following cases:
   - when configuring all websphere server with an LDAP
   - when installing all websphere server on the same machine.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run manage_ltpa.sh
