Title: IBM Error loading Web SSO Configuration due to missing ICC library - United States

PROBLEM
After creating/modifying a Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration document in Lotus Domino, you attempt to load the HTTP task and receive one of the following errors: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
   "HTTP Server: Error loading Web SSO Configuration 'LtpaToken' (Single Sign-On configuration is invalid)"

After enabling Debug_SSO_Trace_Level=2, and attempting to reload HTTP, you see the following output indicating that there was a problem loading the ICC library: 

 * 
 * 

SYMPTOM
HTTP fails to load Web SSO Configuration document.


CAUSE
This problem occurs when the server is unable to load the ICC library files from their default directory:


<Domino program directory>\domino_icc\icc\icclib\icclib.dll
<Domino program directory>\domino_icc\icc\osslib\libeay32.dll

These files constitute the FIPS 140-2 certified cryptography library used by the server for some types of document encryption. The files are needed when attempting to load a SSO document created by later releases of the Notes client.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In one case, replacing the domino_icc directory from a working server resolved the issue.
