Title: IBM Spectrum Protect Server DB2 installation may fail with ANRI1020E RC 1639 - United States

Text:
TSM Tivoli Storage Manager DB2 installation TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Spectrum Protect Server installation may fail to install to a non-default installation path. 

SYMPTOM
The Spectrum Protect Server installation might fail with a message similar to the following: 

ANRI1020E: The DB2 installation failed. To review errors and correct 
any issues, review C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation 
Manager\logs\native\tsm_logs\db2_install.log. 

where the "db2_install.log" is empty.


CAUSE
There is a whitespace ("blank") in the non-default installation path.


ENVIRONMENT
Spectrum Protect Server on Windows platform



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Under the technote condition, within the Installation Manager "C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation 

Manager\logs\native" log folder, the latest installation log file named 
<DATE>_<TIME>.log shows a message like the following: 

Command: "D:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\db2tmp\ESE\image\setup.exe" /f /i 
en /u "D:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\db2tmp\db2resp.tmp" /l 
"C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation 
Manager\logs\native\tsm_logs\db2_install.log" 
stdout: 

stderr: 

RC: 1639


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
RC 1639 is returned from the MSIEXEC package and it means "an invalid argument was passed to setup.exe". 


In this case the installation path has a whitespace ("blank") in the directory name "D:\Program Files". If you remove the whitespace from the installation path, for example change it to "D:\ProgramFiles", the installation completes.
