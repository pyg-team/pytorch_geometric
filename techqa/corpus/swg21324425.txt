QUESTION
 What is the difference between an exclusive lock and a shareable lock in IBM Rational DOORS manage locks utility? 

CAUSE
Closing a module opened in exclusive edit mode leaves a shareable lock in place 

ANSWER
There are two types of lock that can be placed on a folder/project: Shareable lock - is put in place when users open a folder/project; this doesn't prevent other users from opening the same folder/project. Exclusive lock - is put in place when a user is moving, deleting, copying folders/projects. This means that no other user has access to this project/folder.
