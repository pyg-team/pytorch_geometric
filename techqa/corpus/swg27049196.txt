SOLVED PROBLEMS
 1.  Problem description Under rare conditions, a reload of a segmented table might not be completed. 
    Symptom: Error message "StoredProcedureException: An internal error occurred on the ' ' accelerator..:" Problem conclusion The problem has been fixed. 
 2.  Problem description You might see a performance degradation if you reload the same partitioned table over and over again. Problem conclusion The problem has been fixed. 




 

MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS
There are no migration considerations.  



 

CONDITIONS FOR QUERY ROUTING
Queries can be routed to an accelerator only if certain conditions are met. There are also adverse conditions that prohibit query acceleration.  For more information please see Conditions for query routing to an accelerator [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4LQ8_6.1.0/com.ibm.datatools.aqt.doc/gui/concepts/c_idaa_query_offloading_criteria.html] 



 

KNOWN ISSUES
 1.  Currently IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Cloud Support cannot handle queries that reference system-temporal or business-temporal tables. This means that queries containing one or more of the following clauses cannot be accelerated:  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF
    FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM ... TO ...
    FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN ... AND ...
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME AS OF
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME FROM ... TO ...
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME BETWEEN ... AND... 
    
    
 2.  Currently IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Cloud Support cannot handle queries that reference timestamp columns encoded in EBCDIC. Workaround: If possible, use Unicode-encoded timestamp columns. 
 3.  In rare situations the accelerator could crash unexpectedly during a table load, but recovers automatically. Workaround: Restart load job. 
 4.  Under rare circumstances, a load of a table which was previously removed and then added again, may abort. Workaround:  1.  Remove the table again. 
     2.  Add the table again. 
     3.  Load the newly added table.
