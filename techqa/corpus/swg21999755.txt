QUESTION
How do I add default Widgets (apps) to the "Updates" section on Homepage?

ANSWER
The solution to add the Default Widgets available on "My Page" to the "Updates" section of homepage, is to create new Widgets that mirror the already existing Default Widgets.


To create Widgets which can be added to the "Updates" page:
1. Log into Connections Homepage as an administrator user. 

2. Click on "Administration" on the homepage

3. From this page you'll see all the enabled/disabled widgets. Find the widget(s) that you'd like to add to the "Updates" page, and hit "edit".

4. Copy all the data in each of the fields - you'll use this to create a new widget in a moment.
5. Exit the widget properties, and click on "Add another app" on the Administration page. This will begin creating a new widget from a blank template.
6. Fill in the fields in this new widget with the data from the widget you just copied from. Make sure the data matches identically to the default widget's values.
Note: It's recommended that you use a different "App Title" so that you can differentiate the default widget and new widget in the "Enabled Apps" list.
7. Make sure to check the box for the "Display on Updates page" option. Otherwise, make sure all other options match the default widget identically.

8. Save the new Widget. This will return you to the Administration page - make sure to highlight the new Widget in the "Disabled Apps" list, and click on Enable.
9. Navigate to the "Updates" page (with any user), and click on "Customize" at the top right - the new widget you just created should be an option. Click on the + to add this Widget to the page.
