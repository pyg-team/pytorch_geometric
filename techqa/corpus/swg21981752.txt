Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Portions of IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software are shipped as a component of Rational Developer for i (RPG and COBOL + Modernization Tools, Java and EGL editions), and Rational Developer for AIX and Linux.
OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 1, 2016 by the OpenSSL project. OpenSSL is used by the Cordova tools in IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software. IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software has addressed the applicable CVEs (CVE-2016-0705, CVE-2016-0798, CVE-2016-0797, CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-0702, CVE-2016-0703, CVE-2016-0704). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0705 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-0798 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0798] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in SRP servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted username value to cause a denial of service. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111141 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111141] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-0797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0797] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to cause a denial of service. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0799 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory error in the BIO_*printf() functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to trigger an out-of-bounds read. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0702 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover RSA keys. 


CVSS Base Score: 2.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0703 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0703] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to enforce that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers by the SSLv2 's2_srvr.c code. When clear-key bytes displace encrypted-key bytes, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct a divide-and-conquer key recovery attack. 


CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0704 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0704] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. The s2_srvr.c code overwrites the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Bleichenbacher oracle to decrypt sessions. 


CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146] for the current score
