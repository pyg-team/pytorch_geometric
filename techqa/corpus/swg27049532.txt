Many customers suffer with Guardium Appliances filling up and often remedial action is only taken once the system has become full and Technical Support is engaged. This Open Mic will introduce a prototype dashboard that can be used to provide Guardium Administrators with a quick visual check for various spikes on the Appliance over the last Month. Along with the usual Alerts, the dashboard can be used to proactively fix increased DB Usage and System Usage problems before the system fills.

The Open Mic will allow for feedback on the concept as well as discussion of what other reports / tools are used by customers to monitor and react to the Appliance space filling.

The webcast is provided by IBM Security Guardium Technical Support. Our goal is to provide insight and to teach on-going sessions that help both users and administrators understand, maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with their IBM Security products. Throughout the event, attendees will be encouraged to comment or ask questions in the Q&A Panel within the WebEx conference. Join us for this interactive, educational, and lively session.
