ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
   
   
   Customer created MST file using the "InstallShieldTuner for
   LotusNotes": All
   necessary MUI and Multiuser features have been selected to be
   installed on the
   hdd. The option ApplicationUsers in Application Configuration >
   Setup
   Properties has been set to AllUsers. AgreeToLicence has been set
   to "Yes" as
   well. The files from web download from passport advantage have
   been used for
   MST: C897FDE.exe (German Client only). The package is being
   installed by
   Marimba using a component called Tuner.  Marimba (Tuner) is
   installing the
   package with the normal msiexec command: msiexec /i MSI-path
   Transforms=MST-path /qn. The difference which causes the problem
   is that
   Marimba (Tuner) uses the built-in Windows (Win XP) system
   account called
   "System" to process the msiexec command. This user has
   administration right by
   default and is not "logged-in" like a user/person. But the Lotus
   Notes client
   won't be installed until a normal user is logged in. This is
   being caused by
   "user" specific data which can't be written because the folder
   or registry keys
   are not available. For example the installation log will be
   saved within the
   "My Documents" folder of the current user. Unfortunately the
   built-in Windows
   system account called "System" does not posses such a folder.
   well) using the
   built-in Windows "System" account.
   
   Environment: Notes Client 7.0.1 German, client only multi-user
   on Windows XP
   
   Request - adjust the MST in order to install Lotus Notes
   avoiding any user
   defined components in order to create a real shared
   installation.
   
   Other info:
   
   End-users must have Administrator rights to choose a multi-user
   installation
   and must only install the Notes Client. End-users must also have
   Administrator
   rights to upgrade an existing multi-user installation.
   1. From Application Configuration, select Setup Properties.
   2. Change the value in the ApplicationUsers property to
   AllUsers. By default
   the installation is now a multi-user installation.
   
   A Multi-user installation will create user specific directories
   by default. The
   executables are in a single location and the shared data
   directory is in
   \Document Setting\All Users\Application Data\Lotus\Data folder.
   Each user in
   the Multi-user installation will also have their own data
   directory in the
   c:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Application
   Data\Lotus\Notes Data
   
   There is no difference regarding rights to the OS for a single
   or multi-user
   install - they both write the same registry keys only with
   different values.
   And the windows System account has Administration rights (not
   only during the
   installation) as for the windows System account will always have
   Administration
   rights on a machine. The Core Notes Data files are created in
   the "\Document
   Setting\AllUsers\Application Data\Lotus\Data" folder during the
   installation of
   the Multi-user client. The individuals data folder under ->
   "C:\Documents and
   Settings\%user%\Local Settings\Application
   Data\Lotus\Notes\Data" are created
   when the user clicks the Notes Icon on the desktop to setup the
   client the
   first time.
   
   At the moment it seems that a user has to be logged in. Because
   the setup
   process needs to create the install log file within the "My
   Documents"
   directory of the current (logged in) user, as well as to create
   several
   registry keys within HKEY_CURRENT_USER and other things. So
   there doesn't seem
   to be a way to do a silent install using the built-in Windows
   System account,
   as users do not have their own user directory nor any registry
   keys in
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
