Title: IBM PI73816: REFRESH ITEMS TASK INCORRECTLY PROCESSING ALL ITEMS FROM CURRENT REPOSITORY WHEN IMPORTING SITE CREATION SYSTEM LIBRARY - United States

Text:
  A FIX IS AVAILABLE
Fixes integrated in WebSphere Portal 8.5.0.0 and V9.0 Combined Cumulative Fixes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037786]



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the site creation system library is created internally via
   a library import process (ie: creating a new virtual portal or
   
   the initial server startup during migration), the refresh items
   task that is executed is incorrectly querying and processing
   all
   items across all libraries from the current repository. The
   
   refresh items task should instead be processing items from the
   
   newly imported library only.
   
   
   
   As a result of this issue, the initial server startup during
   
   migration can take a long time to complete as this task is
   
   incorrectly processing every item across all items on the
   
   system. Additionally, creating a new virtual portal on a
   
   environment with the Managed Pages feature disabled and also
   
   with large amounts of data can take a very long time to
   complete
   due to the same problem.
