QUESTION
 How can I restore missing or corrupted xml files in the WEB-INF directory, (such as the navigation.xml, portletEntities.xml, etc.) from backup in Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) ? 

CAUSE
Some of these files could have gotten corrupted. 

ANSWER
DASH makes a backup copy of the WEB-INF configuration/custom xml files in the backups directory. These files are very useful if any of these files get corrupted. 

Please follow below steps to restore files from the backups directory: 

1. Stop the DASH server 

2. Make a backup copy of the current xml files in the following directory: 

<JazzSM_Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

3. Go to <JazzSM_Home>/profile/backups and find a backup file from a previous day/time that contains the missing xml files 

Example: isc_stores_backup_1427324004938.zip 

4. Unpack the zip file to a temporary location. 

5. Restore these files in the WEB-INF directory from the backup. 

6. Start DASH 

7. Test if you can access the DASH Portal.
