SUMMARY
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) padding vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack affects IBM Rational DOORS. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]
Description: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.


CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The vulnerable components are used when Rational DOORS is configured to use OSLC remote services and in internal communication between the Rational DOORS client and server. 



Rational DOORS Status 9.3.x Affected 9.4.x Affected 9.5.x Affected 9.6.x Affected WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Set an environment variable to avoid the vulnerability (clients and servers) 

To avoid the vulnerability, you must set the environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES to GSK_TRUE for all processes that will run Rational DOORS code. 

 

Rational DOORS component Setting the EV Rational DOORS client, database server, interoperation server Set the environment variable as a user or system environment variable. You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
