 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 WebSphere Community Edition, WebSphere Liberty Profile, and an IBM JRE are shipped as components of Web Experience Factory. WebSphere Dashboard Framework (an extension built on top of Web Experience Factory) also uses these components. Information about a security vulnerability affecting WebSphere Community Edition and WebSphere Liberty Profile has been published in security bulletins. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
WebSphere Community Edition, WebSphere Liberty Profile, and the IBM JRE shipped with Web Experience Factory are optional components installed and used on developer workstations. If you have installed these optional components then please review the notes below. If you have not installed these components then you should contact the provider of your development application server to determine if it is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3566 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566].
Please consult the following security bulletins for vulnerability details and information about fixes for WebSphere Community Edition and WebSphere Liberty Profile. Note that the bulletin for WebSphere Community Edition only applies to the 3.0.0.4 release and is provided as a convenience for customers that may have upgraded to this more recent version. The majority of customers will have version 2.1.1.2 or 2.1.1.5 which shipped with Web Experience Factory releases prior to 8.5. Instructions for addressing CVE-2014-3566 in 2.1.1.2 and 2.1.1.5 are provided below. WebSphere Liberty Profile 8.5.5.1 shipped with Web Experience Factory 8.5 and the Liberty bulletin referenced below should be used.

Security Bulletin: Disabling SSLv3 and SSLv2 in WebSphere Application Server Community Edition 3.0.0.4 for the SSLv3 CVE-2014-3566 POODLE issue [https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/ibm-security-bulletin-disabling-sslv3-and-sslv2-in-websphere-application-server-community-edition-3-0-0-4-for-the-sslv3-cve-2014-3566-poodle-issue/]

Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]

In WebSphere Community Edition 2.1.1.2 and 2.1.1.5 you can disable SSLv3 by changing the value of sslProtocol in the TomcatWebSSLConnector XML found in <WASCE_HOME>\var\config\config.xml. The example below illustrates the required change. 

<gbean name="TomcatWebSSLConnector">
...
<attribute name="sslProtocol">TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</attribute>
...
</gbean>

The IBM JREs bundled with Web Experience Factory (WEF) and WebSphere Dashboard Framework (WDF) have been updated to disable SSLv3 by default. Customers that have installed the JRE bundled with WEF or WDF should update that JRE to ensure their development environments are not vulnerable to CVE-2014-3566. Obtain the JRE update appropriate for you product from Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

Description: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused 
by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a 
man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On 
Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSLsessions and access the plaintext of 
encrypted connections.
