Title: IBM Migrating InfoSphere Warehouse V10:  All new side-by-side vs. Re-using old components - United States

 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 If you currently use InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7 and want to migrate to V10.1 on the same computer, you must decide between two migration scenarios. The difference between the scenarios depends on the choices you make during installation about how to use DB2 and WebSphere Application. 

CONTENT
The migration scenarios are: 

 

 1. Side-by-Side: Your installation of InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1 (including DB2 and WebSphere Application Server) is completely separate in your environment from your installation of InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7 (including DB2 and WebSphere Application Server). The two installations are independent and run side-by-side. This scenario is useful if you want to continue running both versions. For example, you might want to install a separate copy of V10.1 on a development system so you can test your applications without disrupting production. 
 2. Your installation of InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1 re-uses the copies of DB2 and WebSphere Application Server that you have been using with InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7. This scenario is useful when you are ready to deploy V10.1 across your enterprise. For example, when you are satisfied that your applications work with V10.1, you can install V10.1 on your production systems and re-use the existing copies of DB2 and WebSphere Application Server. 


The scenario that is right for you depends on the needs of your enterprise and the environment in which you are installing InfoSphere Warehouse. After you complete the installation of V10.1, the steps of migrating data resources and metadata are the same for both scenarios. 


Scenario 1: Side-by-Side Installation (Co-existence of V9.7 and V10) 

InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1 is installed on the same computer as V9.7, but does not share any of the old components of V9.7. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=1] 

This is the most common scenario for computers that host both development and production environments, and is recommended. Under this scenario, both releases co-exist without affecting each other. 

You do not have to migrate your existing databases that contain your source and target data. (These databases are usually separate from the database that contains the warehouse metadata.) You can connect your new InfoSphere Warehouse v10 to your existing source databases as long as they are on DB2 9.5 or DB2 9.7. If you choose to migrate your source databases, see the following document for instructions: 
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.migrate.doc/migrating_db2server_db.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.migrate.doc/migrating_db2server_db.html] 

If you want to migrate your WebSphere Application Server profile, you must perform this task before starting the InfoSphere Warehouse installation program. Follow the migration instructions for your version of WebSphere Application Server: 
 * WebSphere Application Server V7:http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/welc6topmigrating.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/welc6topmigrating.html] 
 * WebSphere Application Server V8: http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/welc6topmigrating.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/welc6topmigrating.html]


Now you can start the installation. Read the installation instructions in the information center: 
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.install.doc/install_intro.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.install.doc/install_intro.html] 

During installation, please note: 
 1. When you install DB2, either using the DB2 installation program or the InfoSphere Warehouse installation program, you must specify a new DB2 installation path that is different from the existing installation of DB2 on that computer. 
 2. It is recommended that you do not accept the default name of SQWCTRL for the metadata database, or any database names, in the new InfoSphere Warehouse installation. This makes it easier to distinguish between the two installations. 


After you finish installation, you can start the migration process by following the migration instructions in the information center: 
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.migrate.doc/migrating_isw.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.dwe.migrate.doc/migrating_isw.html] 


Scenario 2: Re-use existing installations of DB2 and WebSphere Application Server 

Both V9.7 and V10.1 are installed on the same computer, but now V10.1 is reusing the existing instances of DB2 and WebSphere Appliation Server [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=2] 

In this scenario, you install InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1 and re-use the installations of DB2 server and WebSphere Application Server that you used with InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7. 

1. Before you launch the installation program for InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1, if your existing DB2 server is associated with InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7, then you must rename or remove the file called warehouse.ast in the directory in which DB2 is installed. For example, by default, on Linux or UNIX, the file is this directory: /opt/IBM/ISWarehouse/db2/V9.7. Similarly, if you want to re-use the existing profile for WebSphere Application Server, you must delete the *.ast files from the WebSphere installation directory. 

2. Launch the installation program for InfoSphere Warehouse 10.1 and select an installation location that is different from the V9.7 location. In the following example, the location for V10.1 is C:\Program Files\IBM\ISWarehouse 10 , which is different from the V9.7location , C:\Program Files\IBM\ISWarehouse

3. Create a new package group. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=4] 


4. When you are prompted for a DB2 server to use with InfoSphere Warehouse V10.1, select the DB2 server copy that you used previously with V9.7. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=5] 


5. On the Custom Information screen, you must specify a new name for your new metadata database for V10.1 that is different from the name of your V9.7 metadata database. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=6] 


6. Select your existing installation of WebSphere Application Server, but make sure that you create a new profile for V10.1. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=7] 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592583&aid=8] 


After you finish installation, you can start the migration process by following the migration instructions in the information center:
