Title: IBM Known Issue: Internet Explorer stops responding when you use drag and drop to move properties from a property table container in Properties View Designer. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Internet Explorer stops responding when you use drag and drop to move properties from a property table container in Properties View Designer. 

SYMPTOM
In Case Manager Builder, you can design a custom property view with Properties View Designer. One of the containers that you can use in a custom property view is the property table container. 

If you add multiple property fields to a property table container and then later move these fields from the property table container by dragging and dropping the property to an area outside of the property table container, the browser stops responding when you move the last property field from the property table container. 

This problem occurs only with Microsoft Internet Explorer.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not use drag and drop to remove a property field from the property table container. Instead use 'cut' and 'paste' or 'delete' to remove the property field. 

An alternative is to use a different browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
