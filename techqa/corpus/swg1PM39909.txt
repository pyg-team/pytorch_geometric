ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Need ideas on how to proceed given the errors seen
   below.??Customer has a big macro with several nested Admin links
   that have sporadically failed for many weeks.  Some days no
   failures, some days 2 failures in a row then success with no
   apparent changes.   We have narrowed it down to a particular
   Admin link.  Source app is 4.2 million cells. Target app is 8.7
   million cells.  Admin link is tuned and targeting
   Production.??Below is part of the error.  Full error #1 in
   Testcase tab.??Unable determine exportqueue information for
   'PMLPR.wdshe_fcst_3'??The interesting part is that there are no
   rows in any of the 4 export tables in either app when the error
   is thrown.??We've also seen the same admin link fail with a
   "ADODB.Recordset" error.   Full error #2 in Testcase
   tab.???These we have tried:??Corrected the elist structure of
   one app and verified the correct structure of the
   other.?Increased available table space.?Introduced wait
   statements on source app prior to admin link execution.?Ruled
   out a bad server?Ruled out memory fragmentation.???Things
   considering:??enabling volatile DB2 setting on both
   apps?targeting development within admin link?increasing export
   tidy jobs to run daily.??Due to the number of applications
   involved in the macro, an in house testcase would be a very
   large task.??Recently the large macro was moved to a QA env
   where the apps were only partly full of data.  The macro has
   been executed hourly and has been completing successful for a
   few days.
