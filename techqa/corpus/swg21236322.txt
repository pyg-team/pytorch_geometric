   Important Note: New appliances purchased from the Passport Advantage (PA) site are Machine Type (M/T) 2426 (XI52 and XG45) or 8436 (IDG).
   The 2426 M/T includes the new 7198 and 7199 appliances purchased from PA.
   The firmware will still report the M/T of 7199 or 7198 but if use these the PMR may not be entitled correctly.
   See this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666811] for details and how to store the 2426 M/T in the firmware for easy access:
