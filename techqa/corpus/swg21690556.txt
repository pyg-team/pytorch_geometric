Title: IBM How to change the virtual machine name in VMware - United States

Text:
VMware UUID instance name ICO TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you change the name of the virtual machine that is used with IBM Cloud Orchestrator? 

CAUSE
By default, IBM Cloud Orchestrator names VMware virtual machines by UUID. 
You might need to see the real host name in the VMware infrastructure instead of the generated UUID.

The VMWare virtual machines that are deployed by OpenStack are only named by the UUID, which is the instance UUID on the OpenStack side. 

Support does not exist for creating a virtual machine with a host name.


ANSWER
This feature is planned to be releases in a future fix pack. 


In order to provide relief until the feature is officially available, contact IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/us/#techsup] to request the Limited Availability interim fix (LA_iFix) to enable this functionality in your environment.


 * Clients running IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4.0.1 request LA_iFix005 
 * Clients running IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4.0.2 request LA_iFix002 


Complete the following steps:

 1. Install IBM Cloud Orchestrator LA_iFix as instructed by IBM Support
    
    
 2. In the [VMware] section of the /etc/nova/nova.conf file, set the following configuration value:
    
    use_displayname_uuid_for_vmname = true
    
    
 3. Save the updated /etc/nova/nova.conf file.


You can now create a virtual machine with a host name.
