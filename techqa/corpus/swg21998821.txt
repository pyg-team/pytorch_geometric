QUESTION
 Why can't I create add more than one Box Collaboration for a case and a task? Is it working as designed? 

ANSWER
This is working by design. The architecture for Box Collaboration has one Box folder for the case, which is intended for external collaboration. You can also create sub-folders under the Box collaboration folder.
