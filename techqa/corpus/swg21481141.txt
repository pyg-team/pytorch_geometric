 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have SPSS Statistics installed, but viewing the installation directory shows echoid.dat but not echoid.exe.
What is required to generate a PC's machine locking code? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have installed SPSS Statistics and are having difficulty generating your machine locking code, please follow the steps below:

1. Download the executable file (echoid.exe), which is attached to this resolution. 
2. When prompted, save the echoid.exe file into the installation directory of SPSS Statistics.
3. Open My Computer and navigate to the installation directory of SPSS Statistics.
4. Double-click on the newly saved echoid.exe file and a command prompt window will appear showing your machine lock code.

Another method for obtaining a machine lock code is via the License Authorization Wizard. In Statistics 17 and 18, a lock code is displayed in the second screen of the wizard.
You can start the wizard in Windows via the Start > All Programs > SPSS inc > Statistics 17 or PASW Statistics 18 > License Authorization Wizard
On the Product Authorization screen, a lock code is displayed in bold, black writing near the bottom of the wizard.

Please provide your Lock Code to the IBM SPSS representative
