   This APAR extends socket domain to support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.
   Previously CICS sockets domain only supported SSL V3 and
   TLS 1.0.
   
   This APAR also provides support for a new socket domain SSL
   environment which is suitable for implementing the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication
   (SP) 800-131A guidelines document.

COMMENTS
 *  CICS sockets domain is changed to support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.
   Previously CICS sockets domain only supported SSL V3 and
   TLS 1.0.
   
   The 2 new protocols can be exploited in combination with the old
   protocols by setting the SIT ENCRYPTION parameter to a new value
   of ENCRYPTION=ALL.
   
   In addition, the TLS 1.2 protocol can be activated on its own -
   with the lower level protocols disabled by using another new
   ENCRYPTION value of ENCRYPTION=TLS12FIPS. This option also
   activates FIPS processing mode in the SSL environment
   established by CICS.
   
   The use of ENCRYPTION=TLS12FIPS creates an environment which
   enables a CICS system to be configured to comply with the
   NIST SP800-131A guidelines document.
   
   In order to exploit the extended set of CIPHER suites which TLS
   1.2 supports, CICS is further enhanced to provide a new way of
   specifying CIPHERS for the following 3 CICS resource
   definitions :-
   
   IPCONN
   TCPIPSERVICE
   URIMAP
   
   The EXEC CICS WEB OPEN command does not support the use of a
   CIPHERS file name in its CIPHERS option. EXEC CICS WEB OPEN
   needs to reference a URIMAP in order to exploit support for
   CIPHERS files.
   
   The CIPHERS option of these 3 resources can now optionally
   contain the name of a CIPHERS file held on zFS.
   The TCPIPSSLCIPHERS option of the CPSM WUI can also contain
   the name of a CIPHERS file.
   
   CICS is providing 3 sample CIPHERS files in the following new
   zFS sub-directory
   
   USSHOME/security/ciphers
   
   These files are named :-
   
   strongciphers.xml   - designed for use with ENCRYPTION=STRONG
   allvalidciphers.xml - designed for use with ENCRYPTION=ALL
   fipsciphers.xml     - designed for use with ENCRYPTION=TLS12FIPS
   
   Additionally, a new SIT option is created called USSCONFIG.
   The USSCONFIG system initialization parameter specifies the name
   and path of the root directory for CICS Transaction Server
   configuration files on z/OS UNIX.
   
   CICS searches directory USSCONFIG/security/ciphers for CIPHERS
   files when a CICS resource definition references a CIPHERS file
   name.
   This means that setting USSCONFIG to the USSHOME value will
   allow CICS to locate the 3 new sample CIPHERS files.
   CIPHERS file names such as 'fipsciphers.xml' are limited to
   a length of 28-characters.
   
   Additionally, the REXX sample DFH$RING which is used to
   generate a RACF KEYRING and populate it with self-signed
   certificates has been enhanced.
   DFH$RING now generates a new certificate authority ( CERTAUTH )
   certificate which is a 2048bit RSA certificate. This is used to
   sign a 2048bit RSA PERSONAL certificate which is suitable for
   using with IPCONN, TCPIPSERVICE, URIMAP and the CERTIFICATE
   option of EXEC CICS WEB OPEN command. This strength of
   certificate complies with the NIST SP800-131A standard.
   
   
   A number of documentation updates have been made to the CICS
   Transaction Server for z/OS Version 5 Release 1 manuals and
   Information Center in support of this APAR. The changes should
   be available by the end of December 2013.
