don't turn on debug mode in production, because debug mode will impact the performance or 
collect sensitive data unless suggested otherwise after further investigation) 
- Is this working in any of your other environments? (If it's working in one environment and not in another environment, please provide information to compare the two environment (configuration, versions, ifix level, same customization, etc.)) 
- Have you seen this issue on a different environment(dev/test/qa) ? 
E. What steps have already been tried to resolve the issue ? 
F. What changes have been made recently when the issue started occurring ? 
G. Was new functionality is recently added to the application? 
H. Was the software or hardware recently upgraded?
