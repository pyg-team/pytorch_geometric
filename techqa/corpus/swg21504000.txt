Title: IBM Current Bandwidth is displaying wrong values - United States

Network utilization current bandwidth windows OS agent typeperf incorrect microsoft interface TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Windows OS agent attribute Network Interface/Current Bandwidth displays incorrect values on TEP 

SYMPTOM
E.g. a network interface can show a bandwidth of 1.4 Gb instead of the real 10 Gb

CAUSE
Some background info about the way ITM collects data: 

the Windows OS agent uses perfmon counters, without calculation, to get data for the Current Bandwidth and Bytes_Total/sec attributes.
The agent then uses these counters to calculate the Bandwidth Utilization percentage, using the following formula:
100 * ((8 * Bytes_Total/sec) / Current_Bandwidth)


ENVIRONMENT
Windows OS agent



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You will need to check first which values perfmon is supplying to the Windows OS agent. 

You can use the typeperf utility:
open a DOS command prompt, and run these commands to check which values perfmon is actually providing:
typeperf "\Network Interface(*)\Current Bandwidth"
typeperf "\Network Interface(*)\Bytes Total/sec"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In case these values are not correct, you should take this up with Microsoft. 

We have reviewed this with Microsoft in the past and it was told that "Perfmon may return illegal value when Network card is overloaded.".
So it is something that you may need to take up with Microsoft to verify this is the case.
