Title: IBM Why aren't Person Change Alerts being sent for re-activated users? - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Person Change Alerts are set up with IBM Atlas,, but there are no alerts for users who were deactivated then reactivated. Why? 

CAUSE
Person Change Alerts are a useful tool, and it would be especially useful to know when users who were deactivated have been reactivated within the company. Paralegals and Attorneys may need to add these users back to certain holds, interviews, and collections immediately.

ANSWER
For the change alert rules set up for the users not receiving the appropriate alerts, you will need to add the "New" checkbox. 

If unsure how to do this, go to Admin > Roles, find the role(s) of your user(s) you're testing with, and look at the "Change Alert Rule" setting at the top of the page. Then, go to Admin > Change Alert Rules, find the alert rules being used, click "Edit", and look for the "Person Change Alert" section

However, by doing this, you will also receive alerts for any truly new users to Atlas, not just reactivated one. Atlas doesn't have a way of differentiating between reactivated users and truly new users. To Atlas, they're the same thing: it's someone whose status column is "Active" and it wasn't set to that before. 

You will have to decide which is more important: receiving person change alerts when a user is reactivated, or not receiving person change alerts when someone is newly entered into Atlas 
for the first time.
