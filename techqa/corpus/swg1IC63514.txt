ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some reports in Tivoli Common Reporting  in Tivoli Storage
   Manager Administration Center may be returned with no data
   displayed while a verification from the DB2 warehouse database
   shows that data was collected for the indicated reports.
   
   The problem occurs when the user sets the vacation and shift
   options in the summarization and pruning agent configuration
   settings.
   Basically, the reports are not querying this option correctly.
   It was also detected that for each generated report those
   options are not queried consistently.
   
   All reports can be potentially affected.
   
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   
   6.1 Reporting and Monitoring

   from the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services , right click on
   "warehouse summarization and pruning agent"  -> Reconfigure ->
   ok -> ok -> The shift and vacation setting can be seen in the
   "work days" tab.
