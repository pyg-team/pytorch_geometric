PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to find IBM WebSphere MQ clients which support 64-bit applications. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere MQ 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 support 64-bit applications natively on several platforms. 

Download SupportPac MQC71 (for V7.1) or MQC75 (for V7.5) or MQC8 (for V8.0) or MQC9 (for V9.0) in order to use MQ 64-bit client support on the following platforms: 

 *  AIX HP-UX on PA-RISC (not supported any more in MQ 7.1) HP-UX on Itanium Linux on POWER Linux on x86-64 Linux on zSeries (64-bit s390x) Solaris on SPARC Solaris on x86-64 

Unless otherwise noted, these clients also support 32-bit applications, or in the case of the Linux on zSeries client, 31-bit applications. 

Note: The 64-bit client SupportPacs for MQ V6 are no longer supported.
