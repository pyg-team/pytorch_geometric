CAUSE
When Maximo Integration Framework processing imported data to Maximo table, it need validate the key to understand whether it should UPDATE existed record or CREATE a new record. 

By default, the key used by MIF for the parent object is the attributes associated with the primarykeycolseq values defined via Database Configuration application. 

 

Below is an example for JOBPLAN object. Key is combined with 'JPNUM','ORGID','SITEID' and 'PLUSCREVNUM' fields.

If MIF couldn't retrieve the key info from imported data file for some reason, error 'BMXAA5681E' would be detected and import operation would be failed. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You could enable 'DEBUG' log level of 'Integration' root logger to check what key MIF is looking at and what's the key's value being retrieved(see below)
