 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to add to or retrieve documents from FileNet Content Platform Engine due to CONTENT_SA_UNKNOWN_CLASS and CONTENT_FCA_FAILED_STAKEFILE_LOAD errors in the p8_server_error.log file 

CAUSE
The CONTENT_SA_UNKNOWN_CLASS and CONTENT_FCA_FAILED_STAKEFILE_LOAD errors in the p8_server_error.log file indicate the storage area did not correctly initialize on Content Platform Engine startup. The storage area has not initialized successfully because the Content Platform Engine is unable to access that storage area's fn_stakefile.xml.

ENVIRONMENT
Content Platform Engine

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The p8_server_error.log file contains errors similar to the following: 

CSTG FNRCC0142E - ERROR method name: createContentArea principal name: <ce_user> Global Transaction: false User Transaction: false Exception Info: Unknown StorageArea class com.filenet.apiimpl.core.FileStorageAreaImpl.
