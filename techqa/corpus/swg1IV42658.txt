PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM for SOA customers monitoring Message
   * Broker V8.0.0.1 and later and using the first-class Service
   * creation feature.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The first-class Service creation feature
   * introduced in Message Broker V8.0.0.1 uses SOAP nodes to
   * implement message flows, but has changed the location of the
   * SOAP input message information supplied during the user exit
   * procedure. The Data Collector for Websphere Message Broker can
   * not locate the required Service Port Name and Operation Name
   * in the message information and returns empty fields.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply ITCAM for Transactions 7.3.0.1
   * Limited Availability fix LA0031.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Data Collector for Websphere Message
   Broker V7.3.0.1 has been altered to tolerate SOAPInput nodes
   created using the first-class Service creation feature. It will
   report the string "UNKNOWN" when the Service Port Name and
   Operation Name for a SOAPInput node can not be found.
