LOCAL FIX
 *  To minimize the possibility of a log roll over during
   installation,
   perform the following steps prior to the upgrade:
   
   1. Open impactserver.log4j.properties and lower the log setting
   by
   removing/replacing DEBUG entries with INFO.
   
   /opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/etc/impactserver.log4j.properties
   
   2. Stop the impact server, and rename/delete the current
   impactserver.log.
   
   /opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/log/impactserver.log
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * ALL IMPACT USERS                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The installer will stop/start the servers during the         *
   * install. To verify                                           *
   * whether the server started successfully, it'll scan          *
   * impactserver.log                                             *
   * for a specific string                                        *
   * ("Impact_instance_started_successfully").                    *
   * However, if the debug level is set too high, the log may     *
   * rollover                                                     *
   * before the log can be scanned. As a result, the installer    *
   * waits for 10                                                 *
   * minutes before timing out with an error.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Being that the issue was mainly with the amount of data being
   logged,
   which prevented the reader from keeping up; the installer will
   ammend
   the logger (preventing debug logging from being enable during
   the
   install).
