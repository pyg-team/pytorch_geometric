 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in openssl that is embedded in the IBM FSM. This bulletin addresses these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505] for the current score
