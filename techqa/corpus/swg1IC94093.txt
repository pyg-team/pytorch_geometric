APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a backend SFTP server is unreachable, the SFTP log target
   will continuously allocate memory while attempting to upload its
    log file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are Datapower configurations using SFTP log targets.
   
   If the SFTP backend server stops responding, the appliance will
   manifest unbounded growth in used memory.
   
   
   
    The fix allows only a
   single pending upload transaction per log target.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 6.0.0.1.
