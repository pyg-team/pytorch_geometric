ANSWER
The message "Click to activate and use this control" or "Press SPACEBAR or ENTER to activate and use this control" appears when the Java Connect or Meeting Room Client applets are first loaded, requiring an extra end user keystoke before being able to interact with them. Note that joining a web conference that does not have a password will show the message, but does not require any keystroke to simply view a presentation.

The login dialog of Java Connect opens as usual and you can type in the user name and password. Once logged in, the buddy list appears and instant messages can be received. However, the Java Connect main window still needs to be activated, and one of these two messages will be displayed. The first click to a person's entry in the buddy list may just activate the buddy list window, requiring a second click to initiate a chat.

Web pages enabled with Sametime Links Place-based Awareness using the Sametime Links Toolkit are not affected by this Internet Explorer change, and the chat and list windows launched by Sametime Links JavaScript functions do not see these extra messages. 

This issue has been reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# RHUN6NN5RR for Meeting Room Client and SPR# RHUN6NN5WK for Java Connect.

Microsoft plans to include update KB912945 in the April cumulative security update for Internet Explorer. Customers may install it without realizing they have changed the behavior of their applications. Update KB912945 is a non-security update for Windows, and Microsoft will also release an optional Compatibility Patch which will restore previous Internet Explorer behavior until the next cumulative security update in June, 2006. See Microsoft Security Advisory 912945 for the most current schedule details
