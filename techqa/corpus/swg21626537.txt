CAUSE
In order to use Workplace or Workplace XT without SSL or in an SSO/Container Managed configuration with WebSphere Application Server version 8.0.0.x or higher, security settings must be updated. These settings permit non-SSL connections to P8 Content Engine and allow container-managed applications to pass HTTP session information to an applet.



ENVIRONMENT
Workplace XT 1.1.5, WebSphere 8.x
