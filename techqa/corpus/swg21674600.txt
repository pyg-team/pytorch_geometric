PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Enabling the PolicyLogger to output SQL statements produced by Policies

SQL capture or action not occurring as expected


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

And, of course, one would also have to enable:

This will produce a log file in the directory (Impact 5): 

 * 



or (Impact 6): 

 * 
 * s


of the format: 

 * 


Where [ImpactServerName] is the name of the ImpactServer (for example: NCI) and [PolicyName] is the name of the Policy producing this output (for example: My_Enrichment_Policy) and (.n) are the numbered roll-over log files (between 1 and 10 by default).
