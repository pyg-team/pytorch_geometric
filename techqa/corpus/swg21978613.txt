 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Attempts to use silent install for IBM Security AppScan Source on Linux results in error "binding to port failed".


SYMPTOM
When running a silent install on Linux the install fails with the following error: 

 * 
 * [root@localhost appscan]# ./setup.bin -f appcaninstall.config
 * 
 * Preparing to install...
 * 
 * Extracting the JRE from the installer archive...
 * 
 * Unpacking the JRE...
 * 
 * Extracting the installation resources from the installer archive...
 * 
 * C
 * onfiguring the installer for this system's environment...
 * 
 * Launching installer...
 * 
 * ERROR: [Agent.cpp:164] "JDWP error in VM_INIT:TransportException 
   [510/201] binding to port failed (error code: -251) 
 * 


A successful install returns the following message in place of the error (the last two lines in the above message): 
 * Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005


CAUSE
During the install the Java process attempts to open port 5005 (the port number is static and it is the same each time the install is run). If this port is blocked the error will be seen. 

 * The most common cause is that a Java process did not shut down correctly during a previous install. 
 * Other reasons could be that the port is blocked by a firewall or some other application may be using the port.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First check if the port is occupied by an existing Java process, by running the following command: 

 * 
 * ps -ef | grep java


and looking for a Java process running from the temporary directory used by AppScan Source during installation, something as follows: 
 * /tmp/install.dir.22910
 * /Linux/resource/jre/bin/java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=
 * 5005 
 * -Dlax.locales=all -Dlax.locales.all=true -Ddebug -Dlax.debug.level=3 -Dlax.debug.all=true com.zerog.lax.LAX /tmp/install.dir.22910/temp.lax /tmp/env.properties.22910 "-f" appcaninstall.config



If there is a hanging Java process, kill the process as root or the process owner and run setup again. 

If there are no existing Java processes, check the output of the following commands for port 5005 (both of the commands may need to be run as root): 
 * /sbin/iptables -L -v -n 
 * 
 * /bin/netstat -a


If the 5005 port is blocked or used by other application, discuss the issue with your system administrator to resolve it. 

If the port does not show up in any of these outputs, please contact AppScan Technical Support for further assistance.
