ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Many of the Interim fix require profile upgrade and/or database
   upgrade due to change in system applications and system toolkit
   Currently we are using generic profile upgrade
   (BPMProfileUpgrade) and database upgrade tooling (upgrade7x) as
   post IFix install procedure.
   
   These generic tools try to upgrade everything deployed to the
   profile and everything in the database. If Customer environment
   profiles, configuration  and database contain unexpected
   information, the generic upgrade tools are failing on
   the customer machine.
   
   This is causing delay in customer installing the Ifix,   many
   had to roll back since they were not able to wait for the
   root-cuase analysis. Post IFix install failures are
   unrelated to the specific Ifix content.
   
   Some of the customer did not have backup of their profile or
   database to be able to rollback the changes.
   
   This is a enhancement request for development to provide
   customized tooling for each IFix.
   
   Intermin Fix upgrading the "System Applciation"  EAR file :
   
   1.  IntermFixes installation should automatically update the
       specific "system Application" (EAR files) by calling the
       component specific ANT task  after installing the binary.
   2.  Uninstalling the interm fix should be able to use the same
       ant task to restore the old System Application after
       installation Manager rollback of the binary.
   
   Interm Fix upgrading the database for system ToolKik, process
   portal , language pack etc in the Porcess Server database :
   
   1. After IntermFix binary installation we need customized
      tooling for updating the database for only the specific
      change included int he interm Fix.
   2 We also  need customized code  which can restore the specific
     change made by the Interm fix after IM rollback the binary.
     (update the databasae with previous version of the toolKit)
   
   WorkItem RTC# 83837 exist database upgrade tooling for minor
   upgrade.
   
   IF an IFix provide customized post Binary install tooling for
   installing  and rollback of the system applciations,  it will
   eleiminate the requirment
   for customer having to backup complete profiles and database for
   every minor IFix installation.
