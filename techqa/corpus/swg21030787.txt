QUESTION
 Why should I reorganize my DB2 database for my SAP application? 

ANSWER
Some reasons for reorganizing a DB2® database include: 

 * You are correcting free space problems. Empty pages often occurs after a large number of deletes. SAP recommends reorganizing after performing a large number of archives or deletes. 
 * If data in VARCHAR fields is extended, the longer length field does not fit into the same page and a pointer to the new location is placed in the original location. With each of these “overflow” rows, DB2 reads two pages to retrieve the actual data. Reading two pages per record can cause performance problems if tables have a large number of overflow rows. 
 * Indexes on tables with large number of inserts, deletes, or both might have a bad cluster ratio. You should reorganize tables that have a bad cluster ratio. Only one index on a table can have a cluster ratio of 100%.
