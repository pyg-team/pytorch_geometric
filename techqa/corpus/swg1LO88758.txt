ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Domino (r) Server (64 Bit) (Release 8.5.3FP6 for
   Windows/64)
   I'm used to work with Domino for years... I know exactly where
   is the
   field to change to change mail maximum size...
   
   But we are currently experiencing strange issues... Maximum is
   set
   everywhere to 20mb, but messages under this limit are refused.
   
   Let me explain : there are 4 mail servers, sending external
   mails to 2
   mail gateways.
   
   They are using a "special ip", which leads to the first or the
   second
   gateway : it's a kind of load balancing, managed by a network
   tool. For
   example, you can ping it hundred times, it leads to the first
   one or
   the second one => it works fine.
   
   On the mail server I can see "552 Message size exceeds fixed
   maximum
   message size"
   
   but no information on what server did refuse... I just can see :
   
   Router: Message 0031BF25, 0031AE90 delivered to Emmanuel
   
   PIC/DIS/INFODESCA/Descours-Cabaud from Emmanuel
   
   PIC/DIS/INFODESCA/Descours-Cabaud  Size: 15425K Time: 00:00:00
   Hop
   Count: 2
   
   Is there a way for me to do some kind of other send test ?
   
   How can I try to understand better what's wrong ?
   
   There is no information at all on smtp servers that could help.
