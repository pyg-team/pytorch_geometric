QUESTION
 It takes a long time to load a decision table; how do I improve the response time when using a large decision table? 

ANSWER
Disabling the checking (overlapping, contiguousness, symmetry, cell values) performed on the decision table will improve performance when you deal with large tables.
You do so in the decision table properties by unchecking the corresponding checkboxes in the Table checking / Table checks section. 

Once this is done, you will not be performing those checks each time you load the table.

It is always advised to minimize the size of decision tables by breaking them down into smaller tables, when possible, as it also makes it easier to maintain their content.
