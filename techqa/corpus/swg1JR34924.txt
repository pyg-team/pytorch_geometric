LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   WebSphere Commerce V7.0 Arabic customers
   
   PROBLEM ABSTRACT:
   Websphere Commerce Madisons store does not support Arabic
   locale.
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT:
   Madisons store does not support Arabic language.
   
   RECOMMENDATION:
   Apply the Interim Fix supplied with this APAR.
   
   Also, because this new language is temporarily only fully
   supported in the Madisons store. You need to execute the
   following SQL as a manual step. This will setup a global
   language fallback for the Arabic language where the English
   message will get displayed if a translation is not available in
   Arabic locale files.
   insert into langpair (storeent_id, language_id, language_id_alt,
   sequence) values (-1, -23, -1, 100);
   
   If using WebSphere Commerce Developer, you will also need to run
   the following:
   1) Make sure the server is stopped.
   2) Open a command line window and navigate to the
   <WC_InstallDir>\bin directory.
   3) Execute:
   massload
   <WC_InstallDir>\schema\xml\wcs.bootstrap_multi_ar_EG.xml
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this Interim Fix, the Arabic languages is has been added to
   the Madisons store in WebSphere Commerce. All the globalization
   aspects (example: address, currency, date formats) in regards to
   the Arabic language have now been added to the Madisons store.
   In addition, many layout problems were also fixed across all the
   pages of the store.
