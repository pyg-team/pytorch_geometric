ABSTRACT
 Collecting troubleshooting data for general issues with IBM WebSphere Portal expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. 

CONTENT
If you have already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21672901]. 

Collecting and submitting logs and configuration data 

1. Reproduce the problem. Collect screenshots, userId, and timestamp information as appropriate. 

2. Run the following script from <wp_profile>/PortalServer/bin to collect the data: 

 Windows: wpcollector.bat 

 Linux/Unix/i: wpcollector.sh

Note: If you wish to use wpcollector to FTP the files to IBM Support, include the -Dpmr=<pmr_number> parameter to indicate the relevant PMR #. For example: wpcollector.bat -Dpmr=11111,222,333 

3. If you did not FTP your files via wpcollector, locate the "wp.mustgather.zip" file or the "<pmr #>-wp.mustgather-timestamp.zip" file in <wp_profile_root> [https://idoc2.swg.usma.ibm.com/portal/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v70/reference/wpsdirstr.html#wpsdirstr__wp_profile_root]/filesForAutoPD/. Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]. 

Note: When sending in logs for review, include any relevant screenshots, timestamps, userIds, etc. in order to expedite analysis of the issue.
