Title: IBM "The java class is not found: org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher" error when running Ant tasks (ODM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There are a number of ANT tasks provided by ODM to perform administrative tasks concerning Rule Execution Server and Decision Center (such as deploying ruleApps to Rule Execution Server). When running the Ant tasks, we see the following error:
The java class is not found: org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the environment variable JAVA_HOME is correctly set and points to the JDK that is bundled with the ODM installation. 

 * Ensure that the environment variable ANT_HOME is correctly set and points to Ant bundled with the ODM installation (<ODM_Installation_Dir>/shared/tools/ant ) 
 * Ensure that ANT_HOME/bin has been added to the PATH variable 
 * If the above do not help, add ANT_HOME/lib/ant-launcher.jar to the classpath.
