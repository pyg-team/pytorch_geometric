Title: IBM Two dispatchers showing in the TCR configuration panel - United States

Text:
TCR duplicate dispatcher registered ITM register two TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Two dispatchers result to be registered on Cognos Content Store and this might cause possible problems or misunderstandings. 

SYMPTOM
Two dispatchers result to be registered on: Reporting => Common reporting => Launch => Administration => Configuration => Dispatchers and Services panel. 

The first one is identified with the hostname, the second one with the fully qualified name (hostname + domain), ie:
http://servername:16310/tarf 
http://servername.domain.com:16310/tarf 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The behavior shows up after that TCR has been reconfigured using the Cognos Configuration tool. Specifically, it occurs when the Gateway URI gets changed from a value containing only the hostname to a value including hostname + domain. 

Although both the dispatchers are actually registered, only the second one (the most recent) is used, so that the old dispatcher can be safely unregistered.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Identify the active dispatcher from the cogserver.log file by opening the file and searching for the string: 

 "DPR-DPR-1002 Successfully registered the dispatcher" 

You will find multiple instances of this message, one for each dispatcher. 

The active dispatcher is the one associated with the most recent "DPR-DPR-1002" message. So we can unregister the dispatcher mentioned by older instances of the "DPR-DPR-1002" message. 

 

2) Unregister the unwanted dispatcher: 

a) open the TCR GUI 

b) navigate through Common reporting => Launch => Administration => Configuration => Dispatchers and Services panel 

c) select the unwanted dispatcher, click on the "More" icon then on "Unregister".
