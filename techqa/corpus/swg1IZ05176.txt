APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ 6.0.2.1 and later ships a JCA Resource Adapter
   on all platforms except z/OS for use with J2EE 1.4 application
   servers.  This resource adapter is documented in Appendix F of
   the WebSphere MQ "Using Java" manual.  This manual describes
   how to install the resource adapter and how to test it using a
   Installation Verification Test (IVT) program shipped with MQ
   called wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear.  Unfortunately, the wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear
   file was only included in the fix pack for Windows.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *    This APAR will ensure the wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear file is shipped on
   all platforms except z/OS in future WebSphere MQ maintenance.
   Until then, the file can be copied from a Windows system and it
   should also be available for download through this APAR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem affects customers who want to use the JCA Resource
   Adapter shipped with WMQ Version 6.0.2.1 and later on platforms
   other than Windows.
   
   Platforms affected:
   iSeries,All Unix
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The scripts used to package up the files needed for WMQ Version
   6.0.2.1 for Unix platforms and iSeries did not pick up the JCA
   IVT program.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The packaging scripts have been changed to include the WMQ JCA
   IVT program wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear.
