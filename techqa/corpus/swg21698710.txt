 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I add FileNet Content Platform Engine user-defined Property Definitions to the P8 Audit Log 

CAUSE
With versions of CPE 5.0 and higher, it is possible to extend user-defined properties to the P8 Audit log database table. When an auditable event occurs, the audit table will be populated according to the AuditAs settings.

ANSWER
The steps of associating a new property to a Document Class are as follows 

 1.  Create a new Property Template
     
     
 2.  Associate the Property Template to a Document Class
     
     
 3.  Modify the newly created Property Definition to use "AuditAs" to identify properties to monitor
     
     
 4.  Enable Auditing on the Document Class
     
     
 5.  Enable Object Change Event to hold user-defined properties 
     
     
 6.  Query the "EVENT" database table to examine the audit results of the new column
     
     
 7.  Create a new Property Template named "Audit_Property_test"  *  Using ACCE select the respective Object Store Open the Data Design folder Property Templates New Display name "Audit_Property_Test" Next Data Type = string Next Finish 
     
     
 8.  Associate the Property Template to a Document Class  *  Using ACCE, select Data Design Classes Document Select the Property Definitions TabAdd button Scroll through to find and select "Audit_Property_Test" 
     
     
 9.  Modify the newly created Property Definition to use "AuditAs" to identify properties to monitor
     
     
 10. Enable Auditing on the Document Class
     
     
 11. Enable Object Change Event to hold user-defined properties 
     
     
 12. Query the "EVENT" database table to examine the audit results of the new column  * 
      * 
      * Open the Data Design folder > Property Templates > New > Display name > "Audit_Property_Test" > Next > Data Type = string > Next > Finish
     
     

For example: Assuming that the Property Template "Audit_Property" is associated with "Document Class" where auditing is enabled for the "Creation" event



 * Via ACCE, open the respective Object Store where the audit log is to be customized 
 * Select Other Classes 
 *  Event 
 * Object Change Event 
 * Creation Event 
 * Add 
 *  "Audit_Property" 
 * Add "Audit_Property" into additional events as required
