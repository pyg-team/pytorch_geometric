APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running BTS and it appears there is a problem with the
   repository file. This generates messages DFHSH0105 and also
   DFHSH0107. Then you get repeated ABENDAHS2  coming out of
   DFHSHRQ in the shrq_method_accept routine. The messages are
   generated continuously several times per second. This will
   eventually fill the system spool and cause other severe issues.
   additional symptoms: KIXREVSCB

   When a BTS activity is unflattened from the repository, DFHBAXM
   bind processing detects that it had been marked active when
   hardened to the dataset. This is invalid, so a disaster response
   is returned and the transaction is abended ASH2. As part of
   commit backwards processing, a new CSHA task is attached to
   harden data back to the repository. However, this fails in bind
   processing for the smme reason, and the process is repeated.
   DFHAC2236 messages are issued for every task that abends like
   this, and these can start to affect spool usage.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The BA domain has been modified to generate first failure data
   capture if an activity is still marked as active when it is
   about to be flattened to, or has been unflattened from, the
   repository data set.
     The SH domain has been modified to set the request state to
   free in the event of a disaster being returned from baxm_bind
   processing. This will discard the request rather than reject
   it with the abend that results in the loop.
     The CICS Transaction Server V5.1 Trace Entries manual
   (SC34-2873-00) will be updated as follows:
     New trace entry BA 0127 will be added after existing entry
   BA 0126 on page 470:
   "BA 0127  DFHBAXM Exc  Activity mode active on repository"
     New trace entry BA 0176 will be added after existing entry
   BA 0175 on page 471:
   "BA 0176  DFHBAXM Exc  Bind disaster    1 BAXM parameter list"
