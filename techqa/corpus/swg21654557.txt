CAUSE
The addP8UsersGroups.bat file was missing the entry call net localgroup DB2ADMNS /add, causing the DB2ADMNS group not to be added. The dependent call net localgroup DB2ADMNS gcddbuser osdbuser f_sw f_maint P8Admin /add also failed. This caused the configPE.bat to fail and the FileNet Process Engine was not correctly configured and the remaining scripts were not ran.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Prior to running the install edit the addP8UsersGroups.bat file in the cpit\install-scripts directory and add the following line in the call net localgroup /add section of the file. 


 *  call net localgroup DB2ADMNS /add
