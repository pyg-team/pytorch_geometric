ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity:   2
   Approver:   Wang Guo Qing
   Compid:     5724B97SO
   Release:    6.2
   Abstract:   ITM warehouse data not correct
   Environment: mySAP agent 6.2 iF0008 ITM 6.2.2
   .
   Problem Description: In R3_Service_Response_Time_H/_D/etc table
   Avg Resp Time is calculated from R3_Service_Response_Time table
   into R3_Service_Response_Time_H table.  But the average
   AVG_Resp_Time is not calculated using Weighted Mean (ITM use
   average without weight instead). This causes the KPI in _H table
   is meaningless. The same issue for other summary table.
   .
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Start historical collection for R/3_Reponse_Time attribute
   group and configure Summarization and Pruning setting for this
   attribute group.
   2. After agent running one day, check R3_Service_Response_Time_H
   and R3_Service_Response_Time_D table, you will find average
   AVG_Resp_Time is not calculated using Weighted Mean
   (Dialog/Steps).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually modify the application support files to use the
   WHSC parameter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In R3_Service_Response_Time_H/_D/etc table
   Avg Resp Time is calculated from R3_Service_Response_Time table
   into R3_Service_Response_Time_H table.  But the average
   AVG_Resp_Time is not calculated using Weighted Mean (ITM use
   average without weight instead). This causes the KPI in _H table
   is meaningless. The same issue for other summary table.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Add WHSC option to let warehouse summarization and pruning agent
   to caculate with weight mean. Below is an example.
   
   We plan to deliver this fix in 6.2 IF0012 at the end of January
   2011.
