Title: IBM Unable to launch SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed SPSS for Windows and licensed the product without any issues. However when I try to launch SPSS either by the shortcut in the "Start" menu or double clicking on "spss.exe" on installed directory, SPSS does not launch. I receive one of the following result or errors:


No Error message. Nothing happens. SPSS startup window will not display on my desktop screen. 

or

Error: "Unable to connect to a remote server."

or

Error: "Failed to create the Java VM" 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The CnsMin.dll of JWORD (an internet search utility for Japanese) appears to be conflicting with SPSS and preventing it from starting.

Disabling the JWORD service on your OS via the system configuration manager (msconfig) or completely uninstalling JWORD will resolve the conflict and allow SPSS to startup normally.

Procedures to disable the service via the system configuration manager (msconfig):

1. Go to Start->Run and type "msconfig".
2. Click on the "Services" tab.
3. Uncheck "JWord" and click OK.
4. Reboot the machine normally and startup SPSS for Windows.

Please use "Add & Remove Programs" in Windows to uninstall JWord:
1. Go to Start->Control Panel->Add & Remove Programs
2. Scroll down and find the program "JWord" and click on the "Remove"
3. Follow the uninstall procedures provided
