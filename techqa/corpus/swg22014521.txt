ABSTRACT
 Details of WebSphere Application Server and associated Java version support announcements. These support changes are being made by the WebSphere Application Server team and not the Cúram Social Program Management team.

CONTENT
There have been some support announcements made regarding WebSphere Application Server (WAS) and associated Java version support, the details of which are outlined below. This technote is being published by the IBM Cúram Social Program Management team to remind it's customers of these WAS and Java version support changes. Customers should already be aware of these changes, as they would have been communicated by the WAS team as part of their announcement process.
The IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) prerequisites for each version of the product should be consulted for details of the current WAS and associated Java version support.


 * The End of Support (EOS) date for both WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0 is April 30, 2018. 

 * This event is driven by the EOS of the embedded IBM Java SDK 6.0 (https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/support/lifecycle/ [https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/support/lifecycle/] ), therefore full extended support is not an option. 
 * Support for the WebSphere Application Server code is available for customers who have purchased extended support.  * For the SDK, support is limited only to usage and known defects for customers who have purchased extended support. 
    * No new APARs will be accepted against the SDK. 
    * Between May 1 and December 31, 2018, interim fixes might be provided which include Critical Patch Updates for Java 6.0 from Oracle, but such fixes do NOT imply full support. 
    * No more fixes will be provided for the IBM Java SDK after December 31, 2018.
   
   
 * Support for using IBM Java SDK 6.0 with WAS 8.5.5.x also reaches EOS after April 30, 2018.  * Customers must upgrade to a higher version of the SDK to receive support. 
    * Fix pack 8.5.5.13 is the last fixpack that supports using IBM Java SDK 6.0. 
    * Fix pack 8.5.5.14 and later will automatically install IBM SDK 8.0 and remove IBM Java SDK 6.0 if it is detected.
   
   
 * Additionally, support for using IBM Java SDK 7.x with WAS 8.5.5.x will be EOS after September 30, 2019.
