QUESTION
 What is the procedure to apply Websphere Application Server iFixes to a Tivoli Integrated Portal installation on a Windows platform? 

ANSWER
Warning: The following procedure applies only to Websphere Application Server "iFixes". Do not apply Websphere Application Server "fix packs" directly to a TIP installation. WAS fix packs must be bundled in a Tivoli Integrated Portal fix pack to ensure all TIP and administrative console functionality is still intact and to keep TIP in a supported configuration. 

To apply a Websphere Application Server (WAS) iFix, do the following:

To apply the fix: 


 1. Copy the iFix (.pak) file directly to the WAS Update Installer maintenance directory: 
    
    <TIP HOME>\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\maintenance 
    
    
 2. Stop TIP
    
    
 3. Launch the WAS Update Installer 
    
    $ <TIP HOME>\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\update.bat
    
    a) On the Welcome screen, click next;
    
    b) On the Product selection panel enter the literal path for <TIP HOME> for the Directory path, and then click next.
    
    c) On the Maintenance Operation selection panel select "install maintenance package", and then next.
    
    d) On the Maintenance Package selection panel enter "<TIP HOME>\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\maintenance" and then next. 
    
    e) On the Available Maintenance Packages to Install panel select 
    target .pak file, and then next. 
    
    f) Click next for the next two screens to proceed with the install. 
    
    If the package is installed, you should get a "Success" confirmation.
    
    
 4. Start TIP
    
    

To uninstall Websphere iFixes: 
 1. Stop TIP
    
    
 2. Launch the WAS Update Installer, and select the package to be uninstalled. Complete the uninstall.
    
    
 3. Restart TIP
