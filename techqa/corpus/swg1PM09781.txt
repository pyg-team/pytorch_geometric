   This APAR fixes several problems, one of the major fix is the
   ability to support different versions of client code. And, the
   detection of a flag to enable or disable FMI from running on
   a host. The rest of the issues are described in the
   problem description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  FMI is now able to run with different versions of the client.
