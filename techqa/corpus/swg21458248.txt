ABSTRACT
 ITCAM for Application Diagnostics version 7.1.0.2 provides new support for WXS, however is necessary to perform the security configuration manually, by completing the steps in the attached document. 

CONTENT
Before performing the steps in this document, install ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications and configure it to communicate with the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS).
After completing the steps in this document, use the Zone Configuration workspace to configure the Agent to connect to the WXS catalog service. During this configuration, you do not need to set security parameters, as they are not used.

If, after completing zone configuration, the connection to any catalog services does not work (the ERROR status is displayed), restart ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications.

When you install a fix pack or interim fix for ITCAM Agent for
WebSphere Applications, the changes made in the yn.ini and kynwb.properties
files are overwritten. Therefore, after installing a fix pack or interim fix, you must
complete the changes in this document again. For more information, see the
technote at: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21575378 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21575378]

If any additional details for your platform are required or you encounter any other difficulties in the security configuration procedure, contact IBM Support.
