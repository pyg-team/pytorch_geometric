Title: IBM SSL connection failure due to invalid Certificate Revocation List (CRL) - United States

Text:
Revocation check CRL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WPG fails the SSL handshake with the recipient server when the CRL check is enabled but the certpath validation fails due to one of the following reasons:
1 - Failure to access the CRL locally, in <WPG_install_path>bcgexpress\config\security\crl
2 - Failure to access the CRL remotely, via the URL specified in the certificate
3 - Success to access the URL but failure to find the referenced CRL in the specific distribution point 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem can be addressed in one of the following ways: 

1 - Locally: Making the CRL available in <WPG_install_path>bcgexpress\config\security\crl
2 - Remotely: Enabling the CRL Distribution Points running the bcgSetCRLDP.jacl script, as documented in the WPG Express User guide, chapter 5 - Configuring Security, section "Working with certification revocation lists" 

If the above do not resolve the error, then disable the revocation check by setting the property: "bcg.checkRevocationStatus=false"
in the <WPG_Install_path>\bcgexpress\config\bcg.properties file
