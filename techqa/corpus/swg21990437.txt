QUESTION
 What is the difference between SHA256 and SHA-256? 

CAUSE
While there is no difference in the hashing algorithm some software has implement logic checking for a dash. The original specification ( https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130.txt [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130.txt] ) showed the values that should be used in the AS2 headers:
The currently supported values for MIC algorithm <micalg> values are:

Algorithm Value Used
--------- -----------------
SHA-1 sha1
MD5 md5


As a result the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator software used values without the dash. It continued this methodology with SHA-2. This resulted in an issue http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21972763 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21972763] with the signing algorithm.


ANSWER
There is no technical difference between the SHA256 and SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
