PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   ENOVIA.
   .
   Explanation:
   The object impacted by a "remove" is the Publisher
   (in this case the cluster) and not the Published
   Event (the ligne in the window).
   The Publish/Subscribe window synchronise the date
   of the Publisher on the date of the most recent
   published event existing in the window, in order to
   avoid to make disapear Published Event that would
   arrive during the consultation of the window.
   During a refresh or new display of the window,
   published events that have been published before
   the synchronisation date of the Publisher are no
   more displayed.
   That is why all the lines coming from the same
   cluster are suppressed at the same time.
