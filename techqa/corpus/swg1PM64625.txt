ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Rational Developer for System z  (RDz) 8.0.3.2 - When
   reopening a CARMA Endevor Package that user just closed, package
   does not open.
   
   From the RDz client CARMA Repositories view, user opens an
   Endevor package using any of the editors available.  After
   editor window is open, user closes package editor window with or
   without making changes.  When user attempts to re-open this same
   package, the package is not opened.
   
   At the time of the attempted reopen of the package, the
   following exception can be seen in user's client .log file:
   
   !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.resources 4 2 2012-05-11 15:11:42.296
   !MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in:
   'org.eclipse.core.resources'.

   Local Fix:
   This problem has only been seen when the RDz client CARMA
   preference, 'Check for host modifications before replacing the
   member', is selected.
   Work-around: Deselect the 'Check for host modifications before
   replacing the member' option in your RDz client CARMA
   preferences: Window -? Preferences -? Team -? CARMA
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED: CARMA end users who enable the following CARMA
   prefence:
   "Check for host modifications before replacing the member"
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If the "Check for host modifications before replacing the
   member" is enabled, CARMA will perform a compare between what
   is currenlty on the host with what is currently cached on the
   client.
   The compare is done with a progress moniter service so the
   action can be cancelled if it is long running.
   This compare needed to run on the UI thread and
   it was not; therefore, an exception was being thrown
   and the file was not opened.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ***************************************************************
   Problem Resolution:
   The code was modified to force the compare to run on the UI
   thread.
   
   ****************************************************************
    Additional Keywords:
   invalid thread access
