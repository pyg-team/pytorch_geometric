ABSTRACT
 Interim fix PO04526 provides several fixes for IBM Intelligent Operations Center that relate to both user interface functionality and underlying component functionality. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Interim fix PO04526 is superseded by interim fix PO04782 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039858].




Interim fix PO04526 resolves the following issues:

1. Some updates to data items are not mapped to alerts correctly.

2. For a new data source, updated data items from the data source are not displayed correctly on the timeline. The problem occurs if initially there are no data items to display and then, after the map is repositioned, data items should be displayed. In this case, the updated data items are not displayed on the timeline.

3. Configure a data source that imports data from a CSV file. Route the data to IBM Intelligent Operations Center based on the value of a particular key property, and configure another key property to be used as an ID. The second time that you attempt to import a CSV file, anSqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException exception might occur and the CSV file might not be processed.

4. In the Filter window, select a data source that returns more data items than the limit that is configured in the StatMaxAllowedFeaturesInResponse system property. A warning message is displayed that indicates that the selected filter criteria would return more data items than the configured limit. If you clear the data source selection in the filter panel, the message is still displayed even though it is no longer valid. You must refresh the browser to make the message disappear.

5. When a data source is created, wpsadmin is automatically added as a read/write user of the data source.

6. Data source polling errors occur, and error messages are displayed that are similar to the following example:


 * 00000041 DataReceiverL I com.ibm.ioc.datareceiver.utils.DataReceiverUtil getMaxTimeStampFromSource com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Invalid object name 'dbo.V_KIVA_BDLG_PERMIT_DETAIL'.


7. If you delete a data source and then attempt to recreate it, it is not possible to assign a name to the data source. In the user interface, a long alphanumeric string is displayed as the data source's name. 

8. If you create Esri XYZ map layers through the solution administration interface, an error can occur if a password is not defined. 

9. In both Firefox and Chrome browsers, an error causes filter pane names not to be displayed correctly in the filter configuration tool in the Solution Administration view. Also, in some cases, data sources are not displayed correctly in either the filter configuration tool, or in the Filter window in the Operations view. 

10. If you resize the columns of a chart on the List tab, and then close and reopen the chart, only the last column in the chart is visible. 

11. If the preferred language setting is not configured in a user's user profile, when the user attempts to log on, an HTTP 404 error is displayed that indicates that no content is available. 

12. If more than approximately three Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages are received per second, the messages are not processed correctly. Only the first two or three messages are processed correctly. In the Message Endpoint log file in the WebSphere Application Server console, errors that are similar to the following example are displayed:
