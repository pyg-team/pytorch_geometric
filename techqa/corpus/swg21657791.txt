PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM Business Process Manager V8.5, you can run the BPMConfig command with a properties file to create the deployment environment. When you run BPMConfig command, you might encounter the CWMCB0239E and CWMCB0240E errors. 

SYMPTOM
You might see the following ConfigException in BPMConfig log file: 

com.ibm.bpm.config.util.ConfigException: Found 2 validation error(s): CWMCB0239E: Database schema value db2admin for Process Server should be the same as database user name bpmAdmin.CWMCB0240E: Database schema value db2admin for Performance Data Warehouse should be same as database user name bpmAdmin.


CAUSE
In IBM Business Process Manager V8.5, you can customize the schema name for the Process Server database (BPMDB) and Performance Data Warehouse database (PDWDB) in BPMConfig properties file. However, the database schema name value and the database user name should be same for Process Server database and Performance Data Warehouse database.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to modify the BPMConfig properties file to have the database schema name value and the database user name for Process Server database and Performance Data Warehouse database be the same.
