APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you insert the value 0 into a serial column, the next
   available value will be inserted. When that value reaches the
   maximum value 2147483647 the internal variable tracking the
   serial value will wrap-around to the maximum negative value and
   the advance towards zero. For this range of values a positive
   number will still be inserted into the row.
   
   If you alter your table from a SERIAL to SERIAL8 while this
   internal reference is in this negative range, the sequence
   inserted is wrong.

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Using ALTER TABLE to change a SERIAL column to either        *
   * SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL data type after a wrap around of the    *

   * Doing an ALTER TABLE to change a SERIAL column to either     *
   * SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL data type after a wrap around of the    *
   * serial value happened causes the serial value to restart     *
   * from 1 instead of continuing with a value of MAXINT + 1.     *
