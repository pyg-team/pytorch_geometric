APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a growing number of non-persistent data pages on a
   WebSphere MQ v6 queue manager running on z/OS being
   administered by a v7 Explorer. The longer the Explorer is
   connected to the queue manager, the larger the number of
   non-persistent data pages.
   
   The symptom on z/OS is high usage of the pageset assigned to
   AMQ.MQEXPLORER.* temporary dynamic queue(s). A CHINIT line
   trace shows MQGETs failing with RC=2 RSN=2024
   (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_LIMIT_REACHED).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem affects users of the WebSphere MQ v7 Explorer
   managing a WebSphere MQ v6 queue manager on z/OS
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux (Power),Linux (s390x),Linux (x86),Linux (x86-64),
   Linux (zSeries),Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere MQ Explorer was not issuing an MQCMIT call, as it
   did not expect the queue manager it was connected to to have
   syncpoints enabled by default. The WebSphere MQ Explorer should
   be setting MQGMO_NO_SYNCPOINT if it is not going to issue
   MQCMITs as the z/OS default is MQGMO_SYNCPOINT for destructive
   MQGETs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Any MQGET calls from the Explorer not to be followed by a MQCMIT
   now specify MQGMO_NO_SYNCPOINT. Messages are retrieved correctly
   and there is no build up of syncpoints and data pages.
