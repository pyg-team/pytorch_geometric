ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABSTRACT:
   Clash result is not imported correctly Using a Macro to
   Import Clash Results Saved in XML Format
   SCENARIO:
   1. Start CATIA.
   2. Open the CATProduct.
   3. Go to 'DMU Space Analysis' workbench.
   4. Run 'Clash' command.
   5. Select 'Apply' and then 'Export As'.
   6. Select OK when the export process has finished. Now, the
   interference node is added on the Application node. And the
   XML format report is created as well in the chosen location.
   As can be seen, the interference result has information of
   the clash dimension.
   (Now remove clash result from Product and Import/Read clash
   result into Product)
   7. Remove Interference.1 from the tree. Now the clash result
   has been deleted.
   8. Close the product and save.
   9. Reopen the the CATProduct.
   10. Open SpaceAnalysis.CATScript and modify the script for
   the correct pathname (Script is used to create a Macro to
   Import Clash Results Saved in XML Format).
   11. After correcting the path of filename, run the script.
   RESULT:
   Now, the product has Interference Results.1 added into
   Application node. But it doesn't have the clash result
   dimension detail.
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   Clash result should be imported correctly Using a Macro.

   DELIVERED WITH CATIA VERSION V5R21GA
   NOTE THAT DOCUMENTATION WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED IN  V5R20 SP4.
   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   Clash result is not imported correctly Using a Macro to
   Import Clash Results Saved in XML Format
   Documentation Modification:
   New updation will be available in the following path
   DMU Space Analysis > User Tasks > Using a Macro to Import
   Clash Results Saved in XML Format
   It has been updated as
   If the Federated XML Output option is selected in DMU
   Clash-Process setting page, the xml file to be imported is
   the temlFile.xml generated in the CATTemp folder in the
   directory where the clash result is exported.
   If the Federated XML Output option is cleared, the xml file
   to be imported is the one generated in the directory where
   the clash report is exported.
