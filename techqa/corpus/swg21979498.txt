VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-0705 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-0798 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0798] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in SRP servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted username value to cause a denial of service. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111141 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111141] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0797] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to cause a denial of service. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0799 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory error in the BIO_*printf() functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to trigger an out-of-bounds read. 


CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0702 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover RSA keys. 


CVSS Base Score: 2.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0703 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0703] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to enforce that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers by the SSLv2 's2_srvr.c code. When clear-key bytes displace encrypted-key bytes, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct a divide-and-conquer key recovery attack. 


CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0704 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0704] 


DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. The s2_srvr.c code overwrites the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Bleichenbacher oracle to decrypt sessions. 


CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146] for the current score
