APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using more than one messageset in a flow it is possible for
   the XMLNSC parser associated with one messageset to be reused
   without the messageset reference being cleared out from the
   underlying parser. This can result in inappropriate validation
   or parsing exceptions such as BIP5025E:
   
   XML schema validation error ''Unexpected root tag. Element
   "ElementName" is not a global element.'' on line '2'
   column '74' when parsing element ''/Root/XMLNSC''.  Internal
   error codes: 5032, 2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Not Applicable
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker version 6.1 or higher
   using the XMLNSC parser.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When an XMLNSC parser is reused the messageset associated with
   the parser should be cleared before it is used in another
   context. An invalid assumption was that the "standard non
   validating" XMLNSC parser could never have a messageset
   associated with it and would therefore never need its messageset
   reset before the parser can be reused. This assumption is
   invalid in the case that the parser is invoked from an ESQL
   parse clause with a messageset.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that a new parser
   is used for non validating parses which will never have a
   messageset associated with it. When validation options specify
   no validation this parser is used instead of the normal one
   which may or may not have a messageset associated with it.
