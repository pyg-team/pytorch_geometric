QUESTION
 The initial Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) preview integration between IBM SmartCloud Control Desk 7.5.1.1 (and later) and IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 7.4.0.2 allows users to view Events from IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus while in SmartCloud Control Desk. The release of Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 7.4.0.3 has made this integration even more powerful in that it now uses the Jazz for Service Management Registry Services to view the data.


ANSWER
If you are using Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 7.4.0.3 or later, and you have configured Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus to register event collection identifier patterns in Jazz for Service Management Registry Services, then the following additional configuration steps are required in SmartCloud Control Desk to integrate with Tivoli/Netcool OMNIbus.
