ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  replicated in MBS 7118 maxdemo
   1. Go to the Assets (Tr) application (Go To > Assets > Assets
   (Tr))
   2. Click on the new record icon.
   3. Create a new asset MAY
   add a continuous meter with an initial reading of 1 mile:
   Meter = ODOM-M
   Meter type = actual
   Rollover = 999999
   Average Calculation Method = ALL
   Change status to OPERATING
   4. Go to the Preventive Maintenance (Tr) application (Go To >
   Preventive Maintenance > Preventive Maintenance (Tr))
   5. Click on the new record icon.
   6. Create a new PM.  Attach the same asset created above
   7. Go to the frequency tab, meter based frequency tab
   click new row, enter ODOM-M in the meter field
   ensure only the Generate WO Based on Meter Reading (Do Not
   Estimate) checkbox is checked
   Set the Meter Based Frequency on the Frequency tab to 5.00
   set the meter reading to 1.00 in the Last Work Order
   Information section, set the meter reading date to yesterday in
   the Last Work Order Information section
    change the PM status to active
   after save, next meter reading becomes  6
   units to go becomes 5
   
   8. go to organizations application, bring up EAGLENA.  Go to
   select action menu, PM option.  select Bedford site. Ensure
   Automatic PM WO generation is selected
   9. Go to the Cron Task Setup application. (Go To > System
   Configuration > Platform Configuration > Cron Task Setup)
   10. Ensure the PMWOGEN Cron Task is turned on.
   11. Go to the Assets (Tr) application (Go To > Assets > Assets
   (Tr))
   12. Search for and select the asset record previously created
   in step number two.
   13. Enter a new meter reading using the Select Action menu
   (Select Action > Meter Readings > Enter Meter Readings)
   14. Go to select action menu, enter meter reading
   Enter a meter reading greater than the frequency criteria on
   the PM e.g. 100
   Do NOT tick Rollover checkbox
   Click on the Meters tab to review the update. The mileage
   should now read 100
   
   Go to PM application, check meter based frequency tab
   
   15. Go to the Work Orders (Tr) application and ensure that the
   PMWOGEN Cron Task has created a new Work Order 1175 (Go To >
   Work Orders > Work Order Tracking (Tr))
   Check the PM , meter based frequency
   Last work order information
   Meter reading = 100.00
   
   16. Go to the Assets (Tr) application (Go To ? Assets ?
   Assets (Tr))
   Search for and select the asset record previously created in
   step number two.
   17. Correct the mileage using the select action menu to a value
   below the previous frequency threshold to trigger the PM e.g.
   2.00 (Select Action ? Meter Readings ? Manage Meter
   Reading History), tab out of the meter reading field, do not
   tick rollover checkbox. Click OK.
   
   18. Go to the Work Order Tracking (Tr) application (Go To ?
   Work Orders ? Work Order Tracking (Tr))
   
   19. Find the work order 1175  previously created by the PMWOGEN
   Cron Task and change the status to canceled. Check PM meter
   based frequency, meter reading
   
   20. When the PMWOGEN Cron Task runs again, another Work Order
   1176  is created even though the PM is no longer due based on
   the frequency criteria on the PM
   
   NOTE:  The Meter Reading field under Last Work Order
   Information changes when a work order is opened by the PMWOGEN
   Cron Task.
   
   If a work order is not open, the New Reading filed under the
   Last Work Order information section is 1 mile and the fields
   under the Next Work Order Projections section are populated.
   
   When the new Work Order is opened, the New Reading filed under
   the Last Work Order information section changes to 2 miles
   which is the current mileage of the asset
   and the fields under the Next Work Order Projections section
   become blank.
   The New Mileage should not change until a new Work Order is
   completed

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a PM meter-based work order is canceled, a new work order
   is no longer erroneously generated when the PM work order
   generation cron task is run.
