APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Policy Reference Manual states:
   The Exit function causes a policy to stop running. You can use
   the Exit function anywhere in a policy where you want to
   terminate processing.
   
   However... after testing the Exit() function we found that it
   doesn't necessarily exit the policy. If you're inside of a
   "function ()" it'll just exit that function, and not the entire
   policy.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This is a documentation change, however if one wants to exit the
   policy from within the function one can do the following:
   
   You can flag it: ie, if you are in a function()
   
   function test(){
     if (exit){
       exitNow=true;
     }
   }
   
   
   and then later in the policy:
   
   if(existNow){
   exit();
   }
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Exit function is not properly documented
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Exit function example in the documentation is not clear to the
   user. The function should be documented with proper example to
   explain the usage and how to exit the policy and user defined
   function.
