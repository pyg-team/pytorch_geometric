APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using RBM authentication method 'user cert' and the
   certificate DN contains non-ASCII characters, those characters
   will be returned incorrectly as escaped characters.
   
   As an example when the output is UTF-8, the two-byte
   character LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (&#65410;) will
   incorrectly appear as eight one-byte characters:
   \xC3\xA9
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The user was observing an issue when logging into the webgui via
    user cert. When logging in if their certificate contained
   special characters, these would be escaped out in the dn which
   is passed to LDAP. This was due to an issue in the RBM mapping
   credentials process.
