PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the IBM Integration Bus (IIB) Toolkit , double-clicking a Compute node in your Message Flow creates a new, duplicate copy of the ESQL COMPUTE MODULE. 

CAUSE
The Toolkit automatically creates a new ESQL COMPUTE MODULE if it detects that one does not already exist for the Compute node. In this case, a duplicate module is created because the first module is not yet associated with the Compute node. The association is made the first time that the ESQL file is built by the Toolkit.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
By default, this "build" is done automatically. However, this is an editable setting. 

You can confirm whether "build automatically" is enabled by checking the Toolkit's 'Project' menu.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To verify that your ESQL COMPUTE MODULE is associated with your Compute node, complete the following steps: 

 1. Save the *.esql file that you want to associate with the Compute node. 
 2. Save the *.msgflow file that contains the Compute node. 
 3. Build the project, by selecting "Build" from the Project Menu. 
 4. Remove any duplicate compute modules from the ESQL file, by opening the ESQL file, and manually removing the duplicate compute modules.


Step 3 can also be completed either by clicking 'Build All' or by checking 'Build Automatically' in the Toolkit's 'Project' menu. The 'Build Automatically' option remains selected, and prevents you from needing to manually build your message flow projects in the future. When you have completed these steps, the associated ESQL COMPUTE MODULE should be highlighted when you double-click your Compute node.
