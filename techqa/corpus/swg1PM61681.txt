   Select a target repository that includes the base offering

   The 1.5.2 IBM Packaging Utility generates a bad message when
   users are trying to create a package of IBM Rational
   Performance Tester product.  A defect in the 1.5.2 IBM
   Packaging Utility was found.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix was made to the 1.5.3 IBM Packaging Utility to add the
   update repositories to the working group instead of closing
   them. This is consistent with how IBM Packaging Utility
   works in general (all open repositories are added to the
   working group, and checking for updates is essentially the
   same as adding the update repositories to the open set).
