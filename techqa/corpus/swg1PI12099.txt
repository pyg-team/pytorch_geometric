APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempting to update a derived states internal transition, using
   the IBM Rational Rhapsody Java API, by changing the base states
   internal transition sometimes results in the derived states
   internal transition not being updated.
   
   
   SYMPTOM
   
   When you modify a base states internal transition using the Java
   API, a state derived from this base state does not have its
   internal transition updated accordingly.
   
   Results:
   
   Sometimes when performing this operation the derived states
   internal transition will not be updated to the value of the base
   states internal transition.
   
   Steps To Reproduce:
   
   1. Create a class with a statechart.
   
   2. Add a state to the statechart.
   
   3. Create a second class that derives from the first class.
   
   4. Open the derived classes inherited statechart and select the
   state.
   
   5. Using the Java API, get the selected state with
   getSelectedElement().
   
   6. Get the static reactions of the selected state with
   getStaticReactions().
   
   7. Iterate to get the internal transition.
   
   8. Get the action of the internal transition, and then set the
   body with setBody() to some string value.
   
   
   WORKAROUND
   
   There is no workaround as at this time.
