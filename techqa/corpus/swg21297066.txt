CAUSE

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent has two type of agent installs for AIX: 

aix513 is the 32 bit version of AIX
aix516 is the 64 bit version of AIX

In this case, the output of cinfo -i was as follows:

ka Monitoring Agent for Tivoli Enterprise Console
aix513 Version: 03.90.00.00

The output of cinfo -i on an AIX 64 bit system should be:

Remove the current installation of the TEC Health Agent and reinstall it with the 64 bit version of the software.
