VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Please consult the security bulletin for Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-4000) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21957980]vulnerability details and information about fixes.
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
