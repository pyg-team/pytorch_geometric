Title: IBM Cognos ICM - Communication error when configuring an import - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to create an import from a DB2 Source, using an ODBC connection to an Oracle model, but when I press Preview in Import Data Wizard - Step 4, I receive an error. 

SYMPTOM
In the Import Data Wizard, I do the following: 

Step 1: I select ODBC Compliant Database 

Step 2: I select Driver: IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER 

Step 3: I define my connection information. 

Step 4: I press Preview 

 

The Error message received is: 

 

'An error occurred reading the data source.' 

 

Error details are: 


ERROR [08001] [IBM][CLI Driver] SQL30081N A communication error has been detected. Communication protocol being used: "TCP/IP". Communication API being used: "SOCKETS". Location where the error was detected: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx". Communication function detecting the error: "connect". Protocol specific error code(s): "10060", "*", "*". SQLSTATE=08001 

ERROR [IM006] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver's SQLSetConnectAttr failed 

Error Type: 
============== 
System.Data.Odbc.OdbcException 



ENVIRONMENT
IBM Cognos ICM Admin Client using Oracle database and importing from DB2 database



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the connection issue, use an ODBC DSN as a middle-step to achieve connectivity.


Create a System DSN on the server that uses the Oracle ODBC driver, then set Cognos ICM connection string manually to use this DSN. To do this, In Import Data Wizard - Step 3, press the "Advanced" button and replace the existing connection string with one that uses the following format: 

dsn=<OracleServerName>;<uid=OracleDatabaseUserName>;pwd=<OracleDatabasePassword>
