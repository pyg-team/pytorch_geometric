APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM MQ queue manager validation check of a certificate  against
   an LDAP CRL server fails with an AMQ9646.
   
    AMQ9646: Channel 'xyz' could not connect to any LDAP CRL
   servers.
   
    EXPLANATION:
    LDAP Certification Revocation List (CRL) servers were specified
   but a connection could not be established to any of them. The
   channel is 'xyz'; in some cases its name cannot be determined
     and so is shown as '????'. The channel did not start.
    ACTION:
    Check that the LDAP CRL server specifications are correct.   If
   they are, check that the servers are running and that the
   networking to access them is working correctly. Fix any errors
    found and restart the channel.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All IBM MQ user  with SSL enabled tries to use the Higher  LDAP
   protocol version.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Some CRL servers require that a specific version of the LDAP
   protocol be used. MQ did not have any provision to ensure that
   its cryptographic libraries used a specific version of the LDAP
   protocol.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new environment variable has been added:
   AMQ_SSL_LDAP_SERVER_VERSION
   
   This variable can be used to ensure that either LDAP v2 or LDAP
   v3 is used by MQ's cryptographic components.
   
   To request that LDAP v2 is used, set
   AMQ_SSL_LDAP_SERVER_VERSION=2 in the environment used to start
   the queue manager or channel.
   
   To request that LDAP v3 is used, set
   AMQ_SSL_LDAP_SERVER_VERSION=3 in the environment used to start
   the queue manager or channel.
   
   Details of whether a specific LDAP version is required for
   connections the CRL server should be obtained from the server
   owner.
   
   This variable does not affect LDAP connections established by
   the MQ queue manager for user authentication or user
   authorization.
