APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "onstat -" shows (see Up 49345 days):
   
   IBM Informix Dynamic Server Version 11.50.TC5     -- On-Line --
   Up 49345 days 06:29:04 -- 78208 Kbytes
   after we change current system date "on-the-fly" back to the
   past (for example, one year back 2010 -> 2009)
   
   IDS must show something like "Up -365 days" or something else,
   but not such huge number of days!
   Or we should include into the IDS documentation some
   restrictions regarding changing system date on machines with
   IDS.

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The 11.50xC6 and earlier versions of the Administrator's     *
   * Reference topic on onstat header information did not include *
   * information stating that "Uptime Unavailable" appears in the *
   * header if the system time is changed to the past on the fly  *
   * and the system startup time is later than the current time.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to IDS 11.50.xC7 and above.                          *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is first fixed in 11.50.xC7. If the engine startup
   time is later than the current time, uptime will be shown as
   unavailable in the banner line in onstat outputs. Here is a
   sample output:
   $ onstat -
   
   IBM Informix Dynamic Server Version 11.50.UC7 -- On-Line --
   Uptime Unavailable -- 144148 Kbytes
   
   The 11.70 Administrator's Reference will include the following
   information in the description of the Uptime field:
   
   If the system time is manually changed to the past and the
   server startup time is later than the current system time, the
   uptime is not available. In this situation, the header displays
   the text
