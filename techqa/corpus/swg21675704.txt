Title: IBM MIB Manager does not start on AIX - United States

Text:
MibManager; nco_mibmanager; AIX; LIBPATH; libswt; libswt-pi-gtk-3738.a TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After execution of $NCHOME/omnibus/bin/nco_mibmanager the command finishes without any further actions 

SYMPTOM
If the MibManager fails to start, a log file is generated in $OMNIHOME/platform/aix5/mibmanager/configuration/

eg log output:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Could not load SWT library. Reasons:
.
/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/platform/aix5/mibmanager/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/118/1/.cp/libswt-pi-gtk-3738.a (No such file ordirectory)
swt-pi-gtk (Not found in java.library.path)
/.swt/lib/aix/ppc/libswt-pi-gtk-3738.a (No such file or directory)
/.swt/lib/aix/ppc/libswt-pi-gtk.a (No such file or directory)


CAUSE
The root cause is usually a missing library or an incomplete LIBPATH

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if there are any missing dependencies/libs that the libswt-pi-gtk-3738.a requires and if the LIBPATH contains all the paths to these libs

eg 
ldd /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/platform/aix5/mibmanager/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/118/1/.cp/libswt-pi-gtk-3738.a

echo $LIBPATH

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check if you have all the required packages installed (see the below link) and lib install paths in the LIBPATH variable
