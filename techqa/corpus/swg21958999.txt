QUESTION
 How often should unit utilization be configured to run? Is there a recommended settings for this configuration? 

ANSWER
Unit Utilization data is only available on Central Manager. Basically, it is a script called crontab that runs every hour by default in each Collector. The Central Manager will collect the data on all machines to populate new GDM_STATISTICS table. 
Utilization Parameters will monitor:


 * Number Of restarts 
 * Sniffer Memory 
 * Percent Mysql Memory 
 * Free Buffer Space 
 * Analyzer Queue 
 * Logger Queue 
 * Mysql Disk Usage 
 * System CPU Load 
 * System Var Disk Usage 


All the parameters above are calculated as the average during a specific hour for a specific unit except of the number of restarts which is a count of the sniffer restarts during a specific hour based on the different PIDs. If you want to monitor the number sniffer restarts (for example, if any unit(s) have more than 3 restarts in any of the two previous 1 hour periods), you can just build an alert to monitor the inspection-core. Ether way, we recommend to configure your unit utilization to restart every hour and "do not repeat". Since this is important to monitor all appliances, choose to run every day. The start time is optional. When the process is invoked, it will summarize the data, on the Enterprise Sniffer Buffer table, starting from the last time it was extracted for each managed unit, until the latest whole hour reported to the Central Manager. If data was never extracted for a specific unit, it will start at the current time- 24 hours. 

For example, if data was never extracted for a specific unit and now is 14:04 on Tuesday and the latest reported record for that unit has a timestamp Tuesday (today) 13:05, then data will be extracted for all whole hours starting yesterday (Monday) at 15:00 (now â€“ 24 hours first whole hour) and the latest period extracted will be the period starting today (Tuesday) at 12:00 (the last whole hour reported is between 12:00 and 13:00, since the last record is from 13:05).
