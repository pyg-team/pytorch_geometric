redhat red hat sklm installing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 gdk_pixbuf_get_width: assertion. Using silent install: CRIMA1002W The following repositories are not connected: 

CAUSE
/opt being less than 12GB (even if installing elsewhere in the GUI) and 
trying to use the 32 bit Installation Manager on a 64 bit server.

ENVIRONMENT
Note that RHEL 6.5 is supported

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Installing sklm 2.5 on RHEL 6.5 fails. Note that RHEL 6.5 is supported:

Install.sh or launchpad.sh gives the gdk error:
(Install:10429): GdkPixbuf-CRITICAL **: gdk_pixbuf_get_width: assertion `GDK_IS_PIXBUF (pixbuf)' failed
(Install:10429): GdkPixbuf-CRITICAL **: gdk_pixbuf_get_height: assertion `GDK_IS_PIXBUF (pixbuf)' failed
(Install:10429): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_window_resize: assertion `width > 0' failed

Trying silent install: ./silent_install.sh
CRIMA1002W WARNING: The following repositories are not connected:
Failed to connect to one or more repositories. The repository might be unavailable for several reasons.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If your environment is 64-bit Operating System, the recommendation is to use 64-bit of IM (Installation Manager). Please download the latest IM version (version 1.8.3) from here:






www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039631#DNLD

Select following package to download:
1.8.3.0-IBMIM-LINUX-X86_64-20150606_0047

Download directly on the machine where the install will be attempted, and unzip locally logged in as root to the box.

Once unzipped, please run one of the following commands from the unzip location to attempt installation of IM itself:
./install - acceptLicense - if installing by the root user, in Admin mode

If you get below: 
Warning:
Installation Manager 1.8.3 (internal version: 1.8.3000.20150606_0047) is already installed at location "/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse" and is using "/var/ibm/InstallationManager" for its data location. Use the installed Installation Manager.

Please try launching the installed IM by itself without using the launchpad or install scripts - the launchpad/script seems to attempt to install another instance of IM (that is a version that is older than
what is installed - IM 1.8.3) and the message is reporting that IM1.8.3 is already installed.

Launch IM 1.8.3 by itself from the directory /opt/IBM/INstallationManager/eclipse, as root user.
Either click on IBM Installation Manager icon from the Application menu, or from a Terminal window:
1. cd /opt/IBM/INstallationManager/eclipse
2. ./IBMIM

Ignore an error message about the 32 bit Installation manager not being a repository.

Now after that, as IM gets launched, you need to go to File -> Preferences..->Repositories

Click on Add Repository button and browse to a directory where disk1 and disk2 have been extracted and select .../disk1/diskTag.inf
Click OK, Apply and OK , then select install and then the panel should appear which shows DB2, WAS and SKLM listed...select and proceed with the general installations steps.

Solution is to use the 64bit Installation Manager ignoring the one that came packaged with SKLM 2.5.
Root causes were:
/opt being less than 12GB (even if installing elsewhere in the GUI) and trying to use the 32 bit Installation Manager on a 64 bit server.
