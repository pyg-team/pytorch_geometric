APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a large PCA model is built, saving the stream creates a
   25MB file. Save appears to have been successful, but on
   reopening the file, an error is displayed and the stream is not
   opened.
   
   Error message is:
   ===============================
   Error reading file
   <stream file name>
   org.jvnet.fastinfoset.FastInfosetException:
   java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base
   name com.sun.xml.fastinfoset.resources.ResourceBundle
   ===============================
   
   It has been observed that when the model built is smaller (using
   less fields), the stream is saved and can be re-opened as
   expected.
   
   This was originally reported against SPSS Modeler 17.0, however
   it can be replicated using 17.1 and 18.0.
   
   Number of fields needed to replicate this issue varies between
   machines. Some examples are:
    - Using 1750 input fields
    - Can be re-opened after saving
   
    - Using 2000 input fields
    - Cannot be opened again after it has been saved
   
   client_tracing log captures the following exception:

   Test machine configuration and settings used to replicate this
   issue:
   * Windows 7 x64
   * 64GB Total RAM
   * Modeler Client Tools > Options > System Options > Max Memory =

   * <Mod_Install>\config\options.cfg
    - memory_usage, 100
    - modeling_memory_limit_percentage, 100
   
   
   Even knowing the model being built is large, if there was a
   problem with saving the model that was built, Modeler should at
   least warn the end-user during the save process. Users would not
   be pleased that their work appears to have saved, but is
   actually unusable for their need.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Lowering the number of input fields used for the model building
   process is a possible workaround, however, it is understood that
   this cannot always be used.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue has been resolved in IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 Fix Pack
   1.
   
   The problem was due to the compression method of the XML during
   the save process. There was an error in the background during
   the save process that prevented the successful completion of the
   stream, for example, there was a resource limit that was
   encountered. An error is now displayed during the save process
   that will alert the end-user of a problem when saving their
   stream.
