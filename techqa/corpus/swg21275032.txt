RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IDM WS 3.2a: How to change the session timeout for OpenClient, <IDMWSX>?
Open Client Session timeout is not terminating by default after 20 mins.
How to change the session timeout for OpenClient, <IDMWSX>? Assume the Open Client virtual directory is <IDMWSX>.
Try the following: 
In the web.config located in c:\program files\filenet\idm\web\FNopenclient, on the webserver 3.2a, there is a line that starts with "Session State Mode"; at the end of this line there is a "timeout = 20" as default. Change this number to 1 , stop and restart the Default website in IIS . Then, hit the //webserver/IDMWSX, log into a IS library, then click the X on the upper right corner to close the browser. Check the sec_tool on the IMS box, after 1 min, it should log the user out.

If above works, change the value to your desired one such as 10.
