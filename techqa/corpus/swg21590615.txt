Title: IBM "Insert unknown counter company found in xdb" inside FAP log, caused by counter companies that are not active in the company structure - United States

Text:
log; Financial application publisher insert unknown countercompany found in xdbtable TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Customer is using the Controller FAP function to publish data to a TM1 data mart.

As part of this process, the customer runs an "initial publish". This publish appears to work OK. The data mart status is 'Running'.

However, the superuser then looks at the FAP log. There are one or more entries similar to: 

14.03.2012 11:41;20;<company_name> ;Initial publish ;10;Insert unknown counter company found in xdb table 

What does this entry mean? 

CAUSE
The message "Insert unknown counter company found in xdb" is informing the user that the FAP process will add a counter company (which currently exists in the xdb tables that you are trying to publish) that is currently not active in the company structure.

ANSWER
This message is purely for information only - it is not an 'error' as such. 

 * In other words, the message is simply telling the user that the system is adding these counter companies (which are not actually active in the company structure).
