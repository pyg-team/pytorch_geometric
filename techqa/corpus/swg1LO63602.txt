ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When blackberry displays an XPage with an editable rich text
   field using the default inputRichText control, CKEditor, the
   screen shows only a small box, holding about one character, in
   contrast to the rich text control displayed by normal browser,
   or by Blackberry on Domino 8.5, which uses old Dojo editor.
   
   To verify that the Blackberry cannot work with CKEditor, had
   customer load CKEditor demo from Blackberry, at
   http://ckeditor.com/demo [http://ckeditor.com/demo]
   This reported: "Your browser is not compatible with CKEditor.
   CKEditor is compatible with Safari 3.0 or higher, it is also
   compatible with Internet Explorer 6.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Firefox
   2.0+."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Only idea for a workaround is to use the old RichText control.
   However, this is not acceptable because the tool bar is too
   large, and we don't provide the user a way to shrink or hide it.
