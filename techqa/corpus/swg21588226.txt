Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing WebSphere Portal 7 Fix Pack 2 you can no longer connect to or log in to the secondary node(s) on your Portal Cell. You may see the following message in the SystemOut.log for these secondary node(s):

0000001c Servlet E com.ibm.wps.engine.Servlet init EJPFD0016E: Initialization of service failed.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.ibm.wps.devicesupport.PortalDeviceClassBootstrapService
at java.lang.Class.forNameImpl(Native Method)
at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:139)
at com.ibm.wps.services.ServiceManager.initInternal(ServiceManager.java:260)
at com.ibm.wps.services.ServiceManager.init(ServiceManager.java:173)
at com.ibm.wps.services.ServiceManager.init(ServiceManager.java:115) 

SYMPTOM
You can no longer directly access the login screen or other web pages on the secondary WebSphere Portal node(s).


CAUSE
A known bug in Fix Pack 2 causes this issue.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The WebSphere Portal installation library completes successfully, but if you try to directly connect to a secondary node (by going to http://<your-server-name>:<port>/wps/portal), you see the following error message:

Error 404: javax.servlet.UnavailableException: Initialization of one or more services failed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A fix is available for WebSphere Portal to resolve this issue. Refer to the following link for information on how to download the fix. Be sure to review the contents of the Readme_PM56244.txt file that is included with the fix, as there are some post installation actions that must be completed on the WebSphere Portal nodes before the nodes will function correctly again. You can use Rational Automation Framework to install the fix, but the post install actions must be performed manually.
