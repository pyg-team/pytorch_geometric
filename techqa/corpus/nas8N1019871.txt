QUESTION
 What are the newly added SQL Reserved Words? 

CAUSE
Each IBM i release may have new words are added to the SQL Reserved Words list.
It's also possible for new words to be added for a Technology Refresh as well.


ANSWER
Note that just because a word is added to the SQL Reserved Words list does not mean it is "reserved" everywhere within a SQL statement. 


An example is V5R4 reserved word ACTIVATE. 
ACTIVATE is only reserved in the row and column access control (RCAC) context.
You can still name a table ACTIVATE, for example.

You should ALWAYS refer to the DB2 for i SQL Reference for each release. 
This TechNote can be used a quick reference for all recent IBM i releases.
