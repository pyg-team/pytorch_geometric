PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After T5 setup, the YN and HT agents does not start on AIX with message:
KCIIN0198E Unable to start agent. 

SYMPTOM
From YN and/or HT logs, you should be able to see message like this - 

(558AA8C1.0018-1:kwjjvm.cpp,509,"KwjJvm::load") Loading JVM 
/opt/IBM/ITM/JRE/aix523/bin/j9vm/libjvm.so 
(558AA8C1.0019-1:kwjjvm.cpp,315,"KwjJvm::start") ERROR[-4]: 
JNI_CreateJavaVM() failed: not enough memory 
(558AA8C1.001A-1:kwjagent.cpp,310,"KwjAgent::start") ERROR: internal 
exception in src/bridge/jni/kwjjvm.cpp at line 316 
(558AA8C1.001B-1:kwjagent.cpp,312,"KwjAgent::start") Agent stopped 


CAUSE
This ITM jre is corrupted: /opt/IBM/ITM/JRE/aix523 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. If you have a working system with the $ITM_HOME/JRE/aix523 directory, you can copy the 'lib' and 'bin' sub-dirs from a working system and overwrite the 'lib' and 'bin' directories. The agents will start after that. 

2. Your second option is to simply reinstall the YN agent again.
