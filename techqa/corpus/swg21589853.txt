QUESTION
 How can I change the font color for an event after it has been acknowledged? 

ANSWER
To set the color of the font for an event that has been acknowledged for all new users:
1. Do one of the following actions:

a) To change the font color for all new users, edit the file:
webgui_home_dir/etc/system/userdefaults.props

b) To change the font color for an existing user, edit the file:
webgui_home_dir/etc/configstore/ncwUserPreferences/username.nova

Replace username with the user ID of the user.

2. Locate the property ael_user_properties_acknowledge_font_color and change its value to the name of the required color.

3. Save the file.

4. If you have changed the userdefaults.props file, restart the server.
If you changed the font color for an existing user, the change takes effect next time they log in.
