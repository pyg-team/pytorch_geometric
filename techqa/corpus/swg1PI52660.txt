ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to enable or configure your JVMServer you receive
   message:
   DFHSJ0216 A call to CELQPIPI code INIT_SUB has failed. (Return
   code - X'00000000'  )
   The return code of x'00000000' is not very helpful for getting
   to root cause of your problem. You find that the root problem
   is the result of incorrect entries in your JVMPROFILE and your
   USSHOME directories
   When the attempt to process the JVM profile fails this is not
   reported immediately.  Instead DFHSJSC continues on and tries
   to validate the contents of USSHOME and also to redirect the
   JVM output.  If the USSHOME validation fails then DFHSJSC
   reports that error and returns. However, it does not set a
   specific response and reason code so they remain set at their
   initial values.  SJIN_RESPONSE is set to indicate that the
   enclave initialization failed.
   On return to DFHSJIN it believes the enclave initialization
   fails so message DFHSJ0216 is issued.  The PIPI return code is
   0 because that is the correct value.  The enclave did
   initialize successfully.
   The problem of delaying reporting the JVM profile error and
   continuing with other processing should be corrected.

   ****************************************************************
   A JVMSERVER is being installed in CICS.  The JVM profile is
   parsed and a problem is detected.  The problem is not reported
   immediately and DFHSJSC continues processing.  DFHSJSC attempts
   to validate that the CICS datasets and zFS directories are at
   the same service level and will also attempt redirect the
   standard i/o streams before finally reporting the JVM profile
   error.
   
   If the validation of the service level fails then message
   DFHSJ0216 is issued indicating a problem creating an LE enclave.
   The return code from LE is included in the message.  The
   enclave was successfully initialised so the return code is 0.
   
   The incorrect message and return code of 0 make it much harder
   to determine what the real error was.
