PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM Business Monitor, there is a known problem that occurs when viewing a chart in the Report Viewer widget using Internet Explorer V10. When you right-click on a chart or on a heading within a chart, some menu options are disabled when they should be active. For example, the Drill Down and Drill Up options might not be available even though they should be. 

SYMPTOM
The problem happens the first time a right-click context menu is accessed. The next time the menu is accessed, the menu options work as expected.


CAUSE
The first time a right-click context menu is accessed, Cognos references document.namespaces, which Internet Explorer V10 does not support. The result is that some of the menu options are not enabled. 

The problem resolves the next time the right-click context menu is accessed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around the problem, open a right-click context menu on a chart or a on a heading in a chart a minimum of two times. 


To resolve the problem, use Internet Explorer V10 Developer Tools to change the Document Mode setting to Internet Explorer 9 standards . After the change is made, the right-click context menus will work as expected in Internet Explorer V10.
