LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of IBM MQ Managed File Transfer who use
   resource monitors.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This problem occurred due to a timing window when an MFT agent
   was shutting down, and starting up a MFT resource monitor (RM)
   at the same time. These two operations were executed under
   separate threads within the agent. The shutdown thread removed
   the object that represented an instance of the RM, while the
   recovery thread tried to start the RM using the removed object.
   This resulted in a  java.lang.NullPointerException, which caused
   the agent to abend.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM MQ Managed File Transfer has been updated so that if an MFT
   agent is shutting down, it will not attempt to start a Resource
   Monitor.
