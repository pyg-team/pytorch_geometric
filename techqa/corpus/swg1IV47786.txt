APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  New metrics added as part of the convergence of the AIX Premium
   agent were not globalized in the TCR data model due to size
   restrictions of the model itself. This APAR corrects that
   behavior to enable these attributes to have localized strings.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Translate the UNIX OS Agent TCR Data Model.
   
   
   The data model which is used in Tivoli Common Reporting to
   design custom reports previously included additional AIX
   attribute metrics which were provided English-only due to size
   constraints in the Data Model.
   
   The size restriction has been resolved and these additional
   metrics have now been localized.
