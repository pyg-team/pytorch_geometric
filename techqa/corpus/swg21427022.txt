Title: IBM Installing JRules on a Windows x64 environment - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to install JRules 7.x on a Windows x64 environment using a 64 bits jvm? 

CAUSE
The out of the box Eclipse that comes with the JRules installer is on 32 bits. Therefore using a 64bits jvm will not allow to start the Rule Studio
The root issue is that Rule Studio relies on Eclipse which is based on the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT). Since SWT uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) it references 32 bit DLL, hence the issue when running with X64 JVM .


ANSWER
The only way to install JRules on a x64 Eclipse is to first download a supported Eclipse and then install the JRules plugins on top of it. 

JRules versions prior to 7.0.2 support Eclipse 3.3 and prior versions. Unfortunately Eclipse does not provide any 64 bits version for Windows platforms, prior to version 3.4. This makes JRules not usable on a 64 bits environment under Windows. 

Since version 7.0.2 Eclipse 3.4 is supported so in order to build a fully x64 environment you need to: 

- download the Eclipse 3.4 x64 for Windows from the following link:

- install the JRules plugins on top of it as explained in this section of the documentation:
WebSphere ILOG JRules V7.0 [file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphereILOGJRules700/doc/html/en-US/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global.html]>Installing [file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphereILOGJRules700/doc/html/en-US/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Installing152.html]>Installing Rule Studio in Eclipse [file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphereILOGJRules700/doc/html/en-US/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Installing157.html] 

Additionally there is a bug affecting JRules 7.1.1.1 installer which prevents the installation of add-ons on top of Rule Studio when installed in a dedicated Eclipse IDE. If this should be the case you may want to upgrade JRules to the latest fixpack, as explained in this technote. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292]
