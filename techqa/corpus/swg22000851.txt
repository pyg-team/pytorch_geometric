Files 

The following files are included in this release: 

 * 7.6.0.2-TIV-SPL-FP0002.zip


Pre-Installation considerations Before you begin, complete the following tasks: 

 * Back up the middleware servers and the administrative workstation. 
 * If you created custom reports, back up your report design source directory. 
 * Prepare the application server for the installation: 
 * If you are using a WebSphere® Application Server, ensure that the application server is started. The installation program connects to the application server by using the login information that you specify. 
 * If you are using an Oracle WebLogic Server, ensure that the MAXIMOSERVER application server is stopped. If the application server is running, stop the server and wait a few minutes before you start the installation program. If the application server is running, the installation process cannot proceed.
