APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempts to use ReporterPlus generation from within Rational
   Rhapsody results in the license feature Reporter not being
   returned after being borrowed from the license server.
   
   REPRODUCING THE ERROR:
   To reproduce the problem with a license server with the Reporter
   feature:
   
   1. Open a Rhapsody project and select Tools -> ReporterPLUS ->
   Report on all model elements.
   
   2. Close the ReporterPLUS Wizard by pressing Cancel.
   
   The Reporter feature is shown as checked out in the license
   server log, but is not checked back in (returned) when the
   ReporterPLUS Wizard is closed.
   
   WORKAROUND:
   You must close Rhapsody for the Reporter feature to be returned
   to the license server.

   ****************************************************************
   Reporter license feature is not returned when running
   ReporterPlus generation from IBM Rational Rhapsody
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Reporter's license is now returned if it runs as dll (in
   blocking mode).
   It means this fix doesn't work under Eclipse and in
   Create/Edit ReporterPLUS template.
