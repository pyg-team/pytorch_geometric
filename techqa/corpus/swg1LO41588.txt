ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Need native support in the Notes Client for Pre-Startup and
   Post-Shutdown custom addons, so that it is possible to execute a
   program/script before Notes Database is accessed and another
   program after Notes Databases are released during/on shutdown.
   Some example of possible notes.ini settings to activate these
   custom addons(s)
   
    PreStartupProgram=Wait "%WinDir%\system32\wscript.exe"
   "%NotesProgram%\PrePostScript.js Startup"
   
    PostShutdownProgram=Wait "%WinDir%\system32\wscript.exe"
   "%NotesProgram%\PrePostScript.js Shutdown"
   
   The UsePreStartupProgram & UsePostShutdownProgram could be set
   to
   1. object : Wait
     Should Notes wait for program/script to terminate before
   continuing normal startup (Values:  Wait / NoWait )
   2. object : "%WinDir%\system32\wscript.exe"
     Program/script to execute at PreStartup or PostShutdown.
   %WinDir% can be a OS or Notes.ini variable.
     If Program/script is in path then this could be just
   "wscript.exe" or what Program/script that should be used.
   3. object : "%NotesProgram%\PrePostScript.js Startup"
     Parameters to the Program/script that should be passes
   
   The LAB Roaming Team has build some example hooks that give most
   of these functions, and during our testing they have worked as
   designed very well.
   But we request these hooks should be built-in functions, so that
   JAVA and C are not needed on the customer end, plus the Shutdown
   hook only works if Standard Notes is launched not if Basic Notes
   is used. Not that we will be using Basic Notes as we known for
   now, but we still do not know if we will be using 'Notes -sa' on
   some few workstation because of 3-part integration or
   resources.
   
   If the Basic Notes was also enhanced with Post-Shutdown addon,
   it would be nice if an extra parameter was passed to the
   program/script, that stated what was happening like:   'Starting
   Standard-Notes'  or 'Shutting-down Basic-Notes'.
   
   These program/script we will/could use for cleanup or pre-setup
   of platform for the Notes Client, and a lot of other things.
    Examples:
    1.Before the Notes Client access the databases, we may want to
   check that local databases are not to old to replicate, because
   of deletion-stub cut-off date. (An old Laptop from the drawer)
   
   
    2. Before the Notes Client access the databases, we check the
   workstation has access to the company LAN/WAN, and that the
   ConfigFile and ID-file is ready for First-Startup
   
    3. Before the Notes Client access the Roaming databases, we may
   want to remove the databases, and set RoamingUpgrade flags in
   Notes.ini, because old databases are from a different Notes
   version and we want to insure that setup gets new versions from
   the Roaming Server.
   
    4. After the Notes Client releases the databases and the
   ID-file, we want to do some File-Syncronization to an other
   location,
   
   The customer would like to use the custom scripts to access the
   files needed before notes gets a lock on them and just after
   notes releases the lock on them.
   
   There are a lot of new good features in 8.5 like the ID-Vault,
   but during the upgrade face it can not be used because of old
   Notes version do not support this new feature, therefore we need
   to solve this an other way (the old way) while we still have old
   version installed. And this we used to do by replacing the
   standard notes.exe with our program/script.
