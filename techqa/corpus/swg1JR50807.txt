APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The performance of the "Copy item to" and "Move item to"
   operations in IBM Process Designer can be very slow. You might
   notice three REST or EJB calls between the Process Designer and
   IBM Process Center for each process application or toolkit
   track. The network latency of the individual calls can add up to
    a large delay.
   
   You experience this delay after you select the "Copy item to" or
   "Move item to" options just before you are shown the additional
   options, such as "Other Process App" or "Other Toolkit".
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
