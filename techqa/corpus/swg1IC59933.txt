PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker on     *
   *                 Windows who have their Windows operating     *
   *                 system installed with a non English native   *
   *                 language and who want to use the Launchpad   *
   *                 to check the Message Broker Toolkit          *
   *                 prerequisite.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When Windows is installed with a non    *
   *                      English native language then the        *
   *                      folder 'Application Data' is translated *
   *                      to the native language. The Message     *
   *                      Broker launchpad always looks for the   *
   *                      Application Data folder and not the     *
   *                      translated version so is unable to      *
   *                      find the Message Broker Toolkit         *
   *                      install details and reports that        *
   *                      the toolkit is not installed even       *
   *                      when it is.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When Windows is installed with a non English native language
   then the folder 'Application Data' is translated to the native
   language. The Message Broker launchpad always looks for the
   Application Data folder and not the translated version so is
   unable to find the Message Broker Toolkit install details and
   reports that the toolkit is not installed even when it is.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Message Broker Launchpad has been modified to retrieve the
   correct translated location for the 'Application Data' folder
   from the registry and will find the version of the
   Message Broker Toolkit that has been installed.
