APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When only component name is passed to getService, and the
   service is located on a remote server, the Service Component
   Architecture SCA code will append the interface name to the
   component name. This may result in a NameNotFoundException.

   This problem is encountered when the following conditions
   occur simultaneously.
   
   1)An application, such as a servlet or JavaServer Page (JSP),
   contains a call to CurrentCompositeContext.getService and is
   deployed to a different server or cluster than the service it
   is attempting to locate.
   
   2)Only the component name is passed to getService.
   
   3)The service name is not equal to the unqualified interface
   name. This pattern occurs more often in components using
   implementation.osgiapp or implementation.spring.
   
   As an example, if the following component is deployed on
   Node01/server1:
   
   <component name="MyFrontEnd">
       <implementation.spring location="META-INF/my-context.xml"/>
       <service name="MyFrontEnd">
           <interface.java interface="test.spring.FrontEnd"/>
           <binding.sca />
       </service>
   </component>
   
   And the following jsp code is deployed on Node02/server2:
   
   CompositeContext compositeContext =
   com.ibm.websphere.sca.context.CurrentCompositeContext.getContext
   ();
   FrontEnd fe =
   (FrontEnd)compositeContext.getService(FrontEnd.class,
   "MyFrontEnd");
   
   When the jsp code is invoked the following error will be seen:
   
   Caused by:
   javax.naming.NameNotFoundException:
   Context: Cell01/nodes/Node02/servers/server2, name:
   cell/persistent/scaServices/MyFrontEnd/FrontEnd: First
   component in name FrontEnd not found. [Root exception
   is org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextPackage.
   NotFound: IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext/Not
   Found:1.0]
   
   Note the error shows the code is looking for <Component
   Name>/<Unqualified Interface Name> rather than <Component Name>.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Feature Pack for SCA was changed to remove the code
   adding the unqualified interface name to the component name,
   hence correcting the issue reported in this APAR.
   
   APAR PM20954 is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
   Level (Fix Pack) 1.0.1.9 of WebSphere Application Server v7
   Feature Pack for Service Component Architecture (SCA) Refresh
   Pack. Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
