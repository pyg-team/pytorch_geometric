Title: IBM Rational Robot Virtual User (VU) testing fails to do correlation checks when responses are larger than 300000 bytes - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 As an example, a response from a server during a IBM® Rational® Robot VU test has a response of 728881 bytes. A message will automatically be added to the script by Robot that looks like:

Script generation is not doing correlation checks on
the following large response (728881 bytes).
Set System Environment variable "RT_SGEN_CORR_LIMIT"
to a value larger than 728881 to check this response for 
possible correlation of data with subsequent requests.
Currently RT_SGEN_CORR_LIMIT is set to 300000.
Note that increasing value MAY cause script creation
to take a very long time (possibly several hours). 

CAUSE
Rational Robot versions of 2003 SR2 and later have a limit of 300000 bytes to do correlation checks automatically.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This can be resolved by adding a Windows system environment variable to increase the size limit for Robot doing correlation checks from 300000 bytes to a size large enough to handle the response:

Variable Value:
RT_SGEN_CORR_LIMIT=Size_in_Bytes

Summary:

For V2003 SR2 and later releases, overrides the default limit (300,000 bytes) for the size of responses that will be considered for data correlation. Earlier releases have no limit on the size of responses that will be examined for data correlation. This variable must be assigned in the Windows environment and Robot must be restarted to be effective. 

Description:

RT_SGEN_CORR_LIMIT specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of responses that should be examined for data correlation. In investigating why script generation for a customer’s session was taking several hours, we determined that the reason was unusually large (> 2,000,000 bytes) responses. Parsing such large responses to look for data correlation invariably takes a long time.

Note that you should set your limit to be a little higher than the size of the response that you are getting. Setting system environment variables can be done in Windows by right clicking on 'My Computer' -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables

You can create a new one called RT_SGEN_CORR_LIMIT and assign the proper size to it. Once added, you will have to restart Robot for this change to take effect.
