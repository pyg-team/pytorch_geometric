COMMENTS
 *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   "IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY" when creating a S-TAB.
   Model corrupted.
   
    CORRECT APPLICATION:
   The message is correct and the model is not corrupted.
   Enter a proper set of values with ELEMENT/MODIFY and the
   message disappears.
   
   Here is the explanation of what happens :
   
   The S-TAB feature is brought from library. It is an external
   detail with a given set of values for XREF parameters, for
   instance THICK=1.5.
   
   The creation panel of the S-TAB shows another set of values
   defined by the end user or part-defined default parameters,
   for instance THICH=2 and RADIUS=2.
   
   After YES:CREATE,the feature is instancied with the external
   detail set of values and then modified with the panel set
   of values.
   
   When the message "VALUE OF PARAMETER OUT OF LIMITS" appears,
   one , or more, parameter violates the internal parametric
   rules of the feature. For instance :
   
      HEIGHT > 2*RADIUS + THICK
   
   This relation is then explain by the long message:
   "HEIGHT TOO SMALL OR RADIUS TOO LARGE".
   In this case the modification of parameters is refused.
   The actual values of the feature are restored in the panel.
   
   The problem with the S-TAB is that this relation should take
   into account the model tolerances with a strict inequality.
   In fact the parametric relations are checked with a large
   inequality and tolerances cannot be taken into account in
   parametric relations without to restrict the
   range of possible values.
   
   In the scenario, the set of values is just at the limit of
   validity domain since HEIGHT = 2*RADIUS + THICK.
   
   That is why the parametric modification occured without
   error message. These values remain displayed in the panel.
   But this set of values does not allow to build the
   corresponding solid. That is why the message
   "IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY" occurs when updating the solid.
   At this stage, no more precise information is available.
   
   I would suggest in this case, when the end user is lost, to
   modify a parameter with a tremendous value. Then the
   parametric limits should be overcome and a more helpful
   message displayed.
   
   Anyway, the message "IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY" does not mean
   the model is corrupted. At any time, it remains possible
   under ELEMENT/MODIFY to give a sensible set of values to the
   feature and evaluate the corresponding branch of solid
   properly.
   
   Enlightenings about specific parameters:
   
   The switches (like "REFERENCE POINT") are just hiding some
   specific parameters.
   
   The THICK parameter has an imposed value by the part
   definition. Whenever the set of values does not repect some
   parametric relations, the proper THICK value cannot be set.
   On every following YES:MODIFY, CATIA will try to set on the
   proper value of THICK until it succeeds. Then only, the
   feature will be correctly visualised, piercing the part
   sheet.
