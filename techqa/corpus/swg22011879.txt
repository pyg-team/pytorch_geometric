 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL and LibcURL libraries used by BigFix. These are addressed in the BigFix Platform 9.5.8 and 9.2.12 releases. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-1000100 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000100]
DESCRIPTION: cURL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a TFTP URL processing error when doing a TFTP transfer. By redirecting a libcurl-using client request to a TFTP URL containing an overly long file name, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to send private memory contents and obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130190 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130190] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-1000254 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254]
DESCRIPTION: libcurl is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a buffer overread in the string parser. By sending a specially-crafted response to a PWD command, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133027 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133027] for the current score
