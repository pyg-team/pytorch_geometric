ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***********IBM DEUTSCHLAND SW TIV*********
   
   ITIM SERVER RELEASE: 4.5.1 on win2k3
   SAP Agent
   Problem Description:
   SAPAGENT, Version 4.5.1009
   Agent Development Kit - Version 4.33
   enRole Resource Management API - Version 4.33
   enRole Encryption Library API - Version 4.23
   
   The recon completes with warnings and they have around 30% of
   their sap
   profiles which do not
   get pulled into itim.  These profiles utilize the old naming
   convention.
   =====================
   From customer:
   we don't get the following single profiles out of the SAP:
   ZF_TEST
   Z:FA_SP
   Z.TEST
   
   It seems so, that all single profiles beginning with ZF_ and Z:
   don't
   work. These are the profiles with the old naming convention.
   
   It seems so that only the single profiles beginning with Z_
   seems to
   work. These are the new profiles with the new naming convention.
   All of the collection profiles seem to work.
   
   We have several hundred profiles and we don't get access to
   about 30
   percent of all profiles.
   ======================
   
   Should there be a problem with using the old naming conventions?
   I do not have a SAP agent not SAP setup to test this, but the
   customer
   did
   provide the transports they are using.
   
   All information in PMR_Attachments\IBM-Deutschland\70394 which
   include
   SAPagent log, transports, and itim log.
   
   Desired Behavior (Be Specific): Customer needs the SAP agent to
   handle the old naming conventions for SAP
   
   
   INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMER
   why are the IDS logfiles are important to you to recreate the
   error ? The customer defined profiles according to the olds SAP
   conventions with two leading characters (ZF_*,  Z:*, Z.*)  did
   not occur in the agents logfile. So it is highly  probable that
   the TIM profile on the SAP side does not collect them. This is
   long before they can occur in the TIM directory server.
   
   In addition to this technical question I would like to ask you,
   why we spend again so much time in collecting information which
   might not be so important to recreate the problem.
   
   We had a very good status at the POC by the customer until this
   problem occured. I would like to ask you to help us to prevent a
   longer disucssion rather then finding a quick solution so that
   the customer will see we are working on it and we are making
   progress.
   We had  a similar situation at the end of last year with another
   customer concerning the SAP agent were we have discussed over
   four weeks about logfile entries rather a working solution.
   
   Please support us with development help to fix this problem very
   soon.
   Thank you very much in advance for your support and
   understanding.
