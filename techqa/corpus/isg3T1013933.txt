RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Where can I find the Daemon log files ?

 DAEMON LOG FILES 
 LSF server daemon log files are stored in the directory specified by LSF_LOGDIR in LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf. 



File Example Load Information Manager (lim) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/lim.log.hosta 
Remote Execution Server (res) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/res.log.hosta 
Master Batch Daemon (mbatchd) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/mbatchd.log.hosta 
Master Scheduler Daemon (mbschd) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/mbschd.log.hosta 
Slave Batch Daemon (sbatchd) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/sbatchd.log.hosta 
Process Information Manager (pim) 
/usr/share/lsf/lsf_62/log/pim.log.hosta 
 WHO OWNS AND WHO SHOULD WRITE TO THIS DIRECTORY 
 




Make sure that the primary LSF administrator owns the LSF log directory (LSF_LOGDIR), and that root can write to this directory. If an LSF server is unable to write to LSF_LOGDIR, then the error logs are created in /tmp.
