   The error can also happen after other operations, for example
   when a process goes to the next activity and creates a task.
   
   The error can also happen on systems without Basic Case
   Management but that use an external IBM FileNet Content Manager
   as repository for the IBM BPM document store.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On a system with the Basic Case Management function enabled or
   with an external FileNet Content Manager as the repository for
   the IBM BPM document store, fine-grained access control is
   applied to local documents and case folders. When the tasks for
   an instance change, for example when a new task is created or
   when a task is reassigned, these updates must be propagated to
   authorize the documents and case folder of the instance. During
   this update, IBM BPM builds a batch with updates for the IBM BPM
   document store. This batch contained the creation of a new
   object as second item, but the first item already used this new
   object.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.03
   that ensures items are inserted in the correct order into the
   batch.
