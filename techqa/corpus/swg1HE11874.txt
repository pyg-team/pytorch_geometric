APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If existing Hold Notice content contains tables defined for
   formatting purposes (table border=0),  the content
   will show all these formatting tables with a black border after
   upgrading to Atlas 6.0.1.4. Changing the table border using the
   editor does not have any effect in the content
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Tables with border set to zero were used in Hold Notices in
   Atlas V5 to achieve the required alignment of text. After Atlas
   is upgraded to V6, these notices show up with 1px table border
   in preview; and when they are sent from V6, notices are also
   received with table borders.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now from FixCentral in 6.0.3.3
