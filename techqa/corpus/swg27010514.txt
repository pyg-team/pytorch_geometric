ABSTRACT
 This document contains system requirements for the WebSphere Broker V6.1 products on HP-UX on Itanium. 

CONTENT
The #1Configuration Manager, User Name Server and Broker#c requirements for HP-UX on Itanium are documented below. 

 
Configuration Manager, User Name Server and Broker Requirements:



Please read first [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010514&amp;aid=1]  * WebSphere Message Broker, WebSphere MQ Integrator, and Integrator Broker product READMEs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] 
 * Where patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. 
 * The Message Broker supports any JMS 1.1 provider. The minimum embedded JRE is Java™ 1.5. Both of these factors need to be considered when selecting a JMS provider whose client will be embedded in Message Broker. 
 * The Rules and Formatter Extension is not supported on this platform. 
 *  [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2239&uid=swg24014302]Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere Message Broker has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere Message Broker Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself. 

Hardware Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010514&amp;aid=1]  * Itanium systems - any hardware that is explicitly compatible and fully capable of running the specified operating system, all the corresponding supporting software shown below, and any associated applications unmodified.

Operating Systems [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010514&amp;aid=1]  * HP-UX 11i V2 (11.23) for Itanium (plus the recommended HP-UX 11.23 patches required for Java 5.0 (Java 1.5)) 
 * HP-UX 11i V3 for Itanium

Databases
(required for the broker component only) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010514&amp;aid=1] Brokers can access Information Integrator data sources, for user data, on WebSphere Information Integrator for Linux, UNIX, and Windows V8.2.
Brokers can access, via JDBC only, Information Integrator data sources for user data on WebSphere Information Integrator Classic Federation (IICF) for z/OS, where the WebSphere IICF client code is provided for the Message Broker platform.
