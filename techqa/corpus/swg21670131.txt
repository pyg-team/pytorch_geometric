Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
Do you need to use any special syntax in the Server Name field of the Database Configuration Wizard (DBCW) when connecting with a Microsoft SQL Server?

ANSWER
Possibly. Here are some scenarios of setting up the Connection Manager with the Microsoft SQL Server. 

 * when setting up IMC with a local default instance with SQL server:
   Server Name in DBCW: <HostName> 
 * when setting up IMC with a local SQL Server, but using a named instance:
   Server Name in DBCW: <HostName>\InstanceName 
 * when setting up IMC with a remote SQL Server using a named instance:
   Server Name in DBCW: <HostName>\InstanceName,Port# **See NOTE below** 
 * when setting up IMC with a remote SQL Server using a default instance:
   Server Name in DBCW: <HostName>


NOTE: Please review the excerpt below from Microsoft article 177440. In relation to IMC, the information below means that usually IMC is located in a DMZ between two firewalls. When configuring to use a remote named instance, a specific port will need to be opened on the firewall, and for IMC's connection requests to get through. The SQL server will need to be configured for its named instance to use a specific port number. Follow the link below to the article for instructions. 

 

Excerpt from Microsoft article 177440 - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177440.aspx [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177440.aspx] 

"...the default instance of the SQL Server Database Engine listens on TCP port 1433. Named instances of the Database Engine and SQL Server Compact are configured for dynamic ports. This means they select an available port when the SQL Server service is started. When you are connecting to a named instance through a firewall, configure the Database Engine to listen on a specific port, so that the appropriate port can be opened in the firewall."
