ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JSF dynamic date pattern doesn't work in the data list.
   Environment
   Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2
   Rational Application Developer 6.0.1.1 iFix001,002,003
   Re-produce steps
   1. import attached el_test.zip from [file] ? [import] ? [project
    exchange]
   2. select test.jsp ? right click ? [Run on Server]
   3. select test2.jsp ? right click ? [Run on Server]
   Result:
   In test.jsp, date format pattern is applied to display date.
   In test2.jsp, date format pattern is NOT applied to display date
   .
   Date format pattern is defined in the test.UserEntity.java.
   Thus this pattern can dynamically change.
   In JSP, this pattern is specified as #[objectName.Value].
   If you use this dynamic pattern in the single outputText compone
   nt, It works (test.jsp).
   But If you use it in the data list, It does not work (test2.jsp)
   .
   Screen shot for test.jsp and test2.jsp are attached . please ref
   er them.
   Expected:
   Date format pattern is applied to both test.jsp, test2.jsp.

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The convert tag attributes are evaluated when the tag is
   first read unlike component tag attributes that are
   evaluated when needed for rendering. Therefore
   "varuserEntities" does not exist when the attribute is
   evaluated.
   I am assuming the date format should be the same for all
   outputText so then using:
       pattern="#{pc_Test.testUserEntity.dateFormat}"
   will work fine in a dataTable.
