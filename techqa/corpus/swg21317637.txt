Text:
RATLC01236596; PK71365; 1317637 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If an IBM® Rational Rose® model has Cyrillic or Arabic characters on the model elements' labels or documentation, these character will appear incorrectly when the model is imported into Rational Software Architect. 

CAUSE
This issue has been identified as a product defect and has been logged under APAR PK71365. 

Note: Other non-Latin characters such as Greek and Hebrew do not have the problem and the problem does not occur with the Rational Software Architect's XDE Model Importer or XMI Importer.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The following steps reproduce the problem: 

 

 1. Go to Start > Control Panel > Regional and Language Options to set the regional settings to set the Regional Options > Standards and formats and Advanced > Language for non-Unicode programs to a language/locale that uses the Cyrillic alphabet, such as Russian, or to a language/locale that uses Arabic, for example Arabic(Egypt) 
 2. Set the keyboard to either of the language/locales from Step 1. 
 3. Open Rose and create a model with labels and documentation that contain either Cyrillic or Arabic characters 
 4. Save the model, close Rose and open Rational Software Architect 
 5. Use the Rose Model Importer to import the Rose model
    Expected Result: The characters do not change during the import
    Actual Result: The characters in the Rational Software Architect model are different from those in the Rose model
    

The following screenshot is taken from a Rose v7.0.0.1 +iFix004 model and contains Cyrillic (Russian) characters both on the diagram and in the Documentation window: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317637&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317637&aid=1] 



The following screenshot shows the Project Explorer and the diagram after the model has been imported into Rational Software Architect: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317637&amp;aid=2] 

and the following screenshot shows the contents of the Documentation window: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317637&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317637&aid=3] 


As you can see, the Cyrillic characters from the original Rose model and the imported model are not the same. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

WORKAROUND:

The workaround is to copy/paste the correct labels and documentation from the original Rational Rose model into the Rational Software Architect model.
