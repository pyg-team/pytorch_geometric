ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running the ALL target search from TRC Server web
   interface the following error occurs:
   TypeError: Unable to get property 'documentElement' of undefined
   or null reference
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround to the problem:
   Once identified the machine causing the problem, this needs to
   be removed from the server to prevent the error to occurr
   To do this, the target software on the machine should be
   uninstalled
   first, and then the target itself will have to be removed from
   
   the database directly. The row containing hwKey = 2 in the
   ASSET.ASSET table
   should be deleted. You can use the MS SQL database management
   studio to
   interact directly with the trcdb database to delete the row.
   Alternatively, if you would prefer not to remove the target, the
   Search
   functionality can be used to find and access machines rather
   than using
   the All Targets report. This does require you to know part of
   the name
   of the target you wish to access, and you must ensure you dont
   use any
   substring of the name of target causing the issue
    otherwise that target will be
   returned and the report will fail to display.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected:
   Platform affected: All (Windows + Linux)
   Version affected: IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control 9.1.0
   Component: Server
   
   Problem Description:
   The XML generator that is used to create the list of targets for
   reports did not correctly escape certain unprintable characters.
   This issue caused the XML that is  formed, to be invalid if the
   data from the target contained any of these characters. The
   browser would then reject this XML when loading the report,
   causing a blank page to be displayed, and an error to be logged
   in the browser's console.
   
   Problem Summary:
   When loading any report containing targets that included certain
   non-printable characters in their printable fields, the server
   would return a blank page rather than the correct result.
   
   This fix is included in IBM BigFix Remote Control version 9.1.2
   from Remote Control site 36 in the IBMBigFix Console.  For more
