PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Outside In (OIT) version 8.4.1 (and 8.5.0) do not yet support
   Apple iWorks files for Mavericks/Yosemite release so there is
   not yet any support for indexing content from files from those
   releases.  We did find however that the binary "garbage"
   characters are exported because the OIT fallbackformat property
   is configured to FI_TEXT (if the character set is not recognized
   default to text).  In 5.2.1 we've already switched the OIT
   fallbackformat property to FI_NONE (if character set not
   recognized do not export).  To resolve the iWorks garbage
   character issue the same change has been made in
   5.2.0.3-P8CPE-IF005 and higher.
   
   The OIT sx.cfg file has been modified for all supported
   platforms setting OIT property "fallbackformat FI_NONE",
   requiring an update to INSO.zip for all platforms.  The 3pt OIT
   version for this change is 8.4.1.p18530453_OIT5203IF3_841.  File
   required is CSSClientConfig.jar.
