APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When updating a portal page on the syndicator and removing a
   portlet entity from the page, the portlet is not removed from
   the subscribers page. Other updates like new title or new
   description are successfully syndicated to the subscriber. When
   investigating the WCM Portal Page on the subscriber you see the
   correct XML blob, however, the import of this XML does not
   remove the portlet.

   correct XML blob, however, the import of this XML does not
