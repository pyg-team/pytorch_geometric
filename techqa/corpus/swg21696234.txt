 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects IBM InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse C3000, C4000, IBM Smart Analytics System 1050, 2050, 5600, and 5710. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]

DESCRIPTION:The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100386 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100386] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.
