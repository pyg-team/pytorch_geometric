APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a Virtual Portal on the Welcome Page when the Portal User
   Interface heading link is clicked the following error message
   is
   displayed:
   
   Error 500: com.ibm.wps.services.identification
   .SerializationExceptionImpl: EJPDB0124E: the specified string
   [ibm.portal.Themes and Skins] can neither be deserialized as an
   objectID nor resolved as a unique name.
   
   Similar errors are generated when these other Admin heading
   links are clicked:
   Access, Portal Settings, Portal Analysis
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  export the following pages from the base Portal and import them
   into the Virtual Portal:
   ibm.portal.Themes and Skins,
   ibm.portal.Credential Vault,
   ibm.portal.Global Settings,
   ibm.portal.Frequent Users
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In a Virtual Portal on the Welcome Page when the Portal User
   Interface heading link is clicked the following error message
   is
   displayed:
   
   Error 500: com.ibm.wps.services.identification
   .SerializationExceptionImpl: EJPDB0124E: the specified string
   [ibm.portal.Themes and Skins] can neither be deserialized as an
   objectID nor resolved as a unique name.
   
   Similar errors are generated when these other Admin heading
   links are clicked:
   Access, Portal Settings, Portal Analysis
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem occurs because certain pages (the ones specified in
   the Local Fix) are not created for a Virtual Portal.  The fix is
   to modify the jsps to conditionally generate the links for these
   pages based on whther or not they are present.
