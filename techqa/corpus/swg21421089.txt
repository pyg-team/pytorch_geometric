 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document contains the known general problems and workarounds for all versions of IBM® Optim™ Performance Manager Extended Insight. 

SYMPTOM
You encounter a known problem when you use Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



The following general problems are identified for Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight: 

 * 
 * 
 * Problem: When you monitor an application that uses IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ, the Extended Insight dashboard might not show the statements that the application issues.
   
   Cause: The Extended Insight dashboard might not show the statements that an application issues if the following conditions are met:
    * The application uses a version of IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ that is not at the latest level. 
    * Extended insight monitoring is activated for the application after the application begins to issue statements.
   
   
   Workaround: Upgrade to version 3.59 or version 4.9 or later of IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ.
   
   
 * Problem: When you run the Extended Insight activation tool, the log file might indicate that WebSphere Application Server did not start successfully when it did start successfully. You can try logging in to the Optim Performance Manager Web console to see if WebSphere Application Server is running.
   
   
   
 * Problem: When you run the Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight activation tool in a Linux® or UNIX® environment, the tool needs 150 MB of temporary disk space in the root (/) file system.
   
   Workaround: If you do not want to use the root file system for temporary data, or if you do not have enough free disk space available in the root file system, specify a different file system for temporary files.
   
   When you run the activation tool, specify a different file system for temporary files by using the -DUSER_INSTALL_DIR parameter:
   
   ./activate_EI.bin -DUSER_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp
   
   where /tmp is a file system that has at least 150 MB of free space.
   
   
   
 * Problem: The command for installing Extended Insight on Linux on System p® is not included in the product documentation because support for this platform was added after the documentation was released.
   
   Workaround: To install Extended Insight on Linux on System p, run the following command:
   ./IBM_OPMEI_V4_1_Linux_ppc.bin
   
   To install Extended Insight silently on Linux on System p, run the following command:
   ./IBM_OPMEI_V4_1_Linux_ppc.bin -i silent -f path_to_response_file
   
   
   
 * Problem: During the installation of the product in console mode, the installation program prompts you for a user name. However, this instruction is not correct because you must enter the number of the user name that you want.
   
   Workaround: When the installation program in console mode prompts you for a user name, enter the number of the user name that you want, or press Enter to accept the default.
   
   
   
 * Problem: The Extended Insight configuration tool does not ensure that the db2dsdriver.cfg file is writable before attempting to modify it. If the db2dsdriver.cfg file is not writable, the configuration tool will fail to modify the db2dsdriver.cfg file, and the log file will indicate that the configuration was unsuccessful. (859474)
   
   Workaround: Ensure that the db2dsdriver.cfg file is writable. The db2dsdriver.cfg file is in the cfg directory in the installation path of the DB2 client that you want to monitor.
   
   
   
 * Problem: In the product documentation, the topic “Uninstalling DB2 Performance Expert Client” incorrectly states that you can uninstall the product in console mode by appending the –console option to the uninstallation command.
   
   Workaround: To uninstall DB2 Performance Expert Client in console mode, append the option –i console to the uninstallation command.
   


 * Problem: If you use Extended Insight to monitor an application that runs on WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0, the Extended Insight Analysis dashboard might not show response time data. Cause: WebSphere Application Server might produce a null pointer exception. If WebSphere Application Server produces a null pointer exception, the following message is written to the WebSphere Application Server SystemOut.log log file:
   
   DSRA9600W: The application server received an exception when posting 
   data to CMX. The exception is: java.lang.NullPointerException.
   
   

 * Workaround:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Problem: The Average Client Time value on the Extended Insight dashboard might be negative.



 * Problem: If you use DB2 9.8 base version, the Server Extended Insight feature is not supported.
   
   
   
 * Problem: The Optim Performance Manager Web console might take several minutes to show complete performance monitoring data for all partitions.
   
   Cause: When you use Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight to monitor a database that uses DB2 9.7 Fix Pack 1, it might take a few minutes for all of the performance monitoring data to be processed completely. 


 * Problem: When you use the deadlock event monitor or lock event monitor to collect statement history, the monitor heap for your computer runs out of space.
   
   Cause: This problem occurs under the following conditions:
   - You enabled the deadlock event monitor or lock event monitor in Optim Performance Manager to collect statement history.
   - Your system includes an application that runs a very high number of statements in a single unit of work.
   
   Workaround: Do one of the following tasks:
   - Increase the values of the DB2_MAX_INACTIVE_STMTS registry variable and MON_HEAP_SZ
   configuration parameter.
   - In Optim Performance Manager, turn off the collection of statement history for the deadlock event monitor, lock event monitor, or both.
   
   
 * Problem: If you use IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Application Diagnostics Version 7.1 Fix Pack 1, and if you configure a connection to use Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight information, you cannot integrate Optim Performance Manager with Tivoli monitoring in the connection. 
 * Problem: If multiple IP addresses are defined on the computer where Optim Performance Manager is installed, and the private address has a higher priority than the public address, then Optim Performance Manager will send the private address to the Extended Insight client, and the connection will fail. Workaround: Give the public address a higher priority than the private address, and then try again. 
   
    
   
   
 * Problem: If you register a DB2z data sharing group member for monitoring, and then unregister it and register another member of the same DB2z data sharing group, the Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight dashboard might not show any client statements or transaction metrics for the monitored data sharing group. Workaround: Restart the Optim Performance Manager repository server. During the next reconnection attempt (as defined by the value of the pdq.cmx.dataSourceLookupInterval configuration parameter), the application should obtain the correct monitoring port number. 
   
    
   
   
 * Problem: If you installed Optim Performance Manager on an operating system that is configured for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), and the IPv6 address has higher priority than IPv4, then the connection will fail if the network between Optim Performance Manager and Extended Insight does not support IPv6. If the connection fails, no extended insight data will display in the Optim Performance Manager web console. Workaround: Remove the IPv6 address from the computer where Optim Performance Manager is installed, or give the IPv4 address a higher priority than IPv6, and then try again. 
   
    
   
   
 * Problem: When the activation of Extended Insight is complete, the activation program displays the location of the log files. However, if the system temp directory does not contain enough space for the temporary log file, or if the user account that you are using does not have write permissions on the system temp directory, the IBM_ActivationTool.log file might not be created. Workaround: If you already activated Extended Insight, and the IBM_ActivationTool.log file was not created, there is no workaround. However, if you have not yet activated the product, you can ensure that the IBM_ActivationTool.log file is always created by appending the -Dlog option and specifying a path to a temporary directory and the name for the log file. For example, you can run the following command:
   
   On Windows: activate_EI.exe -Dlog=path_to_temp_dir\IBM_ActivationTool.log
   On Linux and UNIX: activate_EI.bin -Dlog=path_to_temp_dir/IBM_ActivationTool.log
   
   where path_to_temp_dir is a directory on which you have write permissions and which contains enough space to create a temporary version of the log file. When the activation is complete, the IBM_ActivationTool.log file is created in the directory that is indicated by the activation program.
   
   
   
 * Problem: When the installation of Extended Insight is complete, the installation program displays the location of the log files. However, if the system temp directory does not contain enough space for the temporary log file, or if the user account that you are using does not have write permissions on the system temp directory, then the OPMEI_install_summary.log file might not be created.

 * Workaround:
 * 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Problem: If you install Extended Insight V4.1.0.1 in GUI mode on HP-UX 11 V2, you might not see all of the text on the wizard pages.
