APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The trace entry
   ImbFormatNlsMessage::fileExists 'unable to locate file' ,
     'E:\IBM\MQSI\6.0\messages\;C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation
   Extender
     8.2\wmqi\messages\BIPv600_en_US.properties', 123
   
   Shows that the directory that the broker is looking to find the
   message library appears to be a contactination of the multiple
   values. This value is based on the MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH
   environment variable.
   
   Additionally, based on the WSTX command profile, this
   environment variable is set by appending to the variable.
   
   if not defined MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH set
       MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH=%DTXHOME%\wmqi\messages\
   if     defined MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH set
   
   MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH=%MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH%;%DTXHOME%\wmqi\messa
   ges\
   
   The WSTX command file only brought the error to surface. What
   the issue appears to be is that the mqsi
       ImbFormatNlsMessage::checkForPropertiesCatalog
   is not delimiting the semi colon for the two individual paths.
   The error is recreatable by setting the
      MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH=%MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH%;C:\temp
   
   The concatination of the path to any thing will cause the
   message
   libraries to not be found.  This occurs on WMB  version 6.0
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None other than do not have multiple NLSPATHS in the
   MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH variable.

   ****************************************************************
   Responses to WebSphere Message Broker
   commands issued from Windows command
   console are not sent correctly if
   environment variable
   MQSI_CONSOLE_NLSPATH has more than one
   file specified.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Broker code has been changed such that responses to
   WebSphere Message Broker commands issued from a Windows
   command console are sent correctly.
