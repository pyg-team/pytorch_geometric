QUESTION
 I have just upgraded directly from Telelogic DOORS 7.1 to IBM Rational DOORS 9.3 and I'm receiving errors when I open the upgraded modules that look like this:
'Unable to open module '.../.../ModuleName' No such file or directory C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\9.x\data\v6\...\...\m000xxxx1.mod\current.ver\treedata.dtc'
Why is this happening? 

CAUSE
There is a known defect logged with APAR ID PM21698 which has now been resolved in IBM Rational DOORS 9.3.0.3.

ANSWER
All migrations from a DOORS 7.x database to DOORS 9.3 should be done on only a DOORS 9.3.0.3 database. The DOORS database should also be configured to require a minimum client version of DOORS 9.3.0.3. See for more details: How to change the minimum and maximum Rational DOORS client version [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21442350]


Another alternative is to first migrate the DOORS database from DOORS 7.x to DOORS 8.3, and then to DOORS 9.x. 

Contact IBM Rational DOORS Client Support if you are facing module corruptions after upgrading directly to DOORS 9.x from DOORS 7.x to help you recover those modules.
