APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol is the
   industry stardard used for Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
   communication.
     This APAR allows selective TLS protocol selection for use by
     either a Tivoli Monitoring agent or a Tivoli Monitoring
   server.
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
     There is no product-provided means of setting or restricting
     the versions of Transport Layer Security to TLS 1.0, 1.1 or
   1.2 .
   Related Files and Output:
     The GSKit level and TLS protocol use is now presented in the
     RAS1 log during SSL initialization.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There is no GSKit v8 TLS protocol selection mechanism.
   
   
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol is the
   industry standard used for Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
   communication.  There is no product-provided means of setting or
   restricting the versions of Transport Layer Security to TLS 1.0,
   1.1 or 1.2 .
   
   In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment, a new environment variable has been added.  See the
   "Install Actions" section of the APAR conclusion for more
   details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR allows TLS protocol selection for use by either a
   Tivoli Monitoring agent or a Tivoli Monitoring server.  By
   default, TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 protocols are enabled for
   non-FIPS, non-SuiteB, non-CC, and non-SP800 users.  These
   keywords are NOT intended to be used for GSKit V8 users who run
   with specific subsets of GSKit protocols: FIPS mode, CC Mode,
   SP800 mode, or SuiteB mode.
   
   Install Actions:
   Assuming none of the specialized modes are enabled, the
   following GSKit/KDEBE environment variables can be set to
   disable their respective named protocols by setting the
   environment variable value to NO:
   KDEBE_TLS10_ON
   KDEBE_TLS11_ON
   KDEBE_TLS12_ON
   The final disposition of the TLS protocols are displayed during
   "ssl_provider_constructor" initialization in the RAS1 log.  The
   following is a display of the expected default settings when no
   overrides are configured:
   "ssl_provider_constructor") TLS 1.0 protocol enabled
   "ssl_provider_constructor") TLS 1.1 protocol enabled
   "ssl_provider_constructor") TLS 1.2 protocol enabled
   It is recommended that the <pc>.environment file in
   $CANDLEHOME/config be used to house these GSKit / KDEBE
   environment variables.  For example, to force the kuxagent to
   use TLS 1.2 exclusively, the following would be coded in the
   ux.environment file:
   KDEBE_TLS10_ON=NO
   KDEBE_TLS11_ON=NO
   These same statements in the ms.environment file would force the
   TEMS server in this CANDLEHOME environment to accept ONLY the
   TLS 1.2 protocol in SSL connection establishment.
