ABSTRACT
 Installation of ITM 6.0.3.2 in Windows to monitor MQ queue managers 

CONTENT
The purpose of this document is to provide a tutorial for installation of IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.3.0.2 in a Windows 7 machine. 

The overall objective is to have ITM and ITCAM services monitoring MQ queue managers in Windows and in Linux, and additional tutorials will provide steps for other components.

In order to keep the overall scenario as simple as possible, only the most essential components will be installed. Therefore, this tutorial does not show other ITM components; of course, if you need those ITM components, then you can go ahead and install/configure them.

These are the chapters:

Chapter 1 provides the details on how to download the software from IBM Passport Advantage.

Chapter 2 describes how to install these fundamental components:
TEMS - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
TEMA - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent

Chapter 3 describes how to install the GUI support:
TEPS - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
TEPD - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client

Chapter 4 describes how to install the ITM monitoring agents (these are NOT the agents that will monitor the MQ configuration and the MQ queue managers)
