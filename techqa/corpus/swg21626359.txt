 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am a new user to TAFs. I am importing using Music.sav sample file for my Data Source in TAFs. After the import, I am trying to export the result to Excel. When I go to File=>Export Result, I am getting message Export Cancelled.
Why I am not able to do the Export?
How can I fix it? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The behavior and message you are getting is normal. You are getting the error message because you don't have any Category to be export. If there is no category, you can create an empty category and move the Concepts from the bottom panel to your category. 

In TAFs, as you can see, there is no category being build and you will get an
error if you try to build the category.
Just go to Category => Create Empty Category. Give it a name.
Now Select one or more of the Concepts from below panel and move (drag) to the
category you created.
Now build the category

Now do your File..Export Result
