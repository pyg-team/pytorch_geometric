ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the customer is using VERBX DFHPD670 'LM=3' to format a

   excessive CPU utilization and spool output which causes an S878
   abend to occur.

   ****************************************************************
   A customer is using IPCS to format LM domain LMQUICK1 cell, but
   a loop is encountered and eventually an S878 abend. In DFHLMDUF,
   the buffer for QUICKCELL_1 is allocated after a GET_BLOCK, but
   it may be reused after a subsequent FORMAT_BLOCK call. If this
   happens, the QUICKCELL_1 does not contain valid contents and
   and this may lead to the loop and S878 abend.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHLMDUF has been changed so that the QUICKCELL_1_NEXT is saved
   before it calls DFHDUFUT again.
