ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description
   
   The customer is trying to extract information about object flows
   from an activity diagram. They use action pins on actions to
   type the object flows.
   They cannot find a way to identify the action that owns an
   action pin. The pin owner is shown as the activity, not the
   action.
   
   See attached document that shows the issue
   
   Action Pins should be owned by the Action
   
   Research
   
   In the OMG SysML Guide, it is stated that action pins are owned
   by their action
   
   "Starting an action:
   &#226; &#162; An action starts when a token is placed on all of its
   control inputs and all of its required inputs
   (must meet minimum multiplicity of its input pins) and the
   previous invoked activity has
   completed
   &#226; &#162; An action invokes an activity when it starts, and
   passes the tokens from its input pins to the
   input parameter nodes of the invoked activity"
   
   Use Case
   
   They want to identify the source of the object flow, which is
   the action that has the action pin that provides the object
   flow.
   They also are interested in the action being discover-able in
   ReporterPLUS, Rhapsody tables and RPE
   
   They want to be able to create information for documents that
   shows that Function A has an output Message A of Pin A which it
   provides to Pin B where it is consumed by Action B.
   Right now they can create tables in ReporterPLUS that show that
   Message A goes from Pin A to Pin B, but that's meaningless
   without knowing that Pin A is owned by Function A and Pin B is
   owned by Function B.
   
   The end game it to define the functional interfaces.

   In Rhapsody, all elements in statechart and activity diagram are
   owned by the diagram.
   The action is the parent of the pin.
   Anyway, there is a defect here that prevent showing the parent
   of an action.
   Please open a defect.
   We will find a way to solve this issue.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Displaying the owner of a Pin can be achieved by Tables using
   Java code.
   With 814, use the tables column type "User Defined Method" and
   specify a plugin method that implements the required content.
   See attached model for example of using a plugin method in a
   table in 256683_814.zip
   
   With 815 the tables were improved, and now it is possible to
   either use the 814 Java plugin, or use inline Java code.
   See attached model for example of using user Java implementation
   in 256683_815.zip
