APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to access a valid non-secured resource or
   content using the WCM servlet (ie: /wps/wcm/connect/.....) with
   an anonymous context, the request may fail and instead redirect
   to the WCM login page.
   
   
   This can occur under rare conditions where the current user is
   anonmyous and the login stack is corrupt (typically due to
   incorrect usages of custom code) which can then cause this
   anonymous user to incorrectly be treated as authenticated when
   accessing items via the WCM servlet.
