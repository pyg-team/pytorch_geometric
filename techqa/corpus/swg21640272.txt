Title: IBM TCR Report Scheduling fails after changing tipadmin password - United States

Text:
tcr schedules reports scheduler changed password tipadmin fails error authenticating user TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Changing tipadmin password causes failure with scheduled reports.
Setting back the original password makes TCR working fine again.
How to change tipadmin password and keep Report Scheduling working fine? 

CAUSE
Problem is related to the way Cognos manages user and password for some specific tasks.
Cognos keeps a copy of the user and password to execute the scheduled reports.
So, in case the scheduler uses tipadmin to perform its task, when tipadmin password is changed it is no longer able to authenticate the user.
You need an extra step to revalidate the credentials used by the scheduler.
This information is not documented by TCR but can be found in Cognos manuals.

ANSWER
This is the link to the Cognos manual you can use as reference:

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEP7J_10.1.1/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.tg_bitshoot.10.1.1.doc/t_scheduledreportsfail.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEP7J_10.1.1/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.tg_bitshoot.10.1.1.doc/t_scheduledreportsfail.html]

You need to follow the instructions reported here to revalidate the credentials used by the scheduler.
In a TCR context, you need to perform the following steps.

1) After having changed the tipadmin password, login to TCR with the new user/password combination
2) The "My Area" button mentioned in the above link is the icon on the left of the "Launch" menu.

3) Click the "My Area" button and select "My Preferences"
4) On the Personal tab, scroll to the Credentials section.
5) Click Renew the credentials.

Now the scheduled reports can be executed using the new credentials.
