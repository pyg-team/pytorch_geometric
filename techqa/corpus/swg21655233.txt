Title: IBM Understanding the warning message MIME conformance violation - United States

Text:
RFC; MIME; Conformance; CRLF; CR; LF; DataPower TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In my logs I observed the following message: 

MIME conformance violation: 7bit/8bit line too long (continuing)

What does this message mean and how is it resolved? 

CAUSE
Clarification of the cause of this warning message and it's effect are required.

ANSWER
DataPower sends this message to warn that the request is not in conformance with the 998 character limit set by the RFC 2045 standard which states that 7 bit and 8 bit parts of a MIME message must have no more than 998 characters between <CR><LF>'s. 

DataPower does not alter the message at all and simply warns the user that the message is not conforming to this standard, It is a warning that it is possible that a backend server could have an issue with messages not honoring this standard.
