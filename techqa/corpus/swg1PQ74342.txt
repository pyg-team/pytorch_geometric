APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has kept his MPR region up and running for a month and
   experiences the following error on module EKAPT:
   .
   CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE EKAPT EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT (32k)
   .
   which led to a EKA772E when his users went to the MSC panel.
   The use count for any module is a hard limit of (32767) and that
   is why they are seeing the CSV002I error message.  Everytime a
   user goes to the MSC panel the EKAPT gets loaded by DSLSRVP and
   it bumps up the 'use' count.  Once it reaches the limit (32K),
   it issues the CSV002I error message.
