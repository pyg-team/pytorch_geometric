APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  7.1.1.0 maxdemo, websphere environment, oracle database
   
   This problem appears to be system-wide in all applications.
   e.g.
   Go to  work order tracking , do a search for work order in WAPPR
   status
   this should bring up  with 147 records from the list tab
   tick select records checkbox
   tick a checkbox to select one record, it takes 5 - 6 seconds for
   the checkbox to be ticked
   tick a checkbox to select another record, it takes 5 - 6 seconds
   for the checkbox to be ticked
   bring up the task manager from the client workstation, click
   performance tab to see the CPU
   tick a checkbox to select another record, it takes 5 - 6 seconds
   for the checkbox to be ticked
   there's CPU spike when ticking checkboxes
   
   
   do the same test again, but instead of bringing up 147 records,
   bring up 10 records this time.
   you will see that the more records showing in the list the
   slower the
   performance.  It appears that Maximo is looking at every record
   in the
   list or table window every time a check box is selected and this
   causes
   sever performance hit on check box selection

   ****************************************************************
   Select Records mode on tables is very slow when opening and
   selecting a record. Large structure required to render tables
   with more than 20 rows makes refresh and render very slow.
