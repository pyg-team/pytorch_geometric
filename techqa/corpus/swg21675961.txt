PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Setting up Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) includes configuring the Summarization and Pruning agent to create and maintain the dimension tables. The explanation is incomplete. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
One of the required tasks for to setting up Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) includes configuring the Summarization and Pruning agent to create and maintain the dimension tables. This task is documented for IBM Tivoli Monitoring at the following URL:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2%2Fadminuse%2Ftcr_reports_dimensionspa_spt.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2%2Fadminuse%2Ftcr_reports_dimensionspa_spt.htm]

After completing this task, note that when the Summarization and Pruning agent starts, it configures a 24-hour timer for the maintenance of the ITM_TRAM tables for TCR reports. This 24-hour maintenance is not configurable and occurs every 24 hours after the start of the Summarization and Pruning agent.
