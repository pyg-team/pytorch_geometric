PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error: E-JPR-000-000: Failed to connect to mail server: javax.mail.MessagingException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target;
nested exception is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target 

CAUSE
Probe certificate store does not contain the email server certificate required for SSL handshake

ENVIRONMENT
Email probe with SSL mode enabled

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Enable SSL Java debugging and turn on nonnative logging from the nco_jprobe script.
2. Compare the certificate chain sent from the server with the probe truststore initialization in the nonnative log.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Import the server certificate into the SSL client's truststore
