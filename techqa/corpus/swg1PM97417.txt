APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A configEngine utility has been provided to allow customers
   to convert their JCR schema to one which supports DB2 HADR.
   Specifically it converts columns in ICMUTMWIDE0 table
   from being defined as
   BLOB(2G) NOT LOGGED
   to
   BLOB(1G) LOGGED
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The task is called
   reconfigure-jcr-for-hadr
   
   Notes:
   1)  This task will permanently change the JCR Schema.  Backup
   the JCR DB before executing this task.
   2)  This task will only work for DB2 LUW.
   3)  When running the task above, we STRONGLY recommend that
   Portal be down.
   4)  The task can take HOURS on systems with large volumes of
   content in the ICMUTMWIDE0 table.
   5)  The task can consume a large amount of DB2 Transaction log
   space on systems with large volumes of content in the
   ICMUTMWIDE0 table.
   6)  The task is re-runnable.  It will only try to reconfigure
   columns that have not yet been changed.
   7)  The task will retain all existing data in the ICMUTMWIDE0
   table except in the case where there is existing BLOB data that
   is larger than 1G in size.
   
   Execution:
   
   1) Stop all Portal Nodes
   
   Run the reconfigure-jcr-for-hadr task from the
   wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory on ONE Node Only
   
   Windows: ConfigEngine.bat reconfigure-jcr-for-hadr
   UNIX: ./ConfigEngine.sh reconfigure-jcr-for-hadr
   
   2)  Restart Portal upon completion.
