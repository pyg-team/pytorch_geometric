APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  No error but the behavior is not as expected.  The host name
   changes to "Local Computer".  The test cases on the following
   pages are not configured to run (e.g. if you have the page size
   set to 10, the 11th, 12th, etc. won't get executed.)

   information.
   
   Work around:   Use the "Show All" to display all the test cases
   in the suite or page through all the configured test cases
   before running the suite.

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Rational Quality Manager                                     *
   * Version 4.0.5                                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Steps to reproduce the issue:                                *
   * (1)Navigate to Manage Project Properties -->Lab Resource and *
   * Channel Properties and create a New Type called "Energy      *
   * Source".  Add the values of "Natural Gas", "Wind", and       *
   * "Solar" for the Energy Source type. Click the save button    *
   * (2)Navigate to Manage Project Properties -->Execution        *
   * Preferences and select the radio button for "Custom Search", *
   * the checkbox for "Energy Source", and the checkbox for       *
   * "Restrict reuse of lab resource if reserved for a Test       *
   * execution."  Click the save button.  -                       *
   * (3)Start the RQM command-line adapter.                       *
   * (4)Navigate to Execution -->Adapter Console and click on the *
   * machine name for the adapter started in step #3.             *
   * (5)Set the Energy Source to Solar on the lab resource for    *
   * the adapter machine                                          *
   * (6)Create 12 test cases each having a command-line script    *
   * associated to it                                             *
   * (7)Create a test suite and add the 12 test cases from step   *
   * #6 to the suite                                              *
   * (8)Create a test plan and add the test suite from step #7 to *
   * the plan                                                     *
   * (9)From the test suite section of the test plan, generate a  *
   * TSER with a test environment value of Energy Source=Solar    *
   * (10)From the test suite execution record section of the test *
   * plan, select the TSER and select "Run Test Suite"-->"Run"    *
   * (11)On the "Run Test Suite" window, confirm the Items per    *
   * page is set to 10, and then click the "Finish" button        *
   * (12)The problem, the 11th and 12th test case are not         *
   * configured to execute on the same machine as test cases 1    *
   * through 10, and as a result they end in error -              *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * Workaround: review all test cases in the suite by either     *
   * using "Show All" or paging through all of the configured     *
   * test cases before running the suite.                         *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Whenwe schedule it from Run Test Suite dialog, machine were
   reserved by ADMIN as well as 1st step was run by ADMIN. But
   subsequent steps were run by adapter users. We fixed this defect
   for the execution schedule
   Fixed in version 5.0
