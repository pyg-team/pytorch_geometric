APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Content Engine does not report any errors while adding documents
   to the Fixed Content Device (FCD).
   By analyzing the sub folders for the FCD, will see that almost
   all of the documents are being stored in only a few of the
   subfolders.  Will also notice that most of the other subfolders
   are not created.  This causes issues (slow performance, etc) on
   document retrieval.
   
   This occurs because four fifths of the Image Services (IS)
   document id is the
   same for all documents.  Using the causes the Content Engine's
   hashing algorithm to generate very poor randomization of sub
   folders used to hold the documents in the FCD.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * CFS-IS customers moving content from Image Services to a     *
   * NetApp SnapLock device                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * CFS-IS federated documents are assigned a Content Engine     *
   * (CE) object id based on the Image Services (IS) document     *
   * number.  Since IS document numbers are sequential integers,  *
   * the resulting CE object ids are very similar.  When CE       *
   * stores content in NetApp SnapLock, it locates the file in a  *
   * directory based on a hash of the CE object id.  With the CE  *
   * object ids being so similar, this results in many of the     *
   * files being located in the same NetApp SnapLock directory.   *
   * When too many files build up in a single directory,          *
   * retrievals and additions to that directory exhibit poor      *
   * performance.                                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.1.0.1-P8CE-FP001 or higher.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  5.1.0.1-P8CE-FP001 and higher will resolve this move content
   from Image Services to NetApp SnapLock problem.
