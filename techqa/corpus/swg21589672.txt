PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How does one recreate or restore the Access Roles back to factor defaults (as in during the object store creation procedure) so that way rebuild it properly without losing the contents of the current object store? 

SYMPTOM
Access Role was deleted in the FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) and no longer is found in the list of Application Engine Workplace (AEWP)- Site Preferences - Access Roles.


CAUSE
Access Role was deleted in FEM

ENVIRONMENT
CE 4.5.1


AEWP 4.0.2


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The objectID of the Access Roles are unique and associated with the Actions. Once the access roles are deleted and re-generated, they will have new objectID and any Access Roles previously assigned to the Action will need to be assigned and the deleted role removed. 

Steps to restore deleted default Access Roles:



 1.   Log into AE Workplace and go to the Site Preferences page. 
 2.  Under Bootstrap section, note the Preferences Settings / Object Store location and preference name. 
 3.  Take screen shots of all Actions that have Access Roles assigned. 
 4.  Take screen shots of all Access Roles that have members assigned 
 5.  Locate the bootstrap.properties file for AEWP which is located in the AEWP install location. For example: .\IBM\FileNet\Config\AE 
 6.  Stop the AEWP application server. 
 7.  Open FEM and navigate to the Object Store where the AEWP site preferences are stored. 
 8.  Under Root Folder / Access Roles, highlight an Access Role object an elect View -> Add/Remove Columns. Select Application Name and hit OK. 
 9.  Sort by ApplicationName and multi-select the items that match the AEWP Preference name. Right Click, select Multiselect Operations and Delete Objects. 
 10. Open the bootstrap.properties file in an editor, such as notepad. Locate the key objectStoreId=<ObjectStoreName> and remove the <ObjectStoreName> so it is blank. Eg. "objectStoreId=" and save it. 
 11. Restart the application server instance where AEWP is deployed. 
 12. Log into AEWP with the administrator account. The bootstrap page will open. 
 13. Enter the appropriate information, eg. Object Store and preference name and continue. 
 14. Open the Site Preferences page and set the appropriate values for the Access roles and Actions then remove any deleted Roles from the Actions. 
 15. Save and exit the Site Preferences. Confirm in FEM that the default Access Roles have been created.
