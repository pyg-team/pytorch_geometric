ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CUSTOMER 21ST CENTURY
   
   Title:  When provisioning policy modification exceeds Websphere
   Application Server transaction lifetime timeout, message should
   be
   written to logs.
   
   Problem Description:  Customer modifying a large provisioning
   policy
   with 30+ service entitlements and the modificate would not
   complete,
   even after running for 5 days.  There were no messages in the
   itim.log
   or WAS SystemOut.log that provided any reason for the problem of
   the
   modification not completing.  When the customer increased the
   WAS
   transaction lifetime timeout and inactivity timeout settings to
   larger
   values, then the provisioning policy modification completed
   successfully
   in a few minutes.
   
   Customer Recreate:  The customer is able to recreated the
   problem each
   time they try to modify their provisioning policy with large
   number of
   service entitlments.  Support attempted to reproduce the same
   kind of
   behavior but was not able to reproduce the exact same problem.
   
   Desired Behavior:  There should be some kind of timeout message
   written
   to the WAS SystemOut.log file or itim.log file when the
   provisioning
   policy modification exceeds the WAS transaction lifetime timeout
   settings.  The following message is shown in the WAS
   SystemOut.log file
   for other operations that exceed the WAS transaction lifetime
   timeout
   setting, so the same kind of message should be displayed when
   the
   provisionign policy modification exceeds the timeout setting.
   
   
   TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W:  Transaction ######:#######[] has
   timed out
   after # seconds.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:  Setup a large provisioning policy with 30+
   service
   entitlments such that a modificatin to the provisioning policy
   will
   result in the transaction exceeding the defined transaction
   lifetime
   timeout setting in Websphere Application Server.
   
   
   Environment:  ITIM 4.5.1 FP28
                 WAS 5.0.2
                 AIX 5.2

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *   This is being closed as a USEr error.  The ITIM Instal
   lation Guide directs the installer to raise this value after the
   WebSphere installation is complete, because we have determined
   that the default is too low for ITIM.  Further, the timeout is
   indeed logged in the ITIM log and should be a direct pointer to
   provide information needed to raise this value if needed.
