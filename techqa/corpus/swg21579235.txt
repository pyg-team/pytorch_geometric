Title: IBM TEPS Database not created when using MS SQL Server 2005 - United States

Text:
mssql; "ms sql"; dbo; "SQL Server"; TEPS; "Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server"; authentication; "Windows Only" TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS) does not allow domain accounts to create the database when using "Windows ONLY" authentication mode. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be encountered when TEPS database will use MS SQL Server 2005 or greater. 

 
1. Temporarily configure the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 computer to use mixed mode authentication (for example, SQL Server and Windows authentication). 

2. Install TEPS using install procedure in IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide 

3. After install, if the TEPS process is running, stop the process through the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services utility. 
4. Reconfigure the Microsoft SQL Server to use Windows authentication only. 
5. Access the Administrative Tools in the Windows Control Panel.

6. Access the Data Sources (ODBC). 

7. Select the System DSN tab. 

8. Select the "teps" data source and click Configure. 

9. Click Next until the window to designate the Microsoft SQL Server to verify the authenticity of the login ID appears.

10. Select With Windows NT(R) authentication using the network login ID. 
11. Click Next until the Finish button appears. Click the Finish button. 
12. Click OK and close the ODBC Data Sources control panel. 

13. Open SQL Server Management Studio. 

14. Expand Databases\teps\Tables. 

15. Right-click the teps.KFWDBVER table and select Design. 

16. In the Properties sidebar, change the schema from 'teps' to 'dbo'. 
(If prompted about permissions being dropped, click Yes.) 

17. Save the changes to the teps.KFWDBVER table. 

18. Refresh the teps database object and verify the KFWDBVER table is now part of the dbo schema. 
19 Open the Windows Control Panel ODBC Datasources and configure MSSQL ODBC datasource for the TEPS. 

20. Click next through the MSSQL Server ODBC Driver configuration, until a box is encountered that says: "Change the default database to:"

If the box is unchecked, check it and type the text "TEPS". 

22. Restart TEPS server.
