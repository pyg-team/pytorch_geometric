Select a document template file to add to the IBM Docs Integration plug-in IBM Content Navigator returns an error message stating that you must specify a valid template file, and the selected document mime type begins with application/x-vnd. 

However, valid mime types begin with application/vnd. This error occurs when you have a version of IBM Symphony or Open Office that was released before the mime type was approved in the OASIS specification. The characters x-vnd indicate a proposed standard mime type, and the characters vnd indicate an approved standard mime type. Your operating system maps the file extension to a mime type depending on how your installed applications registered the supported file extensions. 

Install a later version of IBM Symphony or Open Office, and if the mapping isn't automatically updated, you can manually update the mapping. Then, open IBM Symphony or Open Office, and open and save the document template file so that the file extension maps to a valid mime type. Now, you can add the document template file to the IBM Docs Integration plug-in. Select a document template file to add to the IBM Docs Integration plug-in IBM Content Navigator returns an error message stating that you must specify a valid template file, but no value is displayed for the selected document mime type. This error occurs in one of the following situations:  * You are adding a Microsoft Office document template file, but you don't have Microsoft Office installed on your workstation. 
 * You are adding an open standard document template file, but you don't have IBM Symphony or OpenOffice installed on your workstation. 

Install the appropriate software on your workstation.
