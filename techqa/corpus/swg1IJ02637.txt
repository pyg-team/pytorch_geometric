 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to reproduce
   
   1) In Organizations, select org EAGLENA then in menu action
   Inventory Options -> Inventory Counting
   2) Enter:
   - Count Items: NOISSUES
   3) Go to Storeroom and create a new storeroom STORE1
   4) Go to Part Number Master and create two records as following
   a)
   Part Number: PART1
   Status: Active
   
   b)
   Part Number: PART2
   Status: Active
   5) Add them to storeroom STORE1 with Current Balance like 100.
   6) In Inventory app, select PART1 in storeroom STORE1 then
   Issue Part to any asset or work order.
   7) Now is the tricky part: Put the system clock forward 31
   days. You may need to restart the maximo
   8) Now, repeat the step 6 for PART2. At this moment you had
   issued PART1 past 31 days  and PART1 today
   9) Go to Inventory Counting and create a new record
   - Count Book: CB1
   - Storeroom: STORE1
   - Selection Criterion: ALL
   10) Save
   11) Switch to Count Book Lines tab and verify records
   
   Actual result: Both parts PART1 and PART2 are displayed
   
   
   Expected result: NOISSUE, like NOBALANCE, excludes items that
   have a current balance of zero from the count book. In
   addition, NOISSUE excludes items that have had no issues or
   receipts in the last 30 days. The value in this field is a
   global setting. It is applied to the selection criteria
   specified in the Inventory Counting application.
   
   That means only PART2 should should be displayed since last
   time PART1 has been issued was past 31.
