PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Integration Designer (IID) does not support connection to a managed WebSphere Application Server network deployment environment as the process server test environment. It can, however support connection to an umanaged, stand-alone WebSphere Application Server network deployment environment as the Process Center. 

SYMPTOM
The following error occurs when you add a managed Process Server V7.5.1 to IBM Integration Designer as the process server test environment server in the Servers view: 


An error occurred during publishing: Could not publish to the server.


CAUSE
A managed (federated) WebSphere Application Server network deployment environment is not supported as a process server test environment. It can only support unmanaged (stand-alone) WebSphere Application Server network deployment.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Integration Designer V7.5 and IBM Integration Designer V7.5.1



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is a limitation in Rational Application Developer (RAD), which is the base for IBM Integration Designer. RAD does not support connections to the deployment manager as the process server test environment, and it does not support publishing to clusters or federated nodes. There is, however support for unmanaged (stand-alone) WebSphere Application Server network deployment; so you can test, run, and debug applications from the workbench to an unmanaged application server. As a result you may need a separate unmanaged node to be your UTE ENV.
