PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You experience excessive I/O (EXCP) in your CICS region when you enable a JVMSERVER resource that is configured for the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile. 

SYMPTOM
High I/O in CICS region with a Liberty profile enabled JVM server


CAUSE
By default, WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile monitor periodically checks for configuration and application changes by reading the z/OS UNIXÂ® file system.

ENVIRONMENT
JVM server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You see the EXCP count rising for the CICS region even though the region is performing no work.

You have a JVMSERVER resource enabled that is configured with the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, the JVM profile contains an entry for WLP_INSTALL_DIR.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Monitoring is controlled by elements in the Liberty profile server.xml file. Application monitoring is controlled by the <applicationMonitor> element and configuration update is controlled by the <config> element. You have a number of options to reduce I/O.

Edit the server.xml file, that is found by default in WORK_DIR/CICS_APPLID/JVMSERVER_NAME/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer. If you have set WLP_USER_DIR in the JVM profile, append servers/server_name to value to find server.xml (where server_name is either "defaultServer" or the value of -Dcom.ibm.cics.jvmserver.wlp.server.name in the JVM profile).





Add or change the elements as follows: 

 * If you are not using the dropins directory to deploy your web applications, disable monitoring of the dropins directory:
   
   <applicationMonitor dropins="dropins" dropinsEnabled="false">
   
   
 * Increase the configuration monitoring interval and the application monitor polling rate:
   
   <config monitorInterval="5s" updateTrigger="polled"/>
   <applicationMonitor dropins="dropins" dropinsEnabled="false" pollingRate="5s" updateTrigger="polled"/> 
   
   
 * If your Liberty server configuration is static and you will not be performing any updates while the server is active, disable dynamic configuration monitoring:
   
   <config updateTrigger="disabled"/>
   
   
   


Note: If you want to use CICS bundles to install your web applications, application monitoring update trigger (applicationMonitor updateTrigger) and configuration monitoring update trigger (config updateTrigger) must be set to polled.
