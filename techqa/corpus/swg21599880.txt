PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) performance degradation occurs during periods of high traffic in large TWS scheduling environments. 

SYMPTOM
The SystemOut.log file shows warning messages similar to:

0000001a ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread "ORB.thread.pool : 123" (00000245) has been active for 773732 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 153 thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.


CAUSE
The limit to the number of threads allowed to process TWS operations is reached causing a performance bottleneck. This scenario will only occur in large TWS networks with a high activity level.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following steps: 

1. Modify:
$TWA_HOME/eWAS/profiles/twaprofile/config/cells/DefaultNode/nodes/DefaultNode/servers/twaserver/resources-pme.xml

1a. Locate the Default Work Manager section:

<factories xmi:type="workmanager:WorkManagerInfo" 
xmi:id="WorkManagerInfo_Default" name="DefaultWorkManager" 
jndiName="wm/default" description="WebSphere Default WorkManager" 
category="Default" minThreads="1" maxThreads="10" threadPriority="5"
numAlarmThreads="5" isGrowable="false">. 

1b. Modify isGrowable to "true"

2. Restart the embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS):

(In conman, run stopappserver;wait and startappserver.)

This will allow eWAS to spawn more threads to process TWS operations.
