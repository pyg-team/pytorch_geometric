Title: IBM AWSUI0766E and AWSUI0833E messages trying to connect a DWC to a TWSz controller - United States

Text:
5697WSZ01 TIVOWEBUI subsystem mismatch TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to connect a TDWC to a controller and getting internal message EQQX145E 

CAUSE
TWSz server task is running a different TWSz release than the controller is running

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Messages seen in DWC: 

AWSUI0766E Test connection to [TWSR] : failed. 
AWSUI0833E The operation could not be completed. There has been a 
communication failure. 
The internal message is: EQQX145E THE SUBSYSTEM PROGRAM IS NOT OF THE 
CORRECT RELEASE 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The EQQX145E message is the key- it indicates that the TWSz server task is not running the 

same release of TWSz as the controller task to which it connects. This was not evident from the JCL 

as both the server and controller had the same SEQQLMD0 library name in the STEPLIB- however, 

this DSNAME was an ALIAS and the ALIAS pointed to a back-level copy of SEQQLMD0 where the 

server task was running.
