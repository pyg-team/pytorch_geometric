APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Multi-Protocol Gateway service that modifies the backend HTTP
   method from POST to GET by setting the
   var://service/protocol-method variable might generate the
   backend request as POST instead of GET. This happens in policies
    using a RESULTS action with the destination specified by a
   variable.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are DataPower services whose rules contain a RESULTS
   action with multiple destinations or a destination specified by
   a variable.
   
   The backside request from such a service might be generated with
   a different HTTP method than expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.3.
