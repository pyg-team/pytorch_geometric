APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Chapter 2 of the WebSphere MQ Version 7 "Using Java" manual
   contains a section entitled:
   
   WebSphere Application Server, Version 6 and the
   WebSphere MQ resource adapter
   
   The second paragraph of this section describes how to install
   and use the Resource Adapter within the application server.
   
   This is not supported.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  More information about support for WebSphere MQ JCA is at:
   .
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27009524 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27009524]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere MQ and WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.
   
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The information in the second paragraph of the section entitled:
   
     WebSphere Application Server, Version 6 and the
     WebSphere MQ resource adapter
   
   as well as the sixth paragraph and Table 2 of the section
   called:
   
     Installation of the WebSphere MQ resource adapter
   
   in the WebSphere MQ Version 7 "Using Java" manual is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The section called:
   
     WebSphere Application Server, Version 6 and the
     WebSphere MQ resource adapter
   
   should be rewritten to say this:
   
     The WebSphere MQ resource adapter should not be used within
     WebSphere Application Server, Version 6. To access the
     resources of a WebSphere MQ queue manager from within
     WebSphere Application Server, JMS applications should use the
     WebSphere MQ messaging provider, which contains a version of
     the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS.
   
   The section called:
   
     Installation of the WebSphere MQ resource adapter
   
   should be changed so that the sixth paragraph, which currently
   looks like this:
   
     Distributed transactions are supported by default in bindings
     mode but, in client mode, they are supported only in the
     following cases:
     - If you are using WebSphere Application Server, Version 6
     - For any other application server, if the extended
       transactional client JAR file, com.ibm.mqetclient.jar, is
       in the class path
   
   would read as follows:
   
     Distributed transactions are supported by default in bindings
     mode but, in client mode, they are supported only if the
     extended transactional client JAR file,
     com.ibm.mqetclient.jar, is in the class path.
   
   The Client mode entry for "Transacted connections" in Table 2
   also needs to be changed from:
   
     Supported if you are using WebSphere Application Server,
     Version 6 or if com.ibm.mqetclient.jar is in the class path
   
   to this:
   
     Supported if com.ibm.mqetclient.jar is in the class path
