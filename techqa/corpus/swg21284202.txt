QUESTION
You Lotus® Connections user changes her password, but she can still access the server using the old password as her credentials. What can cause this to occur?

CAUSE
IBM® WebSphere® Application Server (WAS) can cache the user name and password. As a result, after a user changes his password, the user can still log on while utilizing the old password. 

The old password will continue to function until the cache is expired.

You can disable the cache in WAS by following the steps below in the IBM Integrated Solutions Console (ISC). 

 

 1. Click Servers --> Application servers --> server_name. 
    
    
 2. Under Server Infrastructure, expand Java and Process Management section.
    
    
 3. Click Process Definition --> Java Virtual Machine. 
    
    
 4. Under Additional properties, click Custom properties --> New. 
    
    
 5. Under General Properties, specify the property name and its value. 
    com.ibm.websphere.security.util.authCacheEnabled 
    
    
 6. Click OK. 



**Note:**
