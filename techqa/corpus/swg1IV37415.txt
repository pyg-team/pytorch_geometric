APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Installation and Configuration Guide provides instructions
   on how to uninstall the low-level Web Response Monitor before
   you uninstall the Web Response Time monitoring agent.
   
   Manually uninstalling the Web Response Monitor before
   uninstalling the Web Response Time agent
   
   1. Stop the Web Response Time monitoring agent.
   
   2. From a command prompt, navigate to the wrm_images\install
   directory, typically located at
   
   %CANDLE_HOME%\tmaitm6\wrm_images\install
   
   3. Run the following command:
   
   setup.exe /s
   /f1%CANDLE_HOME%\tmaitm6\wrm_images\install\remove.iss
   /zuninstall /verbose\uninstall_wrm.log
   
   4. After this command completes, proceed with the uninstallation
   of the Web Response Time monitoring agent.
   
   The syntax of the setup.exe command in step 3 is incorrect. The
   setup.exe command syntax should read as follows:
   
   setup.exe /s%CANDLE_HOME%\tmaitm6\wrm_images\install\remove.iss
   /zuninstall /verbose\uninstall_wrm.log
   
   The complete path of the remove.iss file immediately follows the
   /s parameter. Note that a space must precede the /zuninstall and
   /verbose parameters. In the example shown for the /verbose
   parameter, the uninstall_wrm.log is written to the Windows root
   directory.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enter setup.exe command with correct syntax.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  * Docs fixed in 7.4 documentation. Section has been removed
   * since 7.4 does not install a separate WRM component. This
   * was done as part of APAR IV69045 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV69045]
