 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What can cause an STAP to fail to connect properly - I get the following messages in the logs:-

/tmp/guard_stap.stderr.txt on the DB Server :-
"Server <ip_addr> wasn't heard from for nn sec during this attempt (nnn sec total), closing and re-opening"

and from the Guardium Appliance - via fileserver in the /log/opt-ibm-guardium-log/snif/snif.log
"Unauthorized client connecting from <ip_addr> ,rejecting"


CAUSE
One reason for these errors could be that the S-TAP Approval Needed is checked in the S-TAP Certification screen on the Appliance like this :- 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22009818&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22009818&aid=1]





ANSWER
Uncheck the Approval box and the S-TAPs should start connecting .
