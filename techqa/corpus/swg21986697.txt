VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0705 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
CVEID: CVE-2016-0797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0797]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0799 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory error in the BIO_*printf() functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to trigger an out-of-bounds read.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2842 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2842]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds by the doapr_outch function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted string to cause an out-of-bounds write or consume an overly large amount of resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111304 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111304] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
