ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you choose the option in preferences to display unread mail
   in Plain red
   text (the default is Bold Black text) and then perform a search
   the unread docs
   become Bold Red Text. This does not revert to plain red text
   unless yo go back
   and reset the preference.
   I have tested this in 8.5.2 11/10 build and reproduced., it
   appears to be a
   problem with all releases using the Plain Red Text for unread
   entries.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. In your mail file go to Preferences and choose Fonts and
   Colors
   2. For the Unread Mail Indication select Plain red text in the
   dropdown
   3. Apply and save your changes and the setting takes effect.
   4. Perform a search on something that will return several docs,
   the word 'Mail"
   should give a good return.
   5. Scan through the results and if the result set includes
   unread docs , you
   will see that they are now Bold Red.
   6. Clear the search and now your unread messages will continue
   to be Bold red.
   
   You can reset the preferences but after searching the setting
   will remain Bold
   red.
   
   Theory:
   We use Bold Black as the default and the search routine sets the
   bold bit for
   unread documents and we did not change that to consider the new
   preference.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Re Apply the preference
