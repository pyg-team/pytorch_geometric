 * HP PA-Risc


Note: For platforms that do use the GUI, follow the installation instructions provided in the IBM Rational ClearQuest Information Center: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m0/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m0/index.jsp]. To silently install Rational ClearQuest:

1. If the ESD image is not available through a UNC or NFS path: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * esd_image_root
 * 
 * 


2. If the ESD image is available through a UNC or NFS path, copy the file esd_image_root/product_response_platform.xml onto a writeable disk. 

3. Open and read the license agreement files located in <varname>esd_image_root</varname>/license_agreements. xx indicates the language of the file. The files are:  * 
 * LA_xx
 * 
 * 
 * LI_xx
 * 
 * 
 * non_ibm_license
 * 
 * 
 * notices


4. Open the response file, product_response_platform.xml. 

5. If you agree to the license agreement, change the value for the acceptLicense key to true. 
 * <agent-input acceptLicense='true'>


6. Change the value for the repository location key to ' esd_image_root/diskTag.inf'. 
 * <server>
   <repository location='esd_image_root/diskTag.inf'/>
   </server>


7. Follow the comments within the response file to configure your product's installation. 

8. Open the file esd_image_root/InstallerImage_$platform/install.xml. Find the version key and copy the value. You use this value in the next step. For example: 
 * <install>
   <offering id='com.ibm.rational.clearquest.platform' version='7.1.0.00-7-1-NR-D09MMDD'/>
   </install>


9. Open the response file. In the <install> command, update the version attribute for the offering key with the value copied from the install.xml file. If the version attribute is not listed for the offering key in the response file, you must add it. 
 * <install>
   <offering profile='IBM Rational SDLC' version='7.1.0.00-7-1-NR-D09MMDD' id='com.ibm.rational.clearquest.platform' features='com.ibm.rational.clearquestunix.core,....'/>
   </install>


10. If IBM Installation Manager is not installed, you must install it. If an older version of Installation Manager is installed, it must be upgraded. To install Installation Manager that is bundled along with the product or to upgrade the current installed version of Installation Manager, follow the instructions below. 
 * 

 * <repository location='esd_image_root/InstallerImage_$platform'/>

 * 
 * esd_image_root/InstallerImage_$platform/install.xml

 * 

 * <install>
   <offering features='agent_core,agent_jre' id='com.ibm.cic.agent' version='1.3.0.20090211_1046'/>
   </install>

 * 

 * <server>
   <repository location='esd_image_root/diskTag.inf'/>
   <repository location='esd_image_root/InstallerImage_$platform'/>
   </server>
 * 
 * 
 * 

 * <install>
   <offering features='agent_core,agent_jre' id='com.ibm.cic.agent' version='1.3.0.20090211_1046'/>
   <offering profile='IBM Rational SDLC' version='7.1.0.00-7-1-NR-D09MMDD' id='com.ibm.rational.clearquest.platform' features='com.ibm.rational.clearquestunix.core,....'/>
   </install>
