Title: IBM Deploying IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture on a WAN - United States

Text:
WAN LAN architecture deployment TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the best practices for deploying Datacap servers and clients on a wide area network (WAN)? 

ANSWER
Remote users that access Datacap over a WAN can use Taskmaster Web-based "thin clients", or FastDoc Capture operating in offline mode. Datacap thick clients (DotScan, DotEdit) and utilities (NENU, Fingerprint Maintenance Tool) require LAN communication speeds and low latency for responsive performance. 

Connect all Datacap Taskmaster Servers, Rulerunner Servers, Web Servers, file servers and databases to a single high performance LAN for best results. Network delays between Taskmaster Server, shared files and databases causes degraded performance of Job Monitor and data intensive operations. 

Some customers successfully operate Datacap thick clients in remote sites using Citrix or other remote access technology. IBM has not tested or sought certification with Citrix, and does not provide support for Citrix. If you deploy Datacap clients on Citrix and encounter issues, IBM may require you to reproduce the issues outside of Citrix as part of the investigation. 

Consult the IBM Redbooks titled "Implementing Imaging Solutions with IBM Production Imaging Edition and IBM Datacap Capture", section 2.5, for deployment recommendations and diagrams.
