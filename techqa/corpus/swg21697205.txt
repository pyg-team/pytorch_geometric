 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Tivoli Netcool System Service Monitors/Application Service Monitors has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.

CVSS Base Score: 2.600
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.

CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.

CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 4.300
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources.

CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
