Text:
CVE-2015-3566 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM DataPower Gateways has addressed a Padding Oracle Protection vulnerability in GatewayScript decryption. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7412 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7412]
DESCRIPTION: IBM DataPower Gateways GatewayScript modules may be vulnerable to Padding Oracle attacks in some scenarios, which could allow an attacker to decrypt the captured message, and other messages encrypted using the same cryptographic keys.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107532 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107532] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM DataPower Gateway appliances version 7.2.0.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Fix is available in versions 7.2.0.1. Refer to APAR IT10701 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT10701] for URLs to download the fix. 

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
This vulnerability exists only in IBM DataPower Gateways functions configured with a JWE decrypt action, or using the GatewayScript decryption API. 

Requiring the ciphertext to be signed by the sender, and verifying that signature as a prerequisite to performing decryption will address the vulnerability.
