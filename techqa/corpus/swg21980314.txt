QUESTION
 I deployed Remote Control in my production system with Derby database and my database is corrupted. I need to recover the situation. 

ANSWER
DERBY db is not supported in production system and can only be used for POC or test deployments as reported in the official documentation:
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS63NW_9.2.0/com.ibm.tem.life.doc_9.2/Remote_Control/RC_Install_Guide/rcinst_server_install.html?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS63NW_9.2.0/com.ibm.tem.life.doc_9.2/Remote_Control/RC_Install_Guide/rcinst_server_install.html?lang=en] 

If you don't have a DB backup, the only way to recover the system is by:
- stop IBM Remote Control server service
- move the TRCDB folder outside TRC installation path 
- restart the IBM Remote Control server service 

The system is now recovered but you will need to reconfigure all policies/users/groups
