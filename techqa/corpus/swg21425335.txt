PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, ClearCase CM Server: Error: Can't pick element type from rules in "C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\ClearCase\config\magic", that can occur when checking in a file using IBM Rational ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC). 

SYMPTOM
 

Attempting to check in a file element such as TXT or XML fails with an error: 

 

Can't pick element type from rules in "C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\ClearCase\config\magic"

You will also see the following messages: 


CRVAP0087E CCRC command 'Mkelem' failed: Unable to create new element for <view path> 


ClearCase CM Server: Error: Vob server operation "Create Container" failed. 

This issue is most commonly seen with IBM Rational ClearQuest UCM enabled projects.



CAUSE
 

The path to the magic file may have permission settings that are blocking access.


ENVIRONMENT
 

Windows 2003 CM Server
. 

Windows XP Clients. 

Region Mapping File has been setup. 

ClearCase, ClearQuest, Requisite Pro. 

Testfix (IFix 4) was applied to address java null pointer errors. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

Gather IBM Rational Change Management (CM) Server Logs and a Clearbug [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21131335]. 

Verify magic file location and that directories up from that location have the proper access values set and are not too restrictive. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Recursively set the permission's for the magic file location , giving the "Everyone" group "Read, Write, and Execute" access from the top level of ClearCase down. 

Uninstall and Re-install CM Server for both ClearCase and ClearQuest. 

 

WORKAROUND 

Copy the magic file information to another location. Use the MAGIC_PATH variable to point to this new location.
