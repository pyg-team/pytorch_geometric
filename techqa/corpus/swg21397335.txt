PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WASServiceCmd.exe is a front end for WASService.exe, which is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. WASService.exe is required in its default directory for adding, updating, and removing WebSphere Services in Windows.

Notice: In WebSphere Application Server v8 and later, this utility is shipped with the product under the name of WASServiceHelper.bat in the bin directory.

See DeveloperWorks article for detailed information: (Link at the bottom of this document) 

SYMPTOM
Creating and removing a WebSphere service in Windows is confusing and error prone.


CAUSE
This application takes several parameters which can be confusing to the user along with several long path strings leaving opportunities to setup incorrectly.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Place the WASServiceCmd.exe utility in the following directory:
    
    install_root\bin 
    
 2. Launch the command from the command line. 
    
    
 3. The WASServiceCmd utility prompts you to select specific options and settings from a list and then calls the WASService.exe command passing all selected parameters. This greatly reduces the time it takes to create a Windows service for WebSphere Application Server and reduces the opportunity for user errors.

Note: This also creates an entry in the WASServiceCmd.log in the current directory which contains the actual WASService.exe command used to create the service. 

Example of a log entry: 

[Fri Aug 14 12:22:01 -0500 2009] WASService.exe -add "Deployment Mgr01" -serverName "dmgr" 
-profilePath "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01"
-logRoot "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr"
-logFile "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr\WS_startdmgr.log" -encodeParams -stopArgs "-username vanno -password ****** " 
-startType manual 
-restart false WASServicecmd.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=2] 

Notice: Some browsers are having trouble downloading this file and getting docview.wss instead. Download this file, then rename the file with a ".zip" extension (for example, docview.zip or WASServiceCmd.zip). You can now access the utility.
