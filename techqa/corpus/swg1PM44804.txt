ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - Microsoft Windows XP SP1/2
    - IBM Rational Software Architect/Modeler 7.5.5.3
    - IBM Requisite Pro 7.1.1
   
   Reproducible Y/N: Y
   
   Description of problem:
   When you try to link a UML Element in IBM Rational Software
   Architect/Modeler
   with the ReqPro Repository, by dragging and dropping the element
   to the ReqPro project
   in the Requirement Explorer to create a new Requirement, the
   following error occurs:
   
   'IRJQ0054E Error creating requirement.
   
   Application uses a value of the wrong type for the current
   operation'.
   
   This error occurs when the documentation, linked to the UML
   element contains rich
   text formatting.
   Then the resulting requirement text gets too long for the
   requirement text field
   in the DataBase.
   The message should be more specific.
   
   When dragging and dropping the UML element on an already
   existing requirement,
   or when first creating  the requirement
   from the UML which does not have import documentation
   attached,the following message
   pops up:
   'IRJQ0062E Requirement 'Activityx Activityx' text could not be
   updated
   Reason: The data lenght is out of range.
   (must be ?=64000)'
   
   We expect to get the same error message dialog if we create or
   link existing requirement
   to UML elements which contains rich text documentation
   
   Workaround:
   You can only avoid the documentation long content to be copied
   over to the text
   of the ReqPro requirement, if you set the synchronization policy
   to 'none'
   for the requirement type.
   This way it will never update the requirement text and name for
   any requirement
   of this type with content of the RSA element.
   But you would still first need to create the requirement in the
   requirement explorer
   and then link it to the UML Element.
