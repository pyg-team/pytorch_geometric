APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Server Name Indication (SNI) is a method for specifying the
   required certificates on a system hosting multiple services
   using different certificate sets.
   
   SNI is not currently sent with HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest
   nodes.  This will add support for SNI.
   
   If SNI is required, you may see an error like this in the
   ExceptionList or JSSE trace:
   SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
