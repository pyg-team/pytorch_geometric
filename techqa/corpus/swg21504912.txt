PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to update the web.xml file of the IBM WebSphere Application Server profile for the IBM Rational ClearQuest Report Launcher results in an "$AdminApp update" error. 

SYMPTOM
When running these command commands:


wsadmin>wsadmin -connType SOAP
WASX7209I: Connected to process "server1" on node dfltNode using SOAP connector;
The type of process is: UnManagedProcess
WASX7029I: For help, enter: "$Help help"
wsadmin>$AdminApp update birt_war.ear file {-operation update -contents web.xml -contenturi birt.war/WEB-INF/web.xml} 

... this error occurs: 

WASX7015E: Exception running command "$AdminApp update birt_war.ear file {-operation update -contents web.xml -contenturi birt.ar/WEB-INF/web.xml}"; exception information:
com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingException: WASX7280E: An application with name "birt_war.ear" does not exist.



CAUSE
The web application might not be called "birt_war.ear" as the Report Launcher readme.html indicates in step 4.4.9.b. The Report Launcher readme.html file is located in the Report Launcher download.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Find the appropriate application name in the readme.html file step 4.4.3. The name of the link label for the Enterprise Application of your BIRT deployment is the name that should be used in the wsadmin syntax. For some BIRT versions you will see birt_war, not birt_war.ear, or some other name as defined during the deployment of the BIRT runtime.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the correct application name for your BIRT runtime, as indicated inside of the WebSphere Application Server console for your WebSphere Application Server profile. Here is the corrected command line for this example: 

wsadmin>$AdminApp update birt_warfile {-operation update -contents web.xml -contenturi birt.war/WEB-INF/web.xml}
