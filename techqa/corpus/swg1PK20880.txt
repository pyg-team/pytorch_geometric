APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Business Monitor generates CMP beans that contain
   EJBQL code that specifies TRUE=TRUE in some cases.  When run on
   WebSphere Application Server v6.0.1 this worked fine but as of
   v6.0.2.3 it fails.
   The problem is that the TRUE=TRUE is not being translated to 1=1
   in the SQL statement in the generated EJB deployment code, but
   rather it is left as TRUE=TRUE which is invalid SQL for DB2.

   ****************************************************************
   The EJB Deployment code contains a TRUE=TRUE SQL statement
   rather than 1=1 for EJB-QL that specifies TRUE=TRUE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The EJB-QL deployment code now property translates TRUE=TRUE
   EJB-QL to 1=1 in the EJB Deployment code.
