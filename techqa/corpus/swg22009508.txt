QUESTION
 How can I change the Password of the System User in IBM TRIRIGA? 

ANSWER
The User can check this in My Profile [Application] --> My Profile [Tab]-->Account Details [Section] for system password change.
Although, you can create a manual Association in TriPeople , it is best and easiest for the user to simply run a query against the My Profile records in the System Reports.
You can do this by selecting the system My Profile record and edit to the correct password as required.
