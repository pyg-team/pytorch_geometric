Title: IBM Using License Keys with Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How does Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode change the license keys used to activate software functions? 

CAUSE
Data ONTAP 8.1 introduces a new licensing functionality that allows a single key to unlock multiple software components for specific N series storage systems. With this new addition to the Data ONTAP licensing schema, a single license key can unlock a group of software products as described in the following tables.

ANSWER
How are license keys installed? 

License keys are typically installed by IBM prior to delivering the product to the user. For an add-on software (not purchased as part of a system), the license keys described in the following tables have to be installed as described in the Related information section. The tables below are based on currently sold licensed products, and identify the license key that must be installed in order to use specific products.

How do I determine which license keys to use?
License key usage will vary based on the platform, so this information is intended to help determine the key that is needed for a given product on a given platform. A license key can be used to unlock multiple products (for example, the SnapManager for Exchange license key unlocks all products in the SnapManager Suite) or a single product (for example, FlexClone).

Note: To support the new licensing schema introduced with Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode and the old licensing schema used with prior Data ONTAP releases, both the license keys that activate a group of features, and the individual license keys that represent each feature, are provided for the features ordered.

Where can I find the license keys? 
License keys are provided with the system on a Functional Authorization Form. For products and features that are purchased separately, these are also sent to the customer on a similar form. 

Does IBM provide a single license key for products that include multiple software components or is a key provided for each component? 
IBM typically provides a key for each component, but the licensing functionality starting with the Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode release allows a single key to unlock multiple components (e.g., SnapManager Exchange license key unlocks all components in the SnapManager Suite). Please refer to the tables above to see which license key unlocks all components of a particular offering. 

What are the requirements prior to upgrading to Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode? 
Prior to upgrading to Data ONTAP 8.1 7-Mode, IBM recommends installing all designated license keys for your platform. RELATED INFORMATION
