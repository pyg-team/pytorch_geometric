Title: IBM ICC Configuration Access service does not start - United States

Text:
Listener.dll; 1641967; 1722; Error 1053 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Content Collector (ICC) Configuration Manager and Task Routing Engine do not start when Filenet IDM WebServices are installed. 

SYMPTOM
On attempting to start the ICC configuration Manager, the "IBM Content Collector Configuration Access" service hangs and finally fails with error: 

Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.


CAUSE
The reason for this error is that there is a conflict with a listener.dll file used by another IBM product such as IBM Filenet IDM Webservices. 

The ICC FNSysManApiWrapper.dll file is looking for a listener.dll from FileNet System Manager, but it sees the other listener.dll instead which it does not recognise, therefore causing the problem. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use Windows Process Explorer to monitor the dlls in use by the ICC installation. 

When the TaskRoutingService.exe is monitored, the listener.dll can be seen. Then a check can be performed on the installation directories of any other IBM Filenet products for the presence of the same dll.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The simplest solution is to remove the dll, assuming that IBM Filenet System Manager is not being used. 

Remove the file 'FNSysManAPIWrapper.dll' from <ICC install folder>/ctms
(eg: 'C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\ContentCollector\ctms' ) 

If IBM Filenet System Manager is being used then please contact IBM Support for further assistance.
