ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows Only.
   
   Problem Description:
   Reconfiguration of agents that require Java may fail after ITM
   6.2.3 GA,FP1, or FP2 is installed. The problem does not occur
   when ITM 6.2.2 FP9or ITM 6.2.3 FP3 is installed.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Install Microsoft Agents CD Agent for IIS.
     2. Install ITM 6.2.3 FP1 or FP2 NT agent. After the install
        the agents
        all report properly.
     3. Reconfigure the IIS agent. It will not longer start.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Review the K??ENV file and review JAVA_HOME= or K??_JAVA_HOME=
   setting. It should be HOME\java\java50\jre where HOME is
   CANDLE_HOME.
   
   It may indicate @JAVA_HOME@ or some other value. Java must be
   installed into the directory pointed to by the *JAVA_HOME
   setting or it must be installed. The Agentless agents require
   Java but the NT agent doesn't.
   
   If a remote machine is being used Java can be deployed to the
   remote machine, but it cannot be installed locally without an
   agent that requires it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Reconfiguration of agents that require Java may fail after ITM
   6.2.3 GA, FP1, or FP2 is installed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Problem does not occur in 6.2.3 FP3 or 6.3 FP2 and
   later.
