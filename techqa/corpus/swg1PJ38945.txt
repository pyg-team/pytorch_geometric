APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Existing documents that are stored in IBM Content Manager
   already have document permissions configured. When the existing
   documents are added to a case, the case folder permissions are
   merged with the document permissions. This situation can
   potentially allow a case worker with access to the case folder
   to access documents they should not be able to access under the
   original security settings of the document.
   
   With the fix of this APAR, document permissions are no longer
   affected by case folder permissions.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * This will affect all case workers that add documents to a    *
   * case                                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * A user who has limited access to a document but who has      *
   * higher levels of access to the case can obtain an elevated   *
   * level of access to the document by filing it in the case     *
   * folder.  Filing the document in a case folder causes the     *
   * case folder permissions to be dynamically merged with the    *
   * document permissions.                                        *
   *                                                              *
   * For example, a case worker who has read-only access to a     *
   * document can acquire write or even delete access to the      *
   * document by filing it into a case folder.                    *
