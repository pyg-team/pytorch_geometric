APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The @JournalEntry adds journal entry as 'root' user even if
   the Impact server and event reader is connected as the 'impact'
   user.
   
   We need the ability to track event updates by Impact.  When ever
   our Impact policies change an event we add a journal entry to
   that event describing the change. Using the @JournalEntry state
   variable I would assume that Impact would add the journal entry
   under the context of the user in which it is connected to the
   object server as but this is not the case.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Suggested they create a data type which points to the
   alerts.journal table. Then using the AddDataItem function,
   you can specify the user of your choice by assigning it to the
   UID field. You'll need to be mindful that you're properly
   filling out the other alerts.journal fields, i.e. Serial. Be
   sure to add, any of those users you've defined within your
   policy, into the Object Server.

   Steps to replicate: 1) Configure Impact Server 2) Create policy
   to update Journal:    @JournalEnter=test;    @Location=test;
   ReturnEvent(EventContainer); 3) Configure EventReader to use
   the policy 4) Run the EventReader and observer the user who
   updates the Journal Enter in Omnibus Event Viewer Default user
