ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following messages are issued when you click the
   File transfer administration icon on MQ Explorer view
   on Windows to connect to the z/OS queue manager.
   CSQX053E xxxx CSQXFFST Error information recorded in CSQSNAP
                 data set
   CSQX541E xxxx CSQXRESP Invalid CCSIDs for data conversion, 819
   and 5035 for channel ????
   CSQX228E WMQC CSQXRESP Listener unable to start channel, channel
               ,TRPTYPE=TCP INDISP=QMGR
   Need support for CCSIDs 5035 and 5026 with WMQFTE plugin.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WMQ v7 Application Programming Ref manual details that WMQ z/OS
   does not support CCSID mapping of 819->5026 nor 819->5035.
   
   Both the GUI and any remote agents using a client connection
   would be unable to establish a connection to a remote queue
   manager using an incompatible ccsid. This issue would be
   highlighted by an error in the associated output logs clearly
   displaying the the following MQ error code on the connection
   attempt:
    CC=2;RC=2059;AMQ9503: Channel negotiation failed.
   [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]
   Further information on the supported conversions, per platform,
   is available from the following hierarchy in the infocenter:
    http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?t
   opic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzak.doc/fr20890_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzak.doc/fr20890_.htm]
   
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users attempting to use an MQ client connection between a
   client and qmgr of differing Coded Character Set Identifiers
   (CCSIDs) that WebSphere MQ does not support translation between.
   
   PLATFORMS AFFECTED:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to always use UTF-8 (1208) as the source CCSID for
   client connections, as this is readily translatable to and from
   all common CCSIDs
