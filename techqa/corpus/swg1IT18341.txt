APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For either BLOCKADDR or BLOCKUSER in a CHLAUTH rule you can
   provide a list of addresses or users.
   .
   For each of these fields the type is listed in the MQ Knowledge
   Center as:
   .
   AddrList (MQCFSL)
   A list of up to 100 IP address patterns which are banned from
   accessing this queue manager on any channel
   (parameter identifier: MQCACH_CONNECTION_NAME_LIST).
   .
   UserList (MQCFSL)
   A list of up to 100 user IDs which are banned from use of this
   channel or set of channels
   (parameter identifier: MQCACH_MCA_USER_ID_LIST).
   .
   It was discovered that, if the command server's response from
   the MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS command contained multiple IP
   addresses or user IDs, the PCF message conformed to that listed
   in the MQ Knowledge Center.  That is, the field type was MQCFSL.
   However, if the response contained a single IP address or a
   single user ID, the field type was MQCFST.
   .
   In MQ Java, when you inquire the PCF message fields
   MQCACH_CONNECTION_NAME_LIST and MQCACH_MCA_USER_ID_LIST you
   have to use the getStringParameterValue method when there is
   only 1 user or address and the getStringListParameterValue
   method when there are multiple addresses or users.
   .
   The exception triggered when using the
   getStringListParameterValue when only one address or user is
   blocked is:
   .
   Exception:
   java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast
   to java.lang.String
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This affects users of PCF applications, which query channel
   authentication (CHLAUTH) records of type BLOCKUSER or BLOCKADDR.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When responding to an inquire chlauth request
   (MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS) for BLOCKUSER or BLOCKADDR records,
   the MQ queue manager's command server incorrectly returned the
   MQCACH_MCA_USER_ID_LIST and MQCACH_CONNECTION_NAME_LIST fields
   as string type (MQCFST) instead of string list (MQCFSL) if there
   was only one item the list.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ queue manager's command server logic has been updated to
   always return MQCACH_CONNECTION_NAME_LIST and
   MQCACH_MCA_USER_ID_LIST as a string list type (MQCFSL) in its
   response to the MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS command.
