icc; ctor TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the password for the user connecting to P8 Content Engine (CE) is updated, indexing for all IBM Content Collector (ICC) documents failed with error FNRCE0040E: E_NOT_AUTHENTICATED with indexing failure code of 1. 

CAUSE
 

 * P8 user password was changed and updated in ICC Configuration Manager. 
 * But ICC constructor in Content Search Services (CSS) is not reading the updated password information. 
 * During indexing, ICC constructor still uses the old password to connect to the P8 repository to retrieve documents resulting in the authentication error.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector 

P8 Content Search Services 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Ensure that the new password is updated and saved via the ICC Configuration Manager, Connectors > P8 Connections. 
 * Use the following link to check that the information saved in ICC configuration store is correct.
   https ://<icc_server_name>:11443/AFUConfig/Configuration?type=ibm.ctms.ContentSearchService&unique=email
   Replace <icc_server_name> with your actual ICC server host name. 
 * On the CSS server, rename this file:
   IBM\ContentSearchSevices\CSSServer\config\afu_config_Email.cache
   This is a hidden file on Windows. 
 * Ensure ICC Web Application Service is running. Restart CSS service. 
 * Reindex the failing documents.
