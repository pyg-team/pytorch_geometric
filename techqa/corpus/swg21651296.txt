 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to run a Data Manager build via the data movement service fails with an error.

Unsetting the DM_AUDIT_DB and DM_AUDIT_DB_DRIVER variables removes the error but no audit information is written. 

SYMPTOM
DM-DBM-0400 UDA driver reported the following on connection ALIAS_0106BD90
UDA-SQL-0107 A general exception has occurred during the operation "columns".
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
UDA-SQL-0196 The table or view "dsb_sequence" was not found in the dictionary.


CAUSE
Data Manager audit tables don't exist in the audit database

ENVIRONMENT
Windows


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check DM_AUDIT_DB and DM_AUDIT_DB_DRIVER variables

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
DM_AUDIT_DB and DM_AUDIT_DB_DRIVER variables were set but were pointing to a separate database to the Data Manager catalog database. The audit database did not contain the Data Manager audit tables.
Either change the audit variables to use the Data Manager catalog database for auditing or create the audit tables in the audit database. The simplest way to do this is to create a new Data Manager catalog in the audit database as this will create the audit tables automatically.
