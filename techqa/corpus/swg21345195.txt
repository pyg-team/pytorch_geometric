Title: IBM E300 and change in ownerpercentage to 100%. - United States

Text:
E700 etyp 90 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why is value on OB-account not counterbooked on account for Change in Group Structure for etyp 90 Minority when company has changed ownerpercentage to 100%? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Since E700 or etyp 90 only looks for values in companies owned less than 100%, there will be no booking on account for Change in Group Structure in this automatic journal when ownerpercentage is changed to 100%.

It is possible to get neither OB nor change booked, so that these accounts are incorrect, but the CB is correct. In menu Maintain / Configuration / Automatic journals / Control Tables - Acquisition calculations, open E700 and fill in the OB account as To account instead of blank.
