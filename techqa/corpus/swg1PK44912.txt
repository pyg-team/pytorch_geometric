ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When upgrading IBM Rational Performance Tester RPT 7.0 or 7.0.0.
   1 to 7.0.0.2 on an installation where the root cause analyzis ha
   s been setup and used with WebSphere Application Server, the upg
   rade breaks the Data Collection Infrastructure (DCI).
   A workaround consists of uninstalling 7.0 or 7.0.0.1 with the IB
   M Installation Manager then install 7.0.0.2 in one single step :
    when RPT 7.0 is presented in the packages list, select it and m
   ake sure to click check for newer versions and extensions so tha
   t 7.0.0.2 be listed to you instead.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The issue occurs when there are instrumented servers and RPT
   is upgraded. In this scenario the following configuration
   was in place:
   - WAS 6.0
   - RPT 7.0
   - RPT instrumented server (instrumented WAS)
   When the customer upgrades to RPT 7.0.0.2, the upgrade goes
   through but the DCI is damaged. The solution is to NOT allow
   upgrade if there are instrumented servers, but rather during
   the IM stop and give error/reason why and how to fix.
   In 7.0.1 this problem is caught and the situation is
   avoided.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is fixed in 7.0.1. The issue is that upgrading with
   instrumentation in place is not supported. The upgrade
   should check and stop the upgrade if this is the case.
