PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 GSKit v7.0.4.x or later is installed on a machine. You install or update IBM Rational ClearCase or IBM Rational ClearQuest with server components selected. The installation or update fails during an IBM HTTP Server operation. 

SYMPTOM
The following error might display during the post-installation configuration phase: 

Error during “post-install configure” phase:
Error executing “/tmp/common/IHS_tmp/IHS_6.1.0,0/IHS/install” operation (status=2)
See agent output log for more information



CAUSE
IBM HTTP Server is bundled with Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest. This version of IBM HTTP Server installs GSKit v7.0.3.x. When a later version of GSKit is present on a machine, the GSKit v7.0.3.x installation fails. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This issue has been fixed in version 7.1.0.2. 

 

To work around this issue, manually uninstall GSKit before installing or updating Rational ClearCase or Rational ClearQuest. 

To uninstall GSKit manually: 

Sun5 platform:

1. Determine the version of GSKit installed on the machine: 

 *  # pkginfo | grep gsk7
 * 
 * 

2. Uninstall GSKit  * # pkgrm gsk7bas
   # pkgrm gsk7bas64
 * 
 * 

3. Remove the installation location of the Tivoli Global Secure ToolKit:  * # rm -fr /opt/ibm/gsk7



Rhat-x86 platform:

1. Determine the version of GSKit installed on the machine:  * # rpm -q gsk7bas


2. Uninstall GSKit::  * # rpm -e gsk7bas-7.0-4.11


3. Remove the installation location of the Tivoli Global Secure ToolKit:  * # rm -fr /opt/ibm/gsk7
 * 


NOTE: The installed GSKit version mentioned in this technote might be different than the version installed in your environment. You use the same commands but you must modify the GSKit version in the commands to match the GSKit version installed in your environment. 

Be sure that no other IBM products installed on the system also use GSKit. If you uninstall GSKit and it is being used by another product, it will break that product's functionality.
