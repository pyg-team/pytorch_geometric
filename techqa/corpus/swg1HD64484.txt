ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PART : CATPART SIZE INCREASES
   CONSIDERABLY AFTER ACTIVATE DEACTIVATE
   PATTERN
   .
   Scenario:
   1. Open attached CATPart. It has simple pad and
   hole created on it. A small pattern (Pattern.1) is
   created using this hole. Pattern.2 created using
   Pattern1.
   2. Notice that Rectangular Pattern 1 is activated
   and Pattern.2 is Deactivated. If we file this part you
   get 444 KB for the part size.
   3. Now we will activate the Pattern.2 and refile the
   part again. You will see that number increases to
   8,916 KB because of the size of the pattern. But
   this is acceptable.
   4. Now lets De-Activate the Pattern.2 again and
   note the size returns to the original one.
   5. Now lets create a 2D view on a drafting drawing
   for the top view of this part. Start a drafting
   session and project down from 3D the top view of
   this part.
   6. Now lets re-file and save the drafting view.
   7. Now notice that the 3D part remained the same
   444 KB and the drawing came in at 310 KB.
   8. Now lets activate the Pattern.2 because we need
   to see that in the drafting view. Now save them
   both again and see what the numbers are.
   9. Ok so now the number for the 3D part has again
   stayed the same the drawing size has increased as
   expected. Now lets turn off the Pattern.2 because
   we do not need to see it any more on the solid.
   10. Notice that even though we de-activated the
   Pattern.2 the size came down but not to the level it
   was before. I guess we can understand that
   something has to be kept there to keep the 2D
   drawing in sync.
   11. So we reactivate the Pattern.2 again because
   we believe we need to update the view again. We
   do the update to the 2D drawing and then file both
   doc's again.
   12. Look what has happened. The 2D drawing has
   gone up about 5 or 6 KB. No big deal. The 3D part
   on the other hand with the Pattern.2 still active has
   gone up to 15,147 from 8,916 KB. That is a big
   difference.
   13. Now if I de-activate Pattern.2 and file the 3D
   again look what happens. The CATPart has gone up
   to 12,905 KB from 6,675 KB.
   14. Guess what with each interaction of this it
   continues upward. Something is not cleaning up
   after itself very well. Thus parts with large patterns
   that we do this with a lot will go up in size very
   quickly and for no reason. Be aware that in this
   case I made no changes to the patterns or the data
   in them. This is strictly overhead that has caused
   the numbers to go up.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  null
   ==========*===========*==========
   THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 19 GA level.
   .
   Incident Diagnosis
   CATPART SIZE INCREASES CONSIDERABLY AFTER
   ACTIVATE DEACTIVATE PATTERN
   .
   Correction Explanation
   Problem now Corrected. The size of the CATPart
   increases normally when actvating/deactivating +
   updating drawing.
   .
   Answer and By-Pass
   None.
   .
   Additional Information:
   This problem is also fixed on V5R18 SP01 level
