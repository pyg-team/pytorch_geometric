APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE CSQQCON2 EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   in the IMS MPRS which then cause any new scheduled transactions
   to fail with an MQRC of 2129.
   PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058] is applied.
   Our observation after applying the maintenance is that the
   issue is totally resolved if IMS/MQ programs have been relinked
   using the new version of CSQQSTUB.
   The use of the base V701 CSQQSTUB together with UK63858
   (PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058]) will cause CSQQCON2 to be loaded repeatedly with
   no deletes, even if explicit MQDISCs are issued by the
   application.
   .
   
   Coding an explicit MQDISC in the application does not make a
   difference.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Relink IMS/WMQ programs using the new version of
   CSQQSTUB.
   Recycle the IMS MPRS frequently to avoid the problem.

   *                      PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058]) IMS applications may receive   *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   After applying PTF UK63858 (APAR PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058]) any IMS applications
   which were compiled with the base V701 CSQQSTUB will not delete
   their copy of CSQQCON2 when the application does an MQDISC.
   If the application continues to do MQCONN then CSQQCON2 will
   have been loaded more than the allowed maximum and message
   CSV002I will be issued.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to check which version of the stub
   has been used (base version or PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058]) so that the correct
   action can be taken on whether to delete CSQQCON2 when an
   MQDISC is done.
