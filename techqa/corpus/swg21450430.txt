QUESTION
 How do I uninstall a plugin. For example, I installed the MQSeries Client plugin but I really want the MQSeries server plugin. 

ANSWER
1. Make sure everyone is out of the DataStage clients to be sure nothing is locked or the uninstall will fail. ps -ef | grep dsapi_slave to confirm.


2. First you need to figure out what the correct component name is for the uninstall (It is not necessarily the same as the plugin name that you see within DataStage)

3. Next cd to IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSComponents/bin and run dscompinst: 
For 8.1: 
./dscompinst –username <username> -password <password> –v –remove –log /tmp/removeMQ.log MQSeries 
For 8.0.1 
./dscompinst –v –remove –log /tmp/removeMQ.log MQSeries 
For 8.5 
./dscompinst -username <isadmin> -password <isadminPassword> -locale <en_US> -remove –log /tmp/removeMQ.log mqseries.jar|mqclient.jar 
For 8.7 
./dscompinst -username <isadmin> -password <isadminPassword> -locale <en_US> -remove –log /tmp/removeMQ.log MQSeries 

4. This will remove the plugin out of all projects and it will put the plugin components, including its jar file, into a directory called IBM/InformationServer/Server/StagingArea/MothBalled 

5. The plugin is now removed. 

6. If you want to reinstall a previously uninstalled plugin, you can use the jar file that gets put in the MothBalled directory. 

7. This works the same way on windows
