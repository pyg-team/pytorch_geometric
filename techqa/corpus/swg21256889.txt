QUESTION
 How can you open a visualized Rational® Application Developer for WebSphere® Software diagram (.dnx) file in IBM® Rational Software Modeler? 

CAUSE
Rational Software Modeler (RSM) does not have the visualize capability, so you cannot open a .dnx file directly in RSM.

ANSWER
Below are the steps you will need to perform: 

 

 1. Install Rational Software Architect (RSA) or Rational System Developer (RSD) on a computer 
    
    Note: You can install the trial version of RSA or RSD by getting either from the Trials and demos site: http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/brand.jsp?b=Rational [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/brand.jsp?b=Rational]
    
 2. Bring the Rational Application Developer project into RSA or RSD
    
 3. Perform a Harvest on the code by following technote 1237770: How to harvest Java code into Rational Software Architect [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2044&uid=swg21237770] 
    
 4. Bringing the .emx from RSA or RSD, launch RSM; go to File > Import > File System and import the .emx file.
