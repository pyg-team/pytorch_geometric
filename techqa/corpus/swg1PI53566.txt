APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The On Demand Router (ODR) has a memory leak related to
   HttpRouteAction objects such that when the system is under load
   and there are configuration changes such as uninstalling and
   installing applications it is possible that multiple, redundant
   HttpRouteAction objects can be created with registered
   listeners for ODC tree changes but never removed.  This will
   eventually fill up the available heap space and cause an Out Of
   Memory issue on the ODR.  Restarting the ODR will correct the
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the ODR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Intelligent Management using the     *
   *                  java On Demand Router (ODR).                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An Out Of Memory error can be seen on   *
   *                      the On Demand Router because            *
   *                      HttpRouteAction objects can             *
   *                      accumulate.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   There is a code bug where HttpRouteAction objects can
   accumulate because they are not freed. This is particularly
   noticeable when there are routing rules present, many
   applications installed, and multiple configuration changes
   happening on the system (such as installing or removing
   applications). Over time this can cause exhaustion of the
   available heap and an Out Of Memory error for the On Demand
   Router.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The area of code was corrected to release the HttpRouteAction
   objects. This fix supercedes PI51978 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI51978].
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.9.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
