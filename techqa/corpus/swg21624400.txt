Title: IBM DataStage 9.1 Client install to supported platform fails the prerequisite check - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have been able to install the server without any issue. But when I attempt to install the Client side, the pre-requisite checker of the installation program indicates
"Ensure the current platform is a supported platform"


CAUSE
the wrong bundle file was copied into the is-client install folder 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The install log indicates
FAILED: Ensure the current platform is a supported platform.
Details:
FAILED: Ensure the current platform is a supported platform.
Resolution: The current platform is a 64-bit platform and your installation image is a 32-bit image. Obtain the proper 64-bit installation image and try again.



This problem occurs when installing the DataStage client using the DataStage server bundle specification file instead of the client bundle specification file.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download and unpack the correct client bundle specification file, InfoSvr_V9.1_Client_Bundle_Spec_File into the installation directory. 

You can obtain the correct client bundle file for Information Server 9.1 by downloading the package from Passport Advantage, for example: 
IBM InfoSphere Information Server v9.1 Client Bundle Spec File Windows Multilingual ( CIFI1ML )
