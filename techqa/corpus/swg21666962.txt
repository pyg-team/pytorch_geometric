PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading and migrating FileNet Content Engine (CE) and Content Search Engine (CSE) 4.5.1 to CE and Content Search Services (CSS) 5.1 onto another system unable to perform content based search. Legacy Content Search Engine (LCSE) to CSS migration initiated but it stopped migrating to CSS. 

SYMPTOM
 

 * Unable to change the object store - General Tab configuration to Search Type of Content Search Services. It default to LCSE search. 
 * The migration index job does not reflect as Terminated status. It still shows as Processing status. 
 * Error seem in the p8_server_error.log:

 * YYYY-02-22T00:51:58.991Z 1E591E59 CBR FNRCE0000E - ERROR Updating indexing request after failure. Object store: Noble, targetId: {E8B40D01-BDE0-490E-A154-0629FCEFD8C4}, elem seq#: 0, operation: Create indexationId: {BC7177BA-5152-4A28-B89B-822E2FBC0BB5}, seqnumIdentity: 961084, note: File not accessible to CE server (BaseContentArea.getFilenames returned status of -1) 

 * Actual physical files are not in the file store. 


CAUSE
The file system and the database back up wasn't in sync therefore causing document metadata already created in the database but the files are not in the file store.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure the P8 4.5.1 system backup of the database and file stores are backup and restored following the procedure in the IBM Knowledge Center for P8 4.5.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_4.5.1/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/backup_restore/_start_here_backup.htm?lang=en] before upgrading the software. After LCSE to CSS migration is completed, you will see the Migration job in the FileNet Enterprise Manager - Index Job Management reflect as Terminated status. The Object Store - General properties - Search Type field will no longer be gray out with the option to switch between CSS and LCSE.
