APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Information Server 11.3 is now shipping with Liberty profile.
   The productInfo version shows 8.5.5.1 running on Suse Linux
   11.3. Both tivoli and AD filters are not working.
   
   There are no error with these filters, you simply get back all
   my users and all your groups when requesting a user/group list
   from your application. Adding the same filters to WebSphere
   Application Server Network Deployment edition standalone LDAP
   they behave correctly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Liberty Profile- Virtual Member      *
   *                  Manager (VMM)                               *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Provide a way to configure an LDAP      *
   *                      entity type specific search filter,     *
   *                      search Base and an Object class         *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Prior to this fix, a Liberty profile user working with the LDAP
   registry did not have a way to configure an LDAP entity type
   specific search filter, search Base and an Object class. These
   were critical in order to narrow down the LDAP query to specific
   records. With this fix, it is possible to specify those
   attributes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will provide an extra configuration of LDAP entity type
   in LDAP registry by which user will be able to define new set of
   rules like search filter, search Base and an Object class.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 8.5.5.6.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
