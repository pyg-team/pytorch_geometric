PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While trying to populate a table widget in the Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) with data from TDI, selecting the TDI dataset immediately displays this error: "Can not deserialize instance of java.util.ArrayList out of START_OBJECT" 

SYMPTOM
When trying to populate a table widget with data from TDI, selecting the TDI dataset 
immediately displays this error: 
Can not deserialize instance of java.util.ArrayList out of START_OBJECT token at [Source: org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser$Input@6e526e52; line: 8, column: 10]


CAUSE
The com.ibm.di.api.bind.jar and com.ibm.di.api.rest.jar files in the TDI installation are old and need replaced by copies from the DASH install.

ENVIRONMENT
JazzSM/DASH installed with TDI

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When trying to populate a DASH widget with TDI data, the follow error is issues to STDOUT and also in the <JazzSM_HOME>profile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log:


Can not deserialize instance of java.util.ArrayList out of START_OBJECT token at [Source: org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser$Input@6e526e52; line: 8, column: 10]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In DASH if you see a TDI connection in Settings -> Connection 

then the DASH piece for TDI is installed and running. After you install TDI 7.1.1 there are two file updates you need to make in the TDI installation. The files are installed into DASH, where you need to copy them as follows: 

1) Move com.ibm.di.api.bind.jar and com.ibm.di.api.rest.jar from your TDI installation's osgi/plugins folder to a backup folder, in case you have to revert. 

2) Copy the newer versions of the two jar files from step 1 from <JazzSM_HOME>/ui/installableApps into the TDI installation's osgi/plugins folder and restart the TDI server.
