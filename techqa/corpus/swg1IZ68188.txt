APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Action taken:
   
   Spoken to EMA SME after attempting reproduction to no avail(
   complex install and finacial interface involved).
   Did a further deep analysis of the log files and looks to be a
   bug indeed drawing from expereince.
   
   Created APAR
   
   
   Exception "BMXAA4146E - Not a valid GLaccount." thrown after GL
   acounts removed in LabRep.
   
   
   Long description:
   
   This error message seems to be thrown when the gl account is set
   on the invoice
   cost while creating invoice lines.
   From the UI it will be thrown as soon as the value is set
   confirming what invoice line/invoice cost it is complaining
   about then and there.
   Through the interface all the invoice lines values are set and
   then delayed validation is done and it throws this message.
   This is a basic validation and is common to all the objects
   hence this generic message.
   There should be a more detailed message.
   
   received feedback from Dev to submit this APAR for it,so to get
   a fix for this      that requires a message change which will
   not be possible in 7.1.1.5 but
   will have to be done in the next patch release.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1)Create an invoice with 17 lines.
   2)Export the invoice to a flat file using IF.
   3)Edit the flat file,
   4)select the GL Account on the third line,
   5)edit the last segment of the GL account (or modify a number so
   the GL will no
   longer be valid).
   6)Import the flat file using IF.
   7)Notice:The import will fail -> An error message will be send
   to the administrator defined in the mxe.int.admintoemail
   N.B!: The error message doesn't specify the line number or the
   GL account
   that is causing the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As for the client right now, the work around is to turn the
   
   integration debug logger on which will print out a stack trace
   of the
   error at the point where an invalid value GL value is set to
   identy the gl account and rectify accordingly.
   Alternatively the client will have to upgrade to 7.1.1.6 in
   where this fix will be incorporated.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <This was already addressed in REL 7.1.1.6 for a different apar
   09-13998. The message is OK if you use Invoice application as
   you see the invoice number and line number right in front of
   you. In MEA import transactions, the messaage was not adequate.
   A new message was created for the MEA transaction that will be
   like the following example:
   
   6000-200-XXX  {0} is not a valid GL account on Invoice 1000 ine
   5. Either the required components are not filled or the
   component values are not valid.>
   
   
   
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
