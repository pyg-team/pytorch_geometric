PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 These are the steps that must be taken to trace CICS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These are the steps that must be taken to trace CICS: 

1. Ensure the trace files are defined in the AUXTRCCTL parameter of the SIT (use DSPCICSSIT command).

Specially the values:

Auxiliary trace A object . . . trace_A_file_name
Library . . . . . . . . . . lib
Auxiliary trace B object . . . trace_B_file_name
Library . . . . . . . . . . lib

Use the CHGCICSSIT command to change the values, if needed. 2. Recycle the control region if those values were added using CHGCICSSIT. 3. Open an interactive CICS shell session (STRCICSUSR command), and enter the following transactions to start both Internal/Auxiliary Trace:

CEMT SET INT STA
CEMT SET AUX STA 4. Reproduce the problem. 5. Once done, turn the trace off with the following:

CEMT SET INT STO
CEMT SET AUX STO 6. Use the PRTCICSTRC command to spool the trace information. Indicate the same file names used in Step 1.
