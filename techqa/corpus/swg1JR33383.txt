PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   DS 7.5.1A, Windows 2003, MS OLEDB Stage
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Customer states:
   
   DataStage Server = H78APWA03, this hosts all DataStage projects
   
   
   
   SQL Servers:
   
   
   
   H78SQLW02 = this is the production sql server (MS SQL 2005) and
   
   production jobs work against this from the PROD project (thank
   goodness
   or we would be completely dead)
   
   
   
   H78QAWA01 = this is the QA SQL server MS SQL 2005. Our
   DataStage
   project QA is supposed to use this server. I can connect to it
   from
   command line on H78APWA03 fine only when in DataStage can I no
   longer
   connect
   
   
   
   I set up a test project QA2 which is where I ran the traced jobs
   trying
   to connect to H78QAWA01, no good. Yet, if I want to import a
   table
   structure from the QA SQL server I can, no problem using the
   same
   connection!
   
   
   
   In all cases I am using the same authentication.
   
   
   It seems to me that there is a problem with the SQL Server on
   their H78QAWA01 SQL Server machine. Had them check the MDAC
   version and on both the good and bad sql server its Windows 2003
   MDAC 2.8.
   
   I imported and ran the customers job fine on our support servers
   running SQL Server 2005. I have uploaded all the customers info
   to the CRM server.
   
   You'll note that both the jobs PRODDSXEXport.dsx.zip and
   QA2DSXEXport.dsx.zip are the same, the prod job runs fine (see
   log), the QA job get a vague error that I could not find any
   info on in our support db's or google.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It was stated that: there are no columns definition picked up
   by DSCGetFirstColumn(). Take patch and readme files from patches
   location. This issue is resolved with the latest maintenance
   patch.
