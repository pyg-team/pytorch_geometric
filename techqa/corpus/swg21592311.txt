The use Restrict Fields can be used to enhance efficiency off the configuration by reducing the "weight" of the data captured per event to the minimum required.

It can also be used to avoid unwanted/dangerous fields.

There is a minimum set of fields required as default by the EventReader - see the TechNote "OMNIbusEventReader required fields" [link below].

Also there are the fields required by the Deviant Fields checking process - see the TechNotes "Default Deviant Fields in OMNIbusEventReader" and "Deviant Field checking in EventReaders" [links below].

And one has to ensure that the EventReader also acquires all the fields used in the Policy/ies (lookups, assessments and updates) that the EventReader launches.
