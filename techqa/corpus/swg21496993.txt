QUESTION
 What is the exact data acquired by the ILMT Agent and from VM Manager? 

ANSWER
1. What data is acquired from Agent

Generally from the agent the below data is acquired: 
* hostname 
* ip_address
* agent id
* processor type of the node (if it is possible to retrieve it from the system)
* logical processor cores count on the partition
* processors cores count on the node (if possible) 
* serial number of the machine (for bare metal) and/or 
* UUID of the virtual machine etc. 

In order to check the exact data that the agent is generating and sending to the server you can check the content of the <agent_dir>/scanner/tlm_hw_output.gz (output from the hardware scan) and <agent_dir>/scanner/tlm_local_sw_output.gz (output from the software scan) files. 


2. What data is acquired from VM Manager. 

Generally in VIRT schema the RAW data retrieved from VM Manager (ESX server / vCenter) are kept. We are retrieving this data using the VMWare Web Services SDK (a Java API version of it). Next the data from the VIRT schema is being processed and stored in different tables in ADM schema (like ADM.NODE or ADM.MEASURE).

Data about the virtual machines (VIRT.GUEST) like: 
* UUID of the VM (EXT_ID) 
* parent ID (id of the host or cluster) 
* number of the logical processor cores assigned to the virtual machines (CPU_NUMBER) 

Data about host/servers (VIRT.HOST): 
* UUID of the server (EXT_ID) - VirtualMachine.config.uuid (from VMWare API)
* parent ID (cluster or VM Manager) 
* hardware vendor 
* hardware model 
* processor vendor 
* processor name / description 
* number of physical processors on the host 
* number of cores 
* connection state (CONNECTED - 0, DISCONNECTED - 1, NOT_RESPONDING - 2) - only the connected once are used to the following processing - HostSystem.runtime.connectionState (from VMWare API) 


Data about the clusters (Virt.CLUSTER): 
* cluster name 
* parent ID (id of the VM Manager) 


Not all data which was retrieved from VM Manager is used for calculation or building the virtual topology - some of the data are being retrieved only to check the accuracy of the data. Additionally the data in the VIRT schema is not stored permanently - it is being rewritten during each VM Manager connection task (by default each 30 minutes). Only the data in ADM schema are 'permanent' and used for PVU calculations.
