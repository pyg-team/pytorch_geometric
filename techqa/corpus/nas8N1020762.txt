PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Secure Shell (SSH) configuration file behavior on the IBM i. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Modifications to the client (ssh_config) and server (sshd_config) configuration files in the UserData path are replicated to the corresponding configuration files in the ProdData path and vice versa. 
 * The secure shell daemon (SSHD) uses the directives/keywords in the server configuration file (sshd_config) in the UserData path to process inbound ssh, sftp, & scp connections to the IBM i. 
 * SSH, SFTP, & SCP connections initiated from the IBM i use the directives/keywords in the client configuration file (ssh_config) in the ProdData to setup the environment for outbound connections. 
 * A new version of licensed product 5733SC1 (IBM Portable Utilities) is created for each IBM i release. 
 * The client and server configuration files in the ProdData path are deleted and replaced with new configuration files each time the 5733SC1 licensed product is installed. 
 * The client and server configuration files in the UserData directory are retained when the the 5733SC1 licensed product is removed/deleted from the system. However, new configuration files are added when a new version of the 5733SC1 licensed product is installed. The system uses the latest or most recent configuration files when processing inbound or outbound ssh connections. 
 * Since the IFS files in the UserData path are intended to be modified by users of the system, IBM's recommendation is to make all ssh configuration changes to the files in the UserData path. These configuration changes will be replicated to the corresponding configuration files in the ProdData path.
