QUESTION
 How do I minimize round trips to the IBM FileNet Content Engine (CE) server when retrieving large files using IBM FileNet Content Engine Web Services (CEWS) with Inline SOAP? 

ANSWER
Increase the value for Inline Content Retrieval Limit by doing the following: 

 -Expand Sites in IBM FileNet Enterprise Manger (FEM). 

- Expand Virtual Servers, expand the node. 

- Right click the server and select Properties. 

- Select the Content tab. 

- Select the Override Inherited Settings option, if necessary 

 

By default this value is set at 1MB, the maximum value is 10MB. The current documentation is incorrect by stating that the maximum value is 1MB. A documentation defect has been filed. 

Note: Increasing this value will have an impact on the JVM of the Content Engine, as more memory is consumed when a large document is being retrieved through the inline SOAP protocol. Please refer to the Performance and Tuning guide for more information on tuning JVM.
