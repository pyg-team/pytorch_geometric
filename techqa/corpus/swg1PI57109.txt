   ****************************************************************
   In a WebSphere Liberty install, when a catalog server stops to
   complete network brownout recovery, the messages logged during
   shutdown do not match the actions taken. If a catalog server
   promotes during a brownout and must stop after the brownout
   resolves (duplicate primary catalog servers), the WebSphere
   eXtreme Scale portion of the Liberty servers stops. The Liberty
   JVM must be restarted to restart the catalog server.
   In a WebSphere Application Server install in the same scenario,
   the catalog server does not correctly shutdown the WebSphere
   eXtreme Scale portion of the application server. The catalog
   servers can continue to run with dual primary catalog servers in
   the domain.
   Example logging for the Liberty case:
   [12/8/15 8:59:30:863 GMT] 0000005f
   s.objectgrid.replication.CommonReplicationGroupMemberService I
   CWOBJ1227I: The server was disconnected from the primary catalog
   server, which will be restarted to reconnect.
   com.ibm.ws.objectgrid.server.impl.ServerImpl                 I
   CWOBJ2510I: Stopping ObjectGrid server catalog1.
   com.ibm.ws.objectgrid.server.container.ObjectGridContainerImpl I
   CWOBJ1138I: The catalog0_C-0 container received a terminate
   request. The reason code is 3.
   com.ibm.ws.xs.process.utils.Restart                          E
   CWOBJ1225E: The JVM did not restart.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The logging was corrected in Liberty installs. The WXS component
   correctly shuts down in WebSphere Application Server brownout
   recovery scenarios.
