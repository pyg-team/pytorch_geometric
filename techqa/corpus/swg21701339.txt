Text:
life cycle; end of support PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

ABSTRACT
 There is some confusion around the announcement for EOS on Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1 Entry server. This technote will clarify what is supported and what is not supported. 

CONTENT
IBM announced the End of Support (EOS) of Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1 Entry along with other Sametime products. This can be found in the following announcement letter: 

"Software withdrawal and discontinuance: IBM Sametime and IBM Sametime Unified Telephony V8.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS913-174]" 

That EOS applies only to customers who are not using Domino entitlement for Sametime Entry (Limited Use). If a customer is using Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1 Entry as part of their Domino entitlement, then it is fully supported until that release of Domino is EOS. 

The following shows which Sametime Entry release is associated with each Domino release and its earliest possible end of life dates:
