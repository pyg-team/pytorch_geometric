APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Applications written using the EZASMI macro or ezasoket call
   interface may suffer abend906 rc=08 loading ezasok03. During
   execution of socket subtask processing with ezasmi or ezasoket
   a load of module ezasok03 is done from macro ezasmi. The
   load of ezasok03, with no corresponding delete, causes the
   cde use count for ezasok03 to increment until it reaches the
   max of 32,767(x'7fff').

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the eNetwork Communications     *
   *                 Server for OS/390 Release 5 IP; CICS and     *
   *                 extended socket users.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CSV002I request for module EZASOH03     *
   *                      exceed maximum use count followed by    *
   *                      CSV028I ABEND 906-08 jobname.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the EZASMI macro interface is invoked for the first time,
   it loads EZASOH03. However, it never issues a corresponding
   delete. The reported error will occur should the CDE use count
   reach 32k.
   
   This APAR is the equivalent of PQ08338 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1PQ08338] reported at V3R1 of
   TCP/IP for MVS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  EZASMI has been amended so that a delete for EZASOH03 is issued
   when the application issues a TERMAPI.
