QUESTION
 I want to know if there is a query I can run to find out how many of each type of interaction are being done in a day or hour on my IBM MDM Standard Edition system. 

ANSWER
The mpi_audhead table tracks when interactions are performed and the mpi_ixnhead table stores what are the types of interactions.

So if you wanted to get a count of the number of times each interaction is performed on August 3rd, 2016 you could use the following query:
select ah.ixnrecno, ih.ixncode, COUNT(*) from mpi_audhead ah, mpi_ixnhead ih 
where ih.ixnrecno = ah.ixnrecno
and ah.audctime >= '2016-08-03 00:00:00:000' and ah.audctime < '2016-08-04 00:00:00:000'
GROUP by ah.ixnrecno, ih.ixncode;

Note that the audctime values and format may be different depending on the format of dates and times for your specific database.
