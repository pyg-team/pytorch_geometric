LOCAL FIX
 *  Upgrade AIX to at least 6.1 TL4 SP6 or 6.1 TL5 and create a new
   core file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An incompatible change in the AIX dump format meant jextract
   cannot correctly process core files from certain AIX levels.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR8
   1.4.2 SR13 FP7 (AIX PowerPC 64-bit)
   5.0.0 SR12
   .
   The JVM has been updated to work around the problem in AIX, so
   core files from all AIX levels can be processed by jextract.
   Separately, AIX has been fixed under APARs IZ74700 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ74700] and IZ70805 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ70805].
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20100122 or later
