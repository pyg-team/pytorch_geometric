Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Flex System Manager (FSM) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL that is embedded in the FSM. This bulletin addresses these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the \"error state\" mechanism when directly calling SSL_read() or SSL_write() for an SSL object after receiving a fatal error. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the decryption or encryption process and perform unauthorized actions. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077] for the current score
