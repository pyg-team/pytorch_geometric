Title: IBM "The cell or chart you are trying to change is protected..." after creating new free form - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer creates a new free form has been set up. User amends a new account and updates the system via "Maintain - Account Structure - Movement Accounts - Generate". User updates the form via "Maintain - Form Structure - Define - DEFI".

User tries to use the form, but receives an error. 

User tries to 'update' the form, but since it has been set up a "free" form, the user does not have the 
'update button' available (which is there for standard forms only). 

SYMPTOM
The cell or chart you are trying to change is protected and therefore read-only.


CAUSE
There are many potential causes for the same/similar errors. 

 * TIP: For more examples, see separate IBM Technote #1666512.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is that the customer has forgotten to optimise the database after making structure changes.  * Optimising the database is a required step after making many changes to the Controller system's structures.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform a database optimise. 

 
Steps:
1. Obtain a short period of downtime (no users on the system)
2. Click "Maintain - Database - Optimise"
3. Tick/select all available options
4. Click 'Run'.
