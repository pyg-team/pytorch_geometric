QUESTION
 Which ciphers are being used by the Bigfix components during communications when the Enhanced Security Mode is enabled? 

ANSWER

When enhanced security is enabled, the SHA256 is used, so all ciphers compatible to SHA256 survive. 
.
These are the chipers supported by BigFix:

AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLSv1.2 
AES256-SHA256 TLSv1.2 
AES256-SHA TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 
CAMELLIA256-SHA TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 
AES128-GCM-SHA256 TLSv1.2 
AES128-SHA256 TLSv1.2 
AES128-SHA TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 
CAMELLIA128-SHA TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 
DES-CBC3-SHA TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 

The order of precedence depends on OpenSSL layer.
