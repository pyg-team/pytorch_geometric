Text:
side-by-side configuration error; application event log; SPSS Statistics 20 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM SPSS Statistics on a Windows Vista or later operating system may presents at least one of the following error messages on startup:

Message 1: 
The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more detail.

Message 2:
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0150004).

The SPSS Statistics software will not start. 

CAUSE
The behaviors are the result of a incorrect and/or missing the C++ Runtime component for your type of system. (x86 or x64). SPSS Statistics ships with the required version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable libraries needed, but they were unable to be installed. The most likely cause is not having the correct write file permissions, the installation did not complete, or the installation was terminated early. 

ENVIRONMENT
Windows Operating Systems: Windows Vista or later.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following procedure requires administrator privileges/credentials to complete.


1) Open Windows Explorer. 

2) Navigate to the directory corresponding to your software products version (vernum). 
Replace '<vernum> with the version number of your product (i.e. 20, 21, 22, 23, etc). The default directory for version 24 is:

C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24

3) Open the 'VC9' folder.

4) In the folder will be an executable file (ending in .exe) called either vcredist_x86.exe or vcredist_x64.exe, depending on the version of SPSS Statistics installed. 

*32-bit version of Statistics installed on 64-bit Windows operating system* 
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\<vernum>\VC9\vcredist_x86.exe

*32-bit version of Statistics is installed on a 32-bit Windows operating system*
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\<vernum>\VC9\vcredist_x86.exe

*64-bit version of Statistics is installed on a 64-bit Windows operating system*
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\<vernum>\VC9\vcredist_x64.exe

Run this file as Administrator by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Run as administrator'. If 'Run as administrator' is grayed out or you do not have the administrator password when asked, please have local IT department complete the installation or have them grant you the correct administrator privileges. 

5) The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable libraries will now begin to install. Installation may take a few minutes. .

6) Once the installation is complete, close all open windows and launch the Statistics software. The Statistics software should now start normally without the 'side-by-side' error message.
