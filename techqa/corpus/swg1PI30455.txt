APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z (RDz) debugger experiences
   delays when stepping through breakpoints after a
   disconnect/reconnect to a debug session.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Instead of the disconnect, terminate from the debug session OR
   disable automonitor at the beginning of the debug session, by
   running the following command from the Debug Console view: SET
   AUTOMONITOR OFF
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Debug Tool's Automonitor function caused monitors to be set but
   not cleaned up during an engine disconnect, which could lead to
   a build up of monitors and a slow down in debugger performance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The monitors set by automonitor are cleaned up on an engine
   disconnect.
