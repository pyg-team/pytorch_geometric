PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have configured DB2 Document Manager Print/Plot service with a network printer. When I select and submit multiple documents to print using DB2 Document Manager desktop, not all documents are getting printed but only some. 

SYMPTOM
You can only print single document at a time but not multiple documents.


CAUSE
If you have configured the network shared printer with "Standard TCP/IP" and the printer is not connected directly to the DB2 Document Manager server , you will see this behavior with Print/Plot Service.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use following one of the option to resolve the issue.




 * Install and configure the printer directly to DB2 Document Manager Server and use "Local Port" for the printer settings. 
 * Install and configure DB2 Document Manager Print/Plot service on the network printer server.
