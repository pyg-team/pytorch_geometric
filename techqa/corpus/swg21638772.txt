Title: IBM Receiving error message when saving an SPSS data file to a network drive - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I sometimes have problems to save a IBM SPSS Statistics data file (*.sav) to a network drive.
For example I get the below messages:

>Error. Command name: SAVE 
>Error opening a SPSS Statistics data file: \\network folder\user1\My Documents\SPSS files\test.sav: Permission denied (DATA1201) 
>Execution of this command stops. 

>Error # 1407 
>Error when writing the dictionary to a new data file. 

>Warning # 5322. Command name: SAVE 
>The attempt to save the data file has failed because the disk is full, an I/O 
>error has occurred, the variable dictionary is invalid, or the task was 
>interrupted. IF SAVING OVER AN EXISTING FILE, THAT FILE HAS BEEN LOST. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There can be various reasons for save problems to a network drive: 

First make sure that the user who wants to save to a particular network drive have write and execute permissions on that particular network folder.

If the problem occur occasionally although the permission were granted save the file to a local drive and then try again to save to the network drive after a short wait time. Sometimes the save issue is caused by network performance delay when there is a lot of traffic.

Another possible reason for a save issue on a network drive can be caused by other application e.g. Anti-Virus software or firewalls. As a workaround stop these programs for a short time frame and try to save to the network again to see if the other software is causing the problem.

Lastly, make sure your file paths are short and the do not contain special characters. We suggest no more than 3 directories deep and do not use apostrophes or other special characters in the folder/file names. 

However, an enhancement request for receiving a more detailed error message when saving an SPSS data file to a network drive was submitted to IBM SPSS Development.
