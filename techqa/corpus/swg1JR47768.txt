APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customers running Information Server in a Clustered WebSphere
   Environment run into several errors while running the Patch
   Installer.  The error is caused by timeout issues during a
   ripplestart
   
   In the System Out logs we see messages like the following
   NodeAgent     A   ADML0000I: The server initialization is
   complete. The process ID is: 16251, server name is:
   ServerNode01_01
   AdminHelper   A   ADMN1000I: An attempt is made to launch
   ServerNode01_02 on node  ServerNode01. (User ID =
   ASBRealm/wsinfosphere)
   
    Thread "SoapConnectorThreadPool : 0" (00000083) has been
   active for 665451 milliseconds and may be hung.
   
   in the deployment manager logs we may see
   [8/6/13 17:05:58:396 UTC] 00000109 Cluster       E   WWLM0058E:
   Cluster member ServerNode01_04 did not start properly.
   javax.management.JMRuntimeException: ADMN0034E: The service is
   unable to obtain a valid administrative client to connect
   process "ServerNode01" from process "dmgr", because of
   exception:
   com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.ConnectorException:
   ADMC0009E: The system failed to make the SOAP RPC call: invoke
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer has to reduce the number of running app servers to
   apply a patch or a fixpack.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Patch install runs forever in a large clustered environment if
   it takes more than 30 minutes to restart the cluster (each
   cluster node is sequentially stopped and started). The
   Deployment manager monitoring the startup, times out after 30
   minutes, and never indicates that the cluster finally started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In JR46053 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR46053] to start the cluster we stop and start each cluster
   member sequentially. This can take a long time to go through all
    nodes, the 30 minute dmgr timeout could occur, and the patch
   install fails. The fix was to just do a start, and not use
   ripplestart.
