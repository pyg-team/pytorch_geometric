Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The MD5 “SLOTH” vulnerability on TLS 1.2 affects IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575] 

DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables MD5 signature hash by default. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 signature hash and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None, fix must be applied.
