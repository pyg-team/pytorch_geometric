Title: IBM Security Bulletin: GSKit Sweet32: Birthday attacks in IBM Content Collector for Microsoft SharePoint - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
