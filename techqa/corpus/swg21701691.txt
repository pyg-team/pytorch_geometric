PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 PeopleSoft domain & process scheduler agent - workspaces no longer show data following agent restart. 

SYMPTOM
Customer recently installed both the PeopleSoft domain (p8) & Process scheduler agent (P9) on to a Redhat Linux server. It has been working fine for a few weeks. After restarting the p8 agent, all of the Custom Objects in the SCH Performance Object Status workspace are returning the error OBJECT NOT FOUND and all the PeopleSoft Process Scheduler and Domain workspaces are not being populated except for the Availability workspace where many of the process show down, when in reality the processes are actually running. This was verified with a ps ef | grep processname.


Note that after restarting p8 the other p9 agent workspaces were working fine. Then the same occurred in p9 agent after restarting it.


CAUSE
When the agents were installed, the /IBM/ITM directory was owned by the root user.

Since the OS agent also needs to be installed, it was assumed the PeopleSoft agents would required the same authority.


ENVIRONMENT
Redhat Linux;2.6.32-358.el6.x86_64
Installer Lvl: 06.30.02.00
p8 Monitoring Agent for PeopleSoft Domain 07.11.00.01, Comp ID 5724V09PS 
p9 Monitoring Agent for PeopleSoft Process Scheduler 07.11.00.00



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Determine the owner and group for the directory */IBM/ITM/

Run a PDCollect and check the dir.info file. Look at the permissions assigned to */IBM/ITM/ 


OR 


Run the following command from the directory */IBM/ITM 
ls -la 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ITM directory needs to be owned by a valid Siebel user. 

When the system is restarted the OS agent will default to the root user. The root account will be able to start the PeopleSoft agents and the OS agent. 

By making the owner of the ITM directory a valid Siebel user account the PeopleSoft agents can access files they could not when the directory was owned by root.
