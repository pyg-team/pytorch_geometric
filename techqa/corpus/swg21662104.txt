For DXL attribute values stored only in a baseline you can copy the basline which creates a new module that can be opened exclusively. An alternative is to provide support the attribute definition file from the baseline.Discuss with support how to locate the attribute definition file, attrs.dtc, in the baseline subdirectory of the module and send it to support who will decrypt the file and provide you a text copy of the contents.
