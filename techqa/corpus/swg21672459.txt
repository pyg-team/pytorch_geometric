ABSTRACT
 Recent Java updates have caused various problems related to the TEP Client <--> TEPS connection. 

CONTENT
Recent Java updates, first identified in Oracle Java 7 update 45 / Java 6 update 65 and IBM Java 7 SR 6 / Java 6 SR 15 have caused connection problems when logging into the TEPS via the TEP Browser / Java Web Start clients. This document will be a living document for current information specific to the Java version installed for the TEP Client.

The client may stop loading prior to the Tivoli Portal logon screen appearing. 
Problem observed with Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11. 
Work around is to restart the Tivoli portal browser client. 
Java Web Start client is not affected. Oracle Java 7 update 101 Workspaces containing Graphics Views fail to render properly. The following exception appears in the TEP Client trace:

Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-2" 
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError 
at ilog.views.swing.IlvJScrollManagerView.adjustScrollBars(Unknown Source) 
at ilog.views.swing.IlvJScrollManagerView.addNotify(Unknown Source) 

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Minor revision must be 0 <= 101 < 100

The problem occurs with both TEP Java Web Start Client and TEP Browser Client.

The exception only happens with the 64-bit Oracle Java 7 u101, The 32-bit JRE is not affected.

Workaround: Add the following line to the tep.jnlpt file (between the "Custom parameters" opening and closing lines): 
<property name="jnlp.java.version" value="1.7.0_99"/>

And reconfigure the browser (cw) component:
Unix: 
/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A cw 
Windows:
bring up MTEMS
right click "Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser "
select reconfigure (Java 8 officially supported in ITM630FP5 and above)

Oracle Java 8 update 31 Issue 1: Using Java 8 64-bit with Internet Explorer version 11 fails with the message:

"This content cannot be displayed in a frame
To help protect the security of information you enter into this website, the publisher of this content does not allow it to be displayed in a frame."

Cause: IE 11 does not support 64-bit plugin processes. 

Workaround: install the Java 8 32-bit runtime or use the Java Web Start client. 

Issue 2: Java 8 fails with Firefox. The client does not fully initialize, giving a blank screen. 

Cause: This is a bug in the java plugin. Oracle has stated the fix will be included in their upcoming release of Java 8 update 60, current target date August 2015. 

Workaround: Use Internet Explorer, or use the Web Start client. (Java 8 officially supported in ITM630FP5 and above)

Oracle Java 8 update 101 Workspaces containing Graphics Views fail to render properly. The following exception appears in the TEP Client trace:

Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-2" 
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError 
at ilog.views.swing.IlvJScrollManagerView.adjustScrollBars(Unknown Source)

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Minor revision must be 0 <= 101 < 100

The problem occurs with both TEP Java Web Start Client and TEP Browser Client.

The exception only happens with the 64-bit Oracle Java 8 u101, The 32-bit JRE is not affected.

Windows:
bring up MTEMS
right click "Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser "
select reconfigure Oracle Java 8 update 131 When starting the TEP client with this version (or newer) of Java, the following error may be seen:

Error: Unsigned application requesting unrestricted access to the system
The following resource is signed with a weak signature algorithm MD5withRSA and is treated as unsigned: http://TEPS_server:15200/classes/jar-file.jar [http://server:15200/classes/jar-file.jar] 

The name of the jar file (jar-file.jar above) will vary. 

Oracle JRE will no longer trust MD5-signed code by default as of Java 8 update 131. 

We have updated our jar signer program to use SHA-1.

Workaround: Please send in your jar files so that they can be re-signed with the new signer program. Use this tech note for guidance:

Workaround: This issue is due to a known bug in Oracle Java 8 JRE version 141 and not with a certain ITM jar file. Oracle has provided a fix in Oracle JRE 1.8.0_144. The workaround for this issue is to download and install Oracle Java 8 update 144. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672459&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672459&amp;aid=1]
