APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description :
   
    TEMA loops on OOM conditions, thus producing heapdumps
    generated in loop what enventually cause system crash. This is
    known issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - As workaround, "IBM_HEAPDUMP=TRUE" env can be used for TEMA
   process which will suppress heapdump generation on OOM (and thus
   disk space exhausted).
   Here are steps:
   1) Stop TEMA
   2) Edit $ITMHOME/conifg/yn.ini  file
   3) Add "IBM_HEAPDUMP=TRUE" line (at any place in the file, e.g.
   at the
   end);
   4) Restart TEMA - it should not generate heapdumps on OOM
   anymore
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Prevent heapdumps in Out Of Memory coneditions
