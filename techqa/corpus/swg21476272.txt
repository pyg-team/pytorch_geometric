Title: IBM Error VLS0016 : Invalid Characters when licensing Sentinel 8 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm installing my SPSS product's network license on Sentinel 8. I run "spssactivator <authcode>", and I receive the following error:

"Error (VLS0016): <license code>: Invalid Characters - <license code>". When I attempt to run echoid.exe to get a lock code, I receive the following message:

"Locking Code 1: 0-0"

How can I license Sentinel and get my network license products running? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It appears that the machine cannot license using the criterion specified in echoid.dat. At this point, the workaround is to change echoid.dat to contain a different value, such as 0x004. You can then run echoid.exe to verify that you're generating a valid lock code, and either generate a license manually via our Customer Service department, or license using spssactivator (in version 16.0 and earlier) or licensactivator (in version 17.0 and later)
