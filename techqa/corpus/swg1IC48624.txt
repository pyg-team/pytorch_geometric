APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS RETURNED (APAR CANNOT BE RESOLVED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFO FROM IBM OR CUSTOMER.)
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In previous releases of Rational Rose (2002.05.00) the ability
   to change multiple values for multiple registry keys was
   available. Now in the 2003.06.15 release you cannot make changes
   to multiple keys at the same time. As in the Rose key and the
   Virtual Path Maps key. This is causing the customer a great deal
   of pain having to import and export registry keys one at a time.
   Could you please support how this has become a regression or why
   this functionality has been removed from the product.
