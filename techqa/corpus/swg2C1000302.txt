SUMMARY
 Previous releases of IBM UrbanCode Deploy are affected by multiple vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-7674 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7674]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin by the CORS Filter. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct client and server side cache poisoning.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-7675 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7675]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the HTTP/2 implementation. By using a specially-crafted URL, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security restraints.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130247 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130247] for the current score
