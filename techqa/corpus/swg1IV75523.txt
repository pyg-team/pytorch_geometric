PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of nonnative probes (e.g. Tivoli EIF probe) parsing    *
   * data with Japanese characters.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The nonnative probe library sometimes incorrectly parsed the *
   * command from the EIF probe to set event elements with        *
   * Japanese characters.  The nonnative probe library parsing    *
   * routine was modified to better handle Japanese characters.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to probe-nco-p-nonnative-18_1                        *
