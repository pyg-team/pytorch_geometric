PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM® Cognos® Report Studio in Tivoli® Common Reporting Version 3.1 and later fix packs fail to launch on Internet Explorer Version 11 

CAUSE
IBM Jazz for Service Management includes the Dashboard Application Services Hub service and the Tivoli Common Reporting service.
Dashboard Application Services Hub supports Internet Explorer v11 in full mode because bundled libraries like Dojo only support Internet Explorer v11 in full mode.
Whereas, the bundled version of Cognos Business Intelligence v10.2.2 within Tivoli Common Reporting supports Internet Explorer v11 in compatibility mode.
When launching Tivoli Common Reporting from Dashboard Application Services Hub, because of browser mode compatibility issues, Cognos Report Studio functionalities do not work as expected.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, access the following Tivoli Common Reporting dispatcher link:
