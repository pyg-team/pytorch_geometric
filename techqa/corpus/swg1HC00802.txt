APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When CATIA V3 model with old annotations is upgraded to CATIA V4
   with new annotations using /annd34 application, the tolerance
   value of a dimension is changed in one model.
   .
   SCENARIO
   1)Take Valmet model ...CAL1000690.00...
     This model includes both old and new annotations.
   2)Look dimension with old tolerance value  +0.03  and new  +0.04
     (The values are in red circle).
   ERROR: The tolerance value has been changed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DIMENS is used to create a dimension with tolerances.
   One of the tolerance value is changed after applying /ANND34 :
   tolerance 0.03 is changed in 0.04
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
   IF THE SUBMITTER WISHES TO SUBMIT THIS ENHANCEMENT FOR
   CONSIDERATION IN A FUTURE VERSION, HE SHOULD TRANSMIT IT VIA
   ENHANCEMENT REQUEST.
   
   In fact the tolerance in the model is 0.035
   The user decide in dimens to put on is value a precision of
   0.01 .
   So the system has to choose between 0.03 and 0.04
   In dimens there is a message
   'WARNING: TOL. LESS THAN PRECISION'
   
   The round off is made only at the visualisation step
   Dimens chooses 0.03 and dimens2 chooses 0.04
   We decide that the visualisation for dimens2 is the good one
   but we cannot change dimens visualisation
   
   After the conversion the two dimension has the same tolerance
   = 0.035
   
    BY-PASS:
   If the precision of the value is suffisant for tolerance
   0.001 in this case the conversion will be OK.
