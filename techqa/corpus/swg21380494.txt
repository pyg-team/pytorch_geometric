QUESTION
 Where is the db2diag.log located on Windows? Where is the default location for the db2diag.log when the Database Manager configuration (dbm cfg) shows DIAGPATH as blank? 

ANSWER
The location of the default location of the db2diag.log is as follows:
For Windows Vista and later operating systems: 
C:\ProgramData\IBM\DB2\<db2 copy name>\DB2

For older Windows operating systems : 
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\DB2\<DB2 copy name>\DB2


(NOTE: "ProgramData" and "Application Data" folders are usually hidden on Windows.)

The default location can be modified by updating the 'DIAGPATH' Database Manager configuration (dbm cfg) parameter to a desired location using the following command:

db2 update dbm cfg using diagpath "<path to db2diag.log>"

(NOTE: The path to db2diag.log may need to be in quotes if there is a space in the path name.)


If you have IBM Data Server Driver package installed, the db2diag.log files will be located in db2subdirectory of the driver install directory.

For example, if you installed the driver under:
C:\Program Files\IBM\IBM DATA SERVER DRIVER

the db2diag.log will be under 
C:\Program Files\IBM\IBM DATA SERVER DRIVER\db2.
