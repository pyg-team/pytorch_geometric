Title: IBM How IBM JDK Determines WPG IP Address Cache - United States

Text:
WPG cache ip address dns TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Due to IBM JDK implementation, when WPG trades with hostname, if the trading partner's IP address is changed, even though the operating system knows about the change, WPG can continue to use the old IP address in the cache 

SYMPTOM
WPG does not reflect the IP address change from the trading partner and this results into document send failure


CAUSE
 WPG uses the Java APIs to connect to any server. The IP Cache used to do the IP lookup while creating a socket is governed by the parameter networkaddress.cache.ttl in the java.security file under <WPG_install>\was\java\jre\lib\security . 

When the value for this property is set to the default value of -1, IP address cache is retained until the servers are restarted. Due to this, any IP change to a hostname , which is already present in the cache, would not be reflected. 

If the users wish to have dynamic updates for such IP address changes,the value should be set to zero or a positive whole number.

Additional information about networkaddress.cache.ttl parameter can be found in the following URL

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A non negative value (zero or positive whole number) should be provided to the property. This will enable refresh of the IP cache after the expiry of the time period provided as value. A value of zero means no cache in this case.
