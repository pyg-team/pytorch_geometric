QUESTION
 Using ITCAM for Transactions V7 with ISM agent and ICMP monitor enabled, an Information Message "ICMP Wrong identifier" is seen in icmp.log monitor log file. 

CAUSE
A manual ping, from a command line, to a server monitored by the ISM ICMP monitor was done

ANSWER
Such messages seen in the ICMP log file is expected in this circumstance. ICMP monitor logs an Information level message when the monitor itself ignores any ICMP traffic; this will include all ICMP traffic received by the server that is not for that monitor. The monitor will receive all ICMP traffic that the server receives, this is just part of how raw sockets work. There is no real problem here.
