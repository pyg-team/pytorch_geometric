ABSTRACT
 WA82 illustrates the use of the MQSeries Workflow Web Client. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
 The Web credit example illustrates the use of the MQSeries Workflow Web Client. It shows how to start a workflow process from a web application, access backend data (DB2 Database) from Java Server Pages invoked as part of a business process from the Web Client and how to store data back to the DB2 database through a User-defined Program Execution Server. The User-defined Program Execution Server is provided as a Java program and as an MQSeries Integrator Message Flow. Complete source code is provided.
