PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to configure your IBM DB2 database connection in IBM Rational Asset Manager results in "Error opening socket to server {machine} on port 60,000 with message: Connection refused. " 

SYMPTOM
You see the following error message: 

 

CRRAM703I: Database - [jcc][t4][2043][11550][3.51.90] Exception java.net.ConnectException: Error opening socket to server {machine} on port 60,000 with message: Connection refused. ERRORCODE=-4499, SQLSTATE=08001 






CAUSE
A possible cause for this problem is that TCP/IP is not properly enabled on your DB2 database server.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the db2set DB2COMM command from the DB2 command window to start the TCP/IP connection: 


db2set DB2COMM=protocol_names 


For example, to set the database manager to start connection managers for the TCP/IP communication protocols, enter the following commands:


db2set DB2COMM=tcpip 

db2stop 

Db2start 





 

If the above command does not resolve the connection problem, contact IBM support.
