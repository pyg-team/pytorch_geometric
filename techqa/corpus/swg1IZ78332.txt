APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.4 running on AIX 6.1
   Connection Manager configured for Mobile Access Services (VPN
   Clients) IP-LAN traffic in particular
   
   Symptom:  LMC is processing data fine and suddenly it stops
   processing the traffic for the ip-lan MNC's.  Externally the VPN
   end users will begin noticing their traffic is not being
   handled.  Logging in and out will not provide relief.  A check
   of the wg.log will show no real logging activity outside of
   monitor intervals.  We believe some logging threads have stopped
   firing.  In some cases the Connection Manager will core dump and
   restart itself.  Other times the observed behavior is that it
   seems like the Connection Manager is hung up as the monitor
   shows that not much IP traffic is passing through the Gateway.
   Restarting the Connection Manager will clear these symptoms.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
