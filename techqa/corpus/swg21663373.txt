Title: IBM SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error  Caused by InvalidKeyException - United States

Text:
JDBC JCC SSL SSLKeyException .InvalidKeyException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My java application using the Data Server Driver for JDBC (JCC) is failing to establish SSL connection with following error:

SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error. Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters. 

SYMPTOM
javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error. Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters 


CAUSE
The default restricted policy file has a 2048 key size limit. If the RSA key size exceeds this limit then this error is expected.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be resolved by upgrading to the unrestricted policy files, replacing the security policy files with the IBM unlimited cryptography files. Replace the local_policy.jar with the Unrestricted JCE policy File. [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/pick.do?source=jcesdk&lang=en_US]
