APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After TLS is enabled in SUA 2.2, scheduled reports silently fail
   to send to their intended recipients.  On the same machine with
   the same settings, but without TLS enabled, the same scheduled
   reports will successfully send.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enable SSL in jetty.xml by changing the "protocol" flag value
   from "TLS" to "SSL_TLS"
