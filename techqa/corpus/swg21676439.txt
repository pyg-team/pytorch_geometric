PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Integration Service takes a long time to start for the first time when there are large JAR files in Process Application as managed assets. 

SYMPTOM
After the Integration Service has executed once, the start up time resumes to its normal speed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Stop your DE and DMGR. 
 2. Locate the 00Static.xml file in your ND environment and open the original configuration file (e.g. DMGR_PROFILE_ROOT\config\cells\cell_name\nodes\custom_node_name\servers\cluster-member-name\server_type\config\system\00Static.xml) in a text editor. 
 3. Locate the property <classloader-resource-map-size> "current value" </classloader-resource-map-size> and copy it. 
 4. Locate the 100custom.xml file in your ND environment. The 100custom file should be located under each cluster member in your DMGR profile under PROFILE_ROOT\config\cells\cell_name\nodes\custom_node_name\servers\cluster-member-name\server_type\config\100Custom.xml. 
 5. Open every 100custom.xml file and locates the last occurrence of </server>. Paste the copied part from step 3 into the file, and save the file. The appended part should look like this:
    <server merge="mergeChildren">
    <classloader-resource-map-size merge="replace">40000</classloader-resource-map-size> </server> 
 6. After making the above changes, restart your DMGR and cluster, and then select Full Resynchronize to replicate the settings from the deployment manager server to the individual nodes. 


Note that the value of the property classloader-resource-map-size in step 5 may be different in your environment because resources in managed assets are different. For example, if your assets have 36000 resource, you should set this value to around 40000.
