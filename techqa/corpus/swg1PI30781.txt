ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Client has an *.arxml that can only be imported in a new
   Rhapsody project. If it is imported in a Rhapsody project to
   which already an old version of this *.arxml file has been
   imported it?s neither possible with the 'overwrite' nor the
   'merge' option to import this *.arxml file.
   
   The client is unable to provide the ARXML file as it contains
   confidential information
   
   After some tries the client was able to do a merge import with
   the updated ARXML file. It seems that duplicate UUIDs in the
   ARXML file prevented from finishing the import.
   
   Since the model is very big verifying it takes a while. One
   issue I already found is the operation tag of a lot of
   OperationInvokedEvents where the operation name is missing, e.g
   ComponentType.Dem.Event_DemEventParameter_100f3 instead of
   ComponentType.Dem.Event_DemEventParameter_100f3.ClearPrestoredFr
   eezeFrame
   
   Here are some statistics:
   
   - initial import took 35 minutes ( 50MB ARXML file)
   - merge import took 76 minutes (54MB ARXML file)
   - physical memory limit nearly reached during merge import. I
   have 16GB RAM installed.
   
   From my point of view these are unacceptable values.
   
   I have tried to export the model into an ARXML file but the
   exporter crashed after 20 minutes. There are core and heap dumps
   available . If they can help you finding the issue I can send
   them to you (unfortunately the packed file is 760MB big).
