PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 users of Data Definition Control     *
   *                 support.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: User received an unexpected SQLCODE     *
   *                      -204 error when running DROP DATABASE   *
   *                      in maintenance mode - ACCESS(MAINT).    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   DB2 was unable to set up an internal control structure for the
   Data Definition Control support during maintenance mode.  This
   resulted in user getting an unexpected SQLCODE -204 error with
   invalid tokens when running DDL statements in maintenance mode
   if Data Definition Control is activated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DB2 has been redesigned to not enforce Data Defintion Control
   during maintenance mode because only users who have
   installation SYSADM or installation SYSOPR authority can access
   data in this mode.  Therefore, users will not run into the
   invalid -204 errors.  However, users should be aware that data
   definition control is not enforced in this mode.  DB2
   publication will be updated accordingly.
