Text:
TSA; TSAMP; SAMP; RSCT; 3.2.0.0 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After a AIX TL upgrade (7.1 or 6.1) the TSAMP cluster is no longer working correctly, issues include badly formatted trace files (dates go back to 1990 and vary), lssam hangs, daemons exit abnormally and others. 

CAUSE
The AIX TL upgrade installed RSCT 3.2.0.0 which is known to be problematic.
Known TL FP to cause this:
AIX 7.1 TL3 SP4
AIX 6.1 TL9 SP4



ANSWER
To resolve this you need to install updates to the RSCT filesets to upgrade them to 3.2.0.5 or higher. The easiest way to ensure you get the highest/most resent version is to check for a core RSCT fileset and show all its versions that are available and choose the most recent version. Open the following link for the rsct.core.utils fileset: 

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1fileset753774238 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1fileset753774238]

The most recent version should be the first listed, now click on the "individual fix" number over on the right side of the page.

Its very important to click the box that says "Include prerequisites and co-requisite fixes" before downloading the package!!!

Also be sure to update the required optional filesets:
rsct.opt.storagerm
rsct.opt.stackdump
