   ****************************************************************
   Enterprise Service Bus(ESB) databases are displayed in
   WebSphere Process Server 's custom deployment environment by
   mistake. ESB doesn't need to configure BPC databases, so BPC
   databases are missing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM WPS V7.0.0.5 that allows users to
   create a custom deployment environment with BPC container
   databases configured.
