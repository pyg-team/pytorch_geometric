APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Execution trace classes are not packaged in the
   jrules-res-session- <appserver>.jar. Although these classes are
   packaged with the XU rar, when the rule session is not in the
   same classloader as the XU, classloading errors may occur.
   
   
   For instance, when the XU is not on the admin server of Weblgic,
   the XU client may throw the following error:
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   ilog.rules.res.session.ruleset.IlrExecutionTrace
           at
   weblogic.utils.classloaders.GenericClassLoader.findLocalClass(Ge
   nericClassLoader.java:297)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For POJO execution, package jrules-res-session-java.jar with the
   execution client. This jar file can be found at
   <ODM_installDir>\ODM\executionserver\lib
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The packaging of the applicaiton server jars is incomplete
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  packaging is fixed
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  use the jrules-res-session-java.jar  instead.
