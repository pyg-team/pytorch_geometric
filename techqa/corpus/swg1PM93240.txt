 *  Build step under Build Forge 8.0 fail with 'TMO Timeout after
   300 seconds' after 5 minutes regardless of the step 'Timeout in
   minutes' setting.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   - Configure UNIX/Linux agent to run local 'sleep' command for
   test.
   
   - Configure selector for UNIX/Linux agent and create project
   with said selector.
   
   - Setup project with single step using the following.
   All other step settings should be default.
   
   Step Name: Sleep for 10 minutes
   Step Command: sleep 3000
   Timeout in minutes: 60
   
   - Start project build.
   
   Expected result:
   
   Build step passes with 10 minutes of execution.
   
   Actual result:
   
   Build step fails with error 'TMO Timeout after 300
   seconds'.
