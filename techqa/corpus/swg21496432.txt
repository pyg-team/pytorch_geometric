PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Scheduled job using a .dbq when run to report services is missing
column heading underlines. They appear if run to an ER PC, but not to 
report services. The output type is PDF.. 
This feature worked in Showcase 7.1 ER and was fixed in Showcase 8.00.460 
for scheduled report writer jobs (.RPT's). 

scserver8 - 8.00.460 - C&DS 4.0.4 

ENVIRONMENT
scserver8 - 8.00.460 - C&DS 4.0.4 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This is a limitation when using queries. 

 
The line seen in the output when it is run through an ER PC is a part of 
a standard formatting template used by the Query Client. Hence, it is 
seen only when a dbq is run through an ER PC. 

Enterprise Reporting would process the query, and generate lines even if not in the query, 
where C&DS only generates what the query has within it. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The workaround would be to add an underline to the column heading within the query, (.DBQ), itself and if a column heading underline is added to the query (.DBQ), it is then preserved when the query (.DBQ) is run through both Report Services as well as an ER PC. 

 
WORKAROUND steps to add an underline: 

NOTE: Need to open the query from the repository within the Query 
client. 
1. Right click on the column and select Headings. 
2. Select the Font button. 
3. Under Effects, check the box for Underline. 
4. Select OK, (twice). 
5. Save the query back to the repository.
