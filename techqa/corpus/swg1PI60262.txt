ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Application Developer (RAD) v9.5.0.1, a local
   WebSphere Portal (WP) v8.5 is not detected automatically or
   listed in:
     Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments
   , AND
   you can not [Add] the WP v8.5 server without getting stuck on
   the [Finish] button  being greyed out.
   Similarly, it is not possible to add it as a new server in the
   "Servers" view
   
   The Add/New server wizard becomes stuck at this page:
   
   //== New Server Runtime Environment
   Runtime Type
     define a WebSphere Portal runtime
   --------
   Name:
     WebSphere Portal v8.5
   WebSphere Portal Location:
     D:\IBM\WPS85
   WebSphere Application Server Location:
     D:\IBM\WAS855ND
   ..                     [Finish]  // greyed out
   //--------
   
   ***
   The Problem is that the [Finish] button is greyed out and there
   is no Message or help explaining why?
   ***
   
   This WP v8.5 server could be started/stopped in a command line.
   
   The client is NOT using typical default install locations and
   profile names, for example a typical Portal directory install
   has these 4 folders:
   C:\IBM\WebSphere
   ..\AppServer
   ..\ConfigEngine
   ..\PortalServer
   ..\wp_profile
   
   In this case, the user had this {wp_profile dir}:
   D:\env\local\portal\profiles\wp85
   They have multiple  {wp_profile}s for development and test
   purposes
   and that would normally be fine.
   
   However, {PortalServer}/wps.properties showed:
   
   //-- D:/IBM/WPS85/wps.properties
   PortalRootDir=D:/IBM/WPS85
   WasRootDir=D:/IBM/WAS855ND
   buildnumber=20160113-1638
   im.appDataLocation=D:/IBM/WPS85/version
   cwProfileHome=D:/env/local/wps-managed/profiles/cw_profile
   WPFamilyName=server
   UnixFilePermissions=550
   fixlevel=CF09
   mode=standard
   im.portalDataName=Portal 8.5
   EngineRootDir=D:/IBM/ConfigEngine
   version=8.5.0.0
   product=IBM WebSphere Portal Server
   //---
   
   It does not have these 2 properties associated with a typical
   {wp_profile}:
   
   ...
   ProfileName={wp_profile}
   ProfileDirectory=C:/IBM/WebSphere/{wp_profile_dir}
   ...
   
   It was not clear why these properties were missing with whatever
   named {wp_profile} the user chose to have
   That would be a separate issue for WPortal Support.
   
   The usability defect  is the greyed out Finish button in the
   wizard, providing no feedback.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. If it is an option, re-install WebSphere Portal v8.5 using
   conventional/default settings.
   
   OR
   
   2.
   The RAD Portal tooling  will dynamically pick up the custom
   profile directory if it is mentioned in the wps.properties
   and  they refer to a legitimate {wp_profile dir}, regardless of
   its name.
   
   Add these properties in {PortalServer}/wps.properties:
   
   ...
   ProfileName={wp_profile}
   ProfileDirectory={Path to}/{wp_profile_dir}
   ...
   
   , corresponding to whatever {wp_profile dir} may be.
   
   The "ProfileDirectory" property must be in the
   <wps_install_dir>/PortalServer/wps.properties file
   
   In this case it was also necessary to engage IBM WebSphere
   Portal support and determine why the custom installation/script
   failed to add these 2 properties.
