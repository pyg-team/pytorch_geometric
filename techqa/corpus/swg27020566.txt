General Information  * Please refer to the WebSphere Message Broker README and [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913]IBM WebSphere Message Broker with Rules and Formatter Extension Version 7.0 README [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020262] for the latest information on this environment. 
 * Before installing any new products, ensure that you review their current Preventative Service Planning (PSP) information. 
 * Where patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. 
 * Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere Message Broker has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere Message Broker Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself.
