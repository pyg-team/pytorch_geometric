Title: IBM Determining whether you are affected by the component upgrade issue in IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control and Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - United States

Text:
upgrade errors FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Some of the recently released IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control and Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control interim fix packs (see below for details on affected versions), fail to perform a complete upgrade for some of the components, even though the upgrade appears to be successful because a new version is reported by Add/Remove programs. 
Please note that the OpenSSL libraries were not affected by this issue and were upgraded in all scenarios. This issue only affects the remote control binaries. 


CONTENT
 An issue with certain upgrade paths has been found, but not all upgrade paths are affected. Only the Windows component installers (setup.exe and MSI packages) are affected. Linux (RPM packages) are not affected.
The component upgrade issue is seen when you use any of the following upgrade paths.

Upgrading from 8.2.1 IF0005 to:
8.2.1 IF0006
9.0.0 IF0004
9.0.1 IF0002
9.1.0 IF0001

Upgrading from 8.2.1 IF0006 to:
9.0.0 GA, IF0001, IF0002, IF0003 or IF0004

Upgrading from Version 9.0.0 IF0002 or IF0003 to: 
9.0.1 IF0002 
9.1.0 IF0001

Upgrading from Version 9.0.1 GA or IF0001 to: 
9.1.0 IF0001

The target ,CLI, broker and gateway components are affected. The server, controller and additional setup utility are not affected by this issue.

Note: The gateway and broker components are not affected when upgrading from any 8.2.1 version to 8.2.1 IF0006 but other upgrade paths might be affected. 

To determine whether you are affected, complete the following steps for each component, target, gateway, broker and CLI.
1) In the Control Panel select Programs and Features.
2) Select the component entry. For example, IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - Gateway
Note the product version that is displayed in the bottom of the Programs and Features window
3) Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the component installation directory
For example, \Program Files(x86)\ IBM\Tivoli\Remote Control\Gateway
4) Right-click the component .exe file, ( target: trc_base.exe, cli: wrc.exe, gateway: trc_gw.exe, broker: trc_icb.exe)
5) Select Properties then click Details.
For the target component you can also right-click the target icon and click About. 

If the File version and Product version that is displayed, is different from the one that you noted in step 2), you must follow the instructions below to successfully upgrade to the new fix pack.

Upgrading the components manually:

You must uninstall the current components before you install the latest interim fix pack, however, due to the corrupted upgrade the uninstall will actually fail. This step is required so that the new fix pack can be installed successfully.

To uninstall the components and upgrade to the latest fix pack complete the following steps:
1. Back up the properties files and the broker certificate.
2. For each affected component, go to Add/Remove Programs and uninstall the component. You will notice the services are still running, this is expected. 
3. Run the component installer for the new fix pack. The component is updated to the correct version. 
4. Stop the component's service (except CLI).
5. Restore the properties file and certificate from step 1.
6. Start the components service.
3. Run the diagnostics fixlets to confirm all machines have been updated correctly.


If the File version and Product version that is displayed, is the same as the one that you noted in step 2), you can perform a standard upgrade.

Alternatively, for Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Lifecycle Management and IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control customers , a set of fixlets to help identify affected machines have been published.

Use the following fixlets to determine whether you are affected.
TROUBLESHOOTING - APARIV61533 Identify affected targets 
TROUBLESHOOTING - APARIV61533 Identify affected brokers
TROUBLESHOOTING - APARIV61533 Identify affected gateways
TROUBLESHOOTING - APARIV61533 Identify affected CLI

Note: For customers still running version 8.2.1, a remediation fixlet has also been published to upgrade the target component.
TROUBLESHOOTING - APARIV61533 8.2.1 Target remediation

For versions 9.x run the uninstall task first before deploying the new fix pack in all affected machines.
