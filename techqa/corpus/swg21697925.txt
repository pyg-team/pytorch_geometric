QUESTION
What are IBM's plans for Notes and Domino support of TLS 1.2?

ANSWER
 

As a follow-up to the TLS 1.0 deliveries [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/IBM_Domino_TLS_1.0] IBM released in Q4 2014, IBM released TLS 1.2 deliveries in Q1 2015. The TLS 1.2 protocol enhancements are introduced in Interim Fix 2 for Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 3 and in Interim Fix 3 for Notes 9.0.1 Fix Pack 3. Download links and specific SPRs addressed in these Interim Fixes may be found at the following link: 

 * technote 1657963 - Interim Fixes for 9.0.1.x versions of IBM Notes, Domino, iNotes & Notes Browser Plug-in [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963]

The same content was released in Notes & Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 4 in June 2015. TLS 1.2 will not be available for 8.5.x releases since the TLS 1.2 specification requires updated cryptographic libraries that are available only in Domino 9.0 and above. 


DIIOP and ISpy will support TLS in the upcoming 9.0.1 Fix Pack 5 which currently is due for release in Q4 2015 ( click here to monitor status [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/%28Progress%29/$First?OpenDocument]). Releases prior to 9.0.1 FP5 do not support TLS and will not function if the notes.ini DISABLE_SSLV3=1 is set after the patch is applied. They will continue to work over SSLv3 as long as you do not disable SSLv3 or use a connection without SSL. All other protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, LDAP/LDAPS, SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 are covered by this new patch. SPRs tracking open issues: 

 * PJON9UBQMR - DIIOP connections over SSL fail if SSLv3 is disabled 
 * ITDL9U329W - DIIOP task not working for SHA-2 certificates in Domino 
 * SVRO9UZRQC - ISpy (runjava) fails to connect if SSLv3 is disabled
