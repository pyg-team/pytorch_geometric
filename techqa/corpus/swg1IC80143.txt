ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DataPower's LDAP client does not do SSL caching; it uses a new
   key exchange for every connection.
   You can detect the problem if you configure an SSL proxy
   profile. Set DataPower as an SSL client and set Client-side
   Session Caching on. Then configure DataPower as an LDAP client
   by using this SSL proxy profile.
   If you initiate an LDAP connection from DataPower and capture
   packets between DataPower and LDAP server, note that every
   connection uses a new key exchange.
