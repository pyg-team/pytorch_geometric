QUESTION
 In the Classifications application, you will see two checkboxes, “Generate Description” and “Use Classification”. What do these two boxes actually control? 

ANSWER
The 'Generate Description?' checkbox
- If you tick this checkbox, Maximo will overwrite the object (asset/item/location)'s description using this classification parents' descriptions (this will copy the actual classification path).
If this checkbox is not ticked, then Maximo will not overwrite the object's description field.

The 'Use Classification?' checkbox
- If you tick this checkbox and you also tick the "Generate Description" checkbox, Maximo will copy this Classification parents' descriptions and the description of this Classification to the object (asset/item/location)'s description field.
- If this checkbox is not ticked but the "Generate Description" is ticked, then Maximo will overwrite the object (asset/item/location)'s description field using this Classification's parents' descriptions only.

For example (On Maximo demo): 

Classification = DOM
Parent Classification = TUBING
Classification Path = TUBING \ DOM
DOM description = Drawing over a Mandrel
TUBING description = Tubing

- If you did not tick the "Generate Description" checkbox, it does not matter if you ticked the "Use Classification" checkbox or not, Maximo will NOT overwrite the object (asset/item/location) description field.

- If you ticked the "Generate Description" checkbox, but did not tick "Use Classification" when saving, Maximo will overwrite the object description to "Tubing" (example).

- If you ticked both "Generate Description" and "Use Classification" checkboxes, when saving, Maximo will overwrite the object description to "Tubing, Drawing over a Mandrel" (example).
