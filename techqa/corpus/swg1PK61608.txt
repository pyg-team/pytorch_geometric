LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IBM HTTP Server configurations with          *
   * SSL Client Certificate revocation checking                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Certificate Revocation List (CRL)       *
   * checking slows as the number of revoked certificates grows   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: This fix is recommended for configurations   *
   * where the directive SSLClientAuth contains the 'CRL' option  *
   * and certificate revocation info is available via the OCSP    *
   * protocol                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   CRL processing requires loading the entire list from the LDAP
   server, and if the list is large then extensive CPU is
   required to parse the list and check it at runtime.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IHS now has the option of using OCSP, a more efficient
   certificate revocation checking protocol.  New directives
   SSLOCSPEnable and SSLOCSPResponderURL are added and may be used
   either in addition to or independently of the legacy CRL
   checking.
   .
   Example:
   <VirtualHost *:443>
     SSLEnable
     SSLClientAuth Required
     SSLOCSPResponderURL http://ocsp.example.com:2560/ [http://ocsp.example.com:2560/]
   </VirtualHost>
   .
