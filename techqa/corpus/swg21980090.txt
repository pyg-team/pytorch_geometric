QUESTION
 Why am I receiving a request for licensing of IBM SPSS Statistics 24 network/concurrent clients after providing the License Manager host hostname or IP address? 

CAUSE
'Trial' license file (lservrc) not removed/renamed for Statistics 24 network/concurrent client installations.

ANSWER
The reported behavior was corrected in an updated version of the Statistics 24 desktop client that was uploaded on June 23, 2016. 

If you are encountering this behavior prior to a mass installation of the product, please download the updated version of the Statistics 24 desktop client and use this version for your installations.

If you are encountering this behavior after a mass installation of the product, the immediate corrective ('work-around') for this behavior is to delete the 'lservrc' present in the installation directory of the Statistics 24 network licensing client. 

If you are using encountering this behavior after a mass installation of the product using automated installation technology to install the product, you could delete the 'lservrc' file as a command line instruction into your deployment script using a command argument such as:

Windows (via Administrator Command Prompt)
cd C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24\&del lservrc&exit

Note: This command argument example assumes the bit-version of both Statistics and the Windows operating system are aligned (i.e. either both 32-bit or both 64-bit, not 32-bit client on 64-bit OS).

Mac (via Terminal)
cd /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents/bin/;sudo rm lservrc;killall Terminal

Linux (via Terminal)
cd /opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/bin;sudo rm lservrc;exit
