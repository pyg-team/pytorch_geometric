Title: IBM Information Server 8.7 fixpack 1 installation fails with an exception like "java.lang.Exception: Exit Code: 11, Error: Unable to redeploy the module: CORBA MARSHAL 0x4942f89a No; nested exception is:

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During installion of Information Server 8.7 fixpack 1, the following exception occurs during the redeployment of web applications (.ear files) such as datastage_api_restservices.ear:

java.lang.Exception: Exit Code: 11, Error: Unable to redeploy the module: CORBA MARSHAL 0x4942f89a No; nested exception is:
org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL: Unable to read value from underlying bridge : Mismatched serialization UIDs 

SYMPTOM
The update installer puts up an exception dialog box containing the above exception, and offers the user choices to retry the operation, continue the installation without retrying, or exit the installation.


CAUSE
This can arise when the user attempts to install 8.7 fixpack 1 after a previous attempt to install it failed. Depending on what caused the previous failure, temporary files may have been left in directories under the WebSphere profile that are used during WebSphere's application deployment process. These temporary files can interfere with a subsequent attempt to deploy the same application in a way that causes exceptions of the type shown above.

ENVIRONMENT
Information Server 8.7, on any platform, where a previous attempt to install a patch or fixpack failed during deployment of a Web application or service into Websphere.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If an exception of the type mentioned here is seen, the user should look in the directory:




WebSphere-home/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphereProfile (UNIX and Linux platforms) 

or 

WebSphere-home\AppServer\profiles\InfoSphereProfile (Windows) 

and see if there are directories "wstemp", "temp", or "config/temp". If these directories exist, and contain files, they are the likely cause of the problem. Here WebSphere-home is the directory where the WebSphere software is installed, and InfoSphereProfile is the directory containing the profile in which Information Server is installed. By default this will be called "InfoSphere" when the profile is a stand-alone application server. If the Websphere in question is a cluster, then InfoSphereProfile refers to the Deployment Manager profile.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Stop WebSphere. On Linux and UNIX platforms, this can be done with the command: 

InformationServerHome/AppServer/bin/MetadataServer.sh stop 

On Windows the application server can be started and stopped with Start Menu choices under: 

Start Menu->All Programs->IBM WebSphere->Application Server Network Deployment V7.0->Profiles->InfoSphere->Stop the Server 

2. Delete the "wstemp", "temp", and "config/temp" directories from the WebSphere profile. 

Restart WebSphere. On UNIX this can be done with the command: 

InformationServerHome/AppServer/bin/MetadataServer.sh run 

On Windows, use the Start Menu item: 

Start Menu->All Programs->IBM WebSphere->Application Server Network Deployment V7.0->Profiles->InfoSphere->Start the Server 

3. Retry the installation operation that failed by selecting "retry" in the update installer's exception dialog box. If the update installer is no longer running, then it will be necessary to re-run the fixpack installation. In this case the InformationServerHome/Updates/bin/installUpdates command should be invoked with the -force option.
