APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java is set to true
   and if com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java.track is NOT
   set then by default a java thread dump is created continuously
   at the default hung thread detection time interval (default 3
   mins). So basically it will continuously produce java thread
   dumps every minute while the thread remains hung.
   
   In customer situation the hung thread never recovers and as a
   result a java thread dump is produced every 3 minutes and
   fills up gigabytes of storage.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can set
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java to 1
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The hung thread detection system        *
   *                      repeatedly dumps javacores for the      *
   *                      same hung thread                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The WebSphere Application Server thread monitor allows users
   to track hung threads by periodically dumping a javacore as
   long as the thread is detected as hung, using the
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java.track property.
   If this property is unset, the default value is set to be
   identical to the value of
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java.  If the property is
   set to "true", the thread monitor sets those properties to the
   maximum integer value, so a thread hung for a long period of
   time would cause javacores to be thrown basically
   indefinitely.
   Users who had used this property on previous editions of
   WebSphere Application Server would have been likely to use the
   "true" value, as the property utilized boolean values in its
   original incarnation, but since the "track" property did not
   exist, they would have only had one javacore thrown per thread.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The default value of the "track" property was modified so that
   if left unset, only one javacore would be thrown for a single
   hung thread.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 8.5.5.12 and 9.0.0.3.  Please refer to the

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  As a workaround, users can set the system property
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.dump.java.track to "1".
