ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Following an upgrade from Impact 2.3 to Impact 3.x the upgrader
   process would prepend the property USE_SHARED_SCOPE at the start
   of each converted Policy (.ant > .ipl).  This property allowed
   the continued use of global variable usage across function
   calls.  This was due to the function based replica the updater
   made of the Action Node Tree format in modern Impact Policy
   Language and the need to carry variables assignments throughout
   the subsequent Policy process.
   
   This worked without issue throughout Impact 3.x & 4.x, but has
   proved to cease functioning in Impact 5.1, though one would have
   expected the Impact Policies to have been rewritten into pure
   and efficient IPL without the need for USE_SHARED_SCOPE so long
   after Impact 2.x went End Of Support.
   
   Never the less, this legacy property should work in Impact 5.1
   and currently it doesn't.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Simply rewrite the Policy in correct, modern IPL and, if using
   variables across function calls, use reference variables (as
   stipulated in the documentation of user defined functions).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IMPACT 5.1 POLICY NO LONGER RECOGNISES THE USE_SHARED_SCOPE
   PROPERTY THAT ALLOWED USE OF GLOBAL VARIABLES ACROSS FUNCTIONS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Policy that are imported from Impact 2.x going forward to Impact
   5.1 don't make a use of USE_SHARED_SCOPE to treat all variables
   as global.
