PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V5.1, the jobs submitted from the Internal Reader are now running under the wrong userid. Instead of using the userid of the task that wrote the JCL to the internal reader, the job is using the CICS region userid. You are using CA Top Secret Security as the external security manager (ESM). 

SYMPTOM
The problem with the jobs being submitted with the userid of the CICS region only occurs when the JCL is submitted to the internal reader through an indirect transient data queue (TDqueue) destination. If the JCL is written to a TD queue that is pointing directly to the DD associated to the Internal Reader, the job is submitted with the correct userid.


CAUSE
The CA Top Secret IJU parameter should cause a USERID= to be included in the job card when written to the internal reader. However, after migrating to CICS TS V5.1, this functionality is no longer working and no USERID= is being added to the job card. As such, when the JCL is run, the job runs under the CICS region userid.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply CA fix TR70790 to resolve this problem. Contact [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676064&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies Support [http://www.ca.com/] if you need additional assistance.
