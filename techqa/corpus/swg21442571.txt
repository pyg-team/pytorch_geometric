QUESTION
 What is SSL session caching of DataPower? What is the meaning of Server-side Session Caching, Server-side Session Timeout and Server-side Session Cache Size? Will it affect SSL renegotiation? 

ANSWER
There are three SSL session caching-related options in SSL proxy profile: 

 * Server-side Session Caching 
 * Server-side Session Timeout 
 * Server-side Session Cache Size

Every SSL handshake generates an "SSL session id". When Server-side Session Caching is enabled, the initial ssl session id will be cached. Then, the next time that same client connects, the server will check to see if  * There is an existing SSL Session ID for that client 
 * That session ID is cached and still valid.

If these are confirmed, an abridged or short SSL handshake will be used to improve performance. 

The Server-side session timeout defines the timeout in seconds for each entry in the server-side session cache. The Server-side Session Cache Size defines the entry size of session cache. 
To clarify the SSL Renegotiation behavior by version, see How do I enable insecure SSL Renegotiation in an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Service. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432579] 

When the SSL negotiation happens, the client and server will renegotiate ciphers, encryption/decryption keys, etc. A new entry will be created in the SSL session cache and the cached session will become invalid even though the entry is not timedout.
