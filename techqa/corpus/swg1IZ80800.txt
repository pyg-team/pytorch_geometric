   ABSTRACT:             Document when and how to change encryption
   keys on
   VIOS
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   There is no documentation describing when and how to change the
   encryption key values for the VIOS Premium and CEC Base agents
   after the agents have been installed in a VIOS environment.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS: None.
   
   
   LOCAL FIX:
   
   If the encryption key must be set to a non-default value for
   the VIOS Premium or CEC Base agent on VIOS, follow these
   instructions:
   
   Enter "oem_setup_env" to go to the Unix shell on the VIOS
   system.
   
   Remove the current "keyfiles" directory from the ITM install
   location:
      # cd /opt/IBM/ITM
      # rm -R keyfiles
   
   Issue "find /usr/lpp -name install.sh"
      find /usr/lpp -name install.sh
   
   This will show the location of the ITM install.sh for System P
   agents
   that come pre-installed on VIOS.
   
   Running this install.sh should go through the installation
   process
   for CEC and VIOS agents, prompting for the encryption key to
   set.
      # /usr/lpp/itm.premium/itm_agent/install.sh
   
   Example output from running the install.sh:
   ***
   INSTALL
   
   Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring directory
   [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]:
   
   ITM home directory "/opt/IBM/ITM" already exists.
   OK to use it [ 1-yes, 2-no; "1" is default ]? 1
   
   The following processes are currently running:
   
   Product = Base Monitoring Agent for CEC PID = 618672
   Product = Premium Monitoring Agent for VIOS PID = 209100
   install.sh warning: Existing products found to be running will
