PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I determine how much memory I need on my UNIX box for translation? (2930) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following formula will help determine the amount of memory required for translation: 
Step 1: get the ratio of a small sample (run a small version) (input_doc_byte_size + output_doc_byte_size) / input_doc_byte_size (20,000,000 + 10,000,000) / 20,000,000 = 1.5 
Step 2: get the number of pages of data size required (ratio * input_doc_byte_size) / 1024 ((1.5 * 20,000,000) / 1024) = 29297 pages (Input from sample test) ((1.5 * 60,000,000) / 1024) = 87891 pages (Input from file generating error) 
Step 3: round up if needed, but never down 
Step 4: take the number of pages of user process data size, most sysdef commands report in pages, most system administration tools report in bytes. HP/UX calls this parameter maxdsiz. Use the OS supplies to tune this max user process data size and calculate from here: pages = 87891, bytes = (87891* 4096) = 360001536 Step 5: rebuild the OS, and reboot Step 6: verify with sysdef (or other OS command) to make sure changes were applied and you are off and running. 
NOTE: input_doc_byte_size it the size of a single document (set) not the input file size NOTE: If the system does not have lots of RAM, the over flow will go to swap space and the system will come to a screaching halt if it runs out. When bumping up this parameter make sure there is lots of swap space configured for a busy system or you will crash it (swap on most OS's now keeps a mirror of core plus active user data). The system will only go into swap if core is full and the this memory is released after each set is translated. Additional kernel paramters may have to modified by the sysadm to prevent the machine from going inot a state were all it does is swap memery depending on the resources. HP/UX version before 11.00 have a 2GB barrier.
