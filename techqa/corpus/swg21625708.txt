Title: IBM Potential XSS cannot be reproduced manually - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is an XSS (Cross-Side Scripting) vulnerability from IBM Security AppScan Standard a real vulnerability if not possible to reproduce manually in any current Internet Explore or FireFox browser? 

CAUSE
AppScan Standard flags an XSS (Cross-Side Scripting) vulnerability, since the application reflects the inserted JavaScript. 
However you cannot reproduce manually the vulnerability in any browser. You tried to reproduce the vulnerability manually in 

 * IE versions: 8.0, 9.0 
 * FireFox versions: 3.5, 10.0, 17.0 and 18.0 
 * Chrome version 24.0 

You never get the inserted dialog up. The browser is not executing the mirrored JavaScript. 
ANSWER
It does NOT matter if the script is executed by the browser or not. It matters that the application reflects back the inserted input. Some browsers has filters to filter out some XSS. However the vulnerability still exists, since the vulnerability may show when using another version of IE or another browser. 


You should not make assumptions about what browsers your potential attackers or users might be using. If you want to replicate the issue use an older browser like IE6, or a WYSIWYG web developer tool with a preview window, since those tools don't employ any browser side security. 

Below there is a screenshot from HTML-kit showing the popup occurring for a vulnerability that was not able to be reproduced in the above browers:
