PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rhapsody crashes with error "Rhapsody MFC application has stopped working" when trying to load a model into 64 bit version of Rhapsody. 

SYMPTOM
Rhapsody is launched successfully but when loading a model from menu, Rhapsody instantly crashed with the error message "Rhapsody MFC application has stopped working ". This crash is known to occur with 64 bit version of Rhapsody. Reinstallation of the product doesn't solve the problem.


CAUSE
The root cause is under investigation.

ENVIRONMENT
64 bit version of Rhapsody running on Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are three possible workarounds identified: 




 * Try latest version of Rhapsody if available The version of JRE bundled with Rhapsody was upgraded to 8.0 from Rhapsody v8.1.4 which reportedly works on the affected machine. 
   
   


 * Configure to use external JRE  1. Install Oracle JRE 7 64 bit 
    2. Exit Rhapsody if it's running 
    3. Backup existed rhapsody.ini 
    4. Open rhapsody.ini from any text editor like NotePad 
    5. Change JavaLocation info in [JVM] category:
       ## before ##
       
       JavaLocation=C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.1.1\jre 
       
       
       ## after ##
       
       JavaLocation=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7\jre
       
    6. Save the change, launch Rhapsody 
    7. Load a model, and check everything works fine
       
       
   
   
 * Modify Plugins setting in rhapsody.ini  1. Exit Rhapsody if it's running 
    2. Backup existed rhapsody.ini 
    3. Open rhapsody.ini from any text editor like NotePad 
    4. Remove "RhapsodyApps" and "SpellChecker" from Plugins list under [Plugin] entry:
       ## before ##
       
       Plugins=RhapsodyApps,SpellChecker,RulesPlayer 
       
       
       ## after ##
       
       Plugins=RulesPlayer
       
    5. Comment out the whole [SpellChecker] and [RhapsodyApps] entries like below:
       
       #[SpellChecker]
       #Name=Spell Checking
       #isPlugin=1
       #DLLServerCompatible=TRUE
       #isVisible=1
       #JavaMainClass=com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.spellchecker.SpellCheckerManager
       #JavaClassPath=$OMROOT/SpellCheck/RhapsodySpellChecker.jar;$OMROOT/SpellCheck/L#angWare/com.ibm.langware.core.runtime_7.2.0.201111100545.jar;
       #RhpVersion=8.1.1
       
       #[RhapsodyApps]
       #Name=RhapsodyApps
       #JavaMainClass=com.ibm.rhapsody.core.RAPlugin
       #DLLServerCompatible=TRUE
       #JavaClassPath=$OMROOT/RhapsodyApps/RhapsodyApps.jar
       #HepFile=$OMROOT/RhapsodyApps/RhapsodyApps.hep
       
    6. Save the change, launch Rhapsody 
    7. Load a model, and check, everything works fine
