ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a problem with the lqma handling of a TMF transaction
   that is being rollbacked. This is causing the lqma process to
   abend.
   Why the TMF transction code not be started is still a mystery.
   When a channel starts it does a MQSET on the xmitq to GET
   enable it. This is where the lqma is getting involved.
   I would except to see channel start messages in the qmgr
   AMQERR.LOG and EC unexpected failure messages for the lqma
   processes.
