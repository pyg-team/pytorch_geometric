ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is the customer comment:
   In R12 and R13, LDAP authentication is performed
   differently.
   First the LDAP is sent a search request for the CN.
   The CN comes
   directly from the login screen. In R11, this step
   does not exist.
   You see in R13 that my attempt at using
   jason.levandoski as I had
   done in R11 does not work. This is because
   jason.levandoski is my
   network account name and not my CN. My CN
   should be Jason
   Levandoski.
   When I use Jason Levandoski you see LDAP
   responds by saying that it
   found 1 record. Now that SmarTeam believes I
   exist, it then tries
   to bind with LDAP using my full DN. This is the
   same as in R11,
   however, now SmarTeam URL encodes the DN
   string which it sends to
   LDAP. For instance spaces in the DN string are
   converted to %20.
   This is where the problem lies, because this string
   is encoded, MS
   Active Directory LDAP does not decode the string
   properly
   This is a regression from R11:
   Customer use to work in ST with LDAP
   authentication
   On his site they have Active Directory installed
   This is how he use to work. And all work fine
   After he upgrade ST to R13 SP7
   He canﾨt use the LDAP authentication
   According to the Information that I get now it is not
   possible to use LDAP authentication
   With Active Directory. Thatﾨs not acceptable by the
   Customer
   I asked him to change the authentication to Active
   Directory. And the search took a long time to make
   a login
   To SmarTeam. It takes about 10 ﾨ 15min. to each
   ST login. Not acceptable by the Customer
   The problem:
   Customer canﾨt use LDAP authentication with AD
   (they donﾨt have LDAP install) on R11
   In R13 they canﾨt login with LDAP authentication
   Expected:
   If the search base was change from R11 (the
   authentication was made against the DB and not
   against the Domain)
   It is very important to allow the Customer to Make
   more then one search base in the authentication
   AD Page
   Or the increase the Performance in the Active
   Directory from 10 ﾨ 15min to acceptable time

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  LDAP on STV5R13 not working
   This is the customer comment:
   In R12 and R13, LDAP authentication is performed
