ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DESC: I installed the above agents at Client site but I had a
   strange
         issue while conifiguring the MS SQL instances.
   
         Scenario:
         1) double click the MS SQL agent template
         2) configure 4 instances
         3) configured the variables, for each instance, to support
   the
            cluster configuration, therefore CTIRA_HOSTNAME and
            CTIRA_HIST_DIR
         4) verified the .ini file and the registry entry for the
   custom
            variables
         5) started the agents
         6) verified the data in the TEP
   
         Everything fine at this point.
         Suppose that I have to configure a new instance, here the
   problem
         starts.
         Below the recreation steps, extremely simple.
   
         1) double click the MS SQL agent template
         2) configure another instances
   
         When you close the dialog to configure the templates, all
   the
         custom variables for the previously defined instances get
   lost,
         and they disappear from both the .ini files for the
   instances and
         the registry.
   
         The issue is the same even if you delete a previously
   configured
         instance.
