ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:  Linux WPG 6.2.1 DB2
   
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlException:
    [jcc][10120][10943][3.62.57] Invalid ooperation: statement is
   closed.    ERRORCODE=-4470, SQLSTATE=null
   
   A communication error occurred during operations on the
   connection's underlying socket, socket input stream, or socket
   output stream.  Error location: Reply.fill() -
   socketInputStream.read (-1).  Message: Connection timed out.
   ERRORCODE=-4499, SQLSTATE=08001:
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.DisconnectNonTransientConnectionException:
   [jcc][t4][2030][11211][3.64.106]
   
   "Why does WPG not handle the exception and recover/retry the
   transaction once the StaleConnectionException occurs?".
   StaleConnectionExceptions do happen for various reasons and it
   is best practice for applications catch the SCE and retry
   regardless.
   
   WPG analyzed if SCE has to be handled and retry to be done with
   some delay. Based on customer's input that RNIF protocol retry
   happening in 2 hrs and sometimes 4 hrs, even if additional
   retries are made after handling SCE it won't solve the problem
