 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I obtain the latest RHEL patches, including security updates, for IBM OS Images for Red Hat Linux Systems? 

ANSWER
IBM delivers patches (including security fixes) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata] policy. As stated in the Red Hat policy, fixes are not provided for all vulnerabilities on all RHEL versions; therefore IBM cannot deliver security fixes for some RHEL issues. 

When security and other related updates are available from Red Hat, they can be applied to the virtual machines deployed from IBM PureApplication System that are affected using the following methods:
· The Red Hat Satellite Service [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCR9A_2.2.0/doc/iwd/apc_redhat_satlitesrv.dita?lang=en] shared service.
· Emergency fixes that IBM delivers with the updates. They can be downloaded and applied to the IBM OS Images for Red Hat Linux virtual machines.

IBM publishes Security Bulletins with additional information for security related updates. Customers should subscribe to My Notifications [https://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/myview/subscription/css.wss/]to be notified of important IBM PureApplication System support alerts.
