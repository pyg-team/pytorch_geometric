QUESTION
 Is there a way to use TCR Reporting for the BN DataPower agent? 

ANSWER
Currently as of 1H2015, there is no TCR Template available for the BN DataPower agent (v7.01 FP1). So, if you are looking to download a TCR template for this agent, you will not find any on Passport Advantage. There is an open RFE out on the RFE website which documents this requirement. 

The RFE link is:

So, if you want to use TCR for the DataPower agent, you have to Custom reporting inside of TCR itself.
