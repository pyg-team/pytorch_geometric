STERLINGPRI TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Oracle driver ojdbc14.jar has misleading manifest # . correct version is 9.2.0.5 Yantra System management console display correct version 

SYMPTOM
Manifest file of ojdbc14.jar has incorrect driver version number in manifest file. 

An incorrect driver version can manifest itself in YFC0011 errors when inserting long columns into Yantra tables.
Even with the correct version of the driver, the manifest file mentions the wrong version#, hence this solution.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Oracle has provided a jdbc driver for oracle9i RAC , sometimes Oracle doesnt package the right drivers with their 9i server product, 
also the Appserver might package an ojdbc14.jar in say AppServer/lib.

This could cause the customer to end up using incorrect driver of version less than 9.2.0.5.

Problem can be resolved by replacing the driver with Yantra recommended version 9.2.0.5.0 . from the below url 
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html

Oracle9i 9.2.0.5
Release 9.2.0.5 README 

For use with JDK 1.4 
ojdbc14.jar - JDBC classes (1,200,046 bytes)

you might have to rename the file as oracleDriver.zip, depending on your yfs settings.

After this launch Yantra's 7x system management console and check the database section, which should display the correct version of the Driver. i,e 9.2.0.5. 



Note: For correct driver version , we should be looking at System Management console not the Manifest file.
