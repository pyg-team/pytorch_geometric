APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WebSphere MQ MFT 'fteListAgents' command for the protocol
   bridge agent returns the following warning message:
   "BFGCL0014W: No agents exist that match the current selection
   criteria".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1) Specify the name of the agent followed by an asterisk
   character.
   
    For example:
   
    fteListAgents MY_BRIDGE_AGENT*
   
   
   2) Specify the name of the agent followed by the string:
   
    "MY_BRIDGE_AGENT (  )"
   
   where  can be one of the following strings:
   
    - bridge
    - Web Gateway
    - Connect:Direct bridge
   
    For example:
   
    fteListagents "MY_BRIDGE_AGENT ( bridge )"
   
   3) Use the fteShowAgentDetails command to get status information
   about a particular agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ Managed File
   Transfer command fteListAgents who specify a pattern argument
   that is exactly the name of an agent which is of type protocol
   bridge, Connect:Direct bridge or web.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The WebSphere MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT) command:
   
     fteListAgents
   
   can be used to list all of the agents that are registered with a
   particular coordination queue manager. The command provides
   additional information for some agents to identify their types.
   This is the case for protocol bridge agents, Connect:Direct
   bridge agents and web agents. For example:
   
   $ ./fteListAgents
   5724-H72 Copyright IBM Corp. 2008, 2013. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
   Agent Name: Queue Manager Name: Status:
   AGENT1 MFT_QMGR STOPPED
   AGENT2 MFT_QMGR READY
   PBAGENT ( bridge ) MFT_QMGR READY
   
   In the above example output, the agents with names "AGENT1" and
   "AGENT2" are standard WebSphere MQ MFT agents,. However the
   agent with name "PBAGENT" is a protocol bridge agent, identified
   by the string " ( bridge )" appended to the agents name.
   
   The fteListAgents command accepts an optional pattern parameter
   that is used to filter the list of agents that are displayed in
   the command output. For example, the pattern "A*" can be used to
   list all known WebSphere MQ MFT agents whose name begins with
   "A":
   
   $ ./fteListAgents "A*"
   5724-H72 Copyright IBM Corp. 2008, 2013. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
   Agent Name: Queue Manager Name: Status:
   AGENT1 MFT75_QMGR STOPPED
   AGENT2 MFT75_QMGR READY
   
   
   The pattern provided when invoking the command should have been
   used to filter against the name of an agent. However, it was
   being used to match against the name displayed on the output of
   the command. For non-standard agents (bridge, Connect:Direct
   bridge and web), this resulted in the pattern being matched
   against more than just the agent name. For these types of agents
   therefore, if the pattern specified on the fteListAgents command
   was exactly the name of a non-standard agent, then the matching
   would fail and the command would return the message:
   
     BFGCL0014W: No agents exist that match the current selection
   criteria.
   
   even in the case where an agent with the name specified existed
   and was registered with the coordination queue manager.
   
   Continuing the example above where a protocol bridge agent with
   the name "PBAGENT" exists, specifying the name of the agent as
   the pattern returns no results:
   
   $ ./fteListagents PBAGENT
   5724-H72 Copyright IBM Corp. 2008, 2013. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
   BFGCL0014W: No agents exist that match the current selection
   criteria.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT) code for the
   fteListAgents command has been updated such that when a pattern
   to filter the list of agents displayed is provided, it is
   matched against both the agent name and the displayed agent name
   on the commands output. Therefore patterns that exactly match
   the name of a WebSphere MQ MFT agent, regardless of agent type,
   will be listed in the output of the command.
   
   This APAR still permits the pattern provided to be matched
   against the display name of the agent. As such, in the case
   where a user only wants to list agents of type protocol bridge,
   they can specify, for example, the pattern "* ( bridge )". This
   pattern will fail to match against any agent names, but will
   match against the displayed agent names when the agents are of
   protocol bridge type.
