PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you attempt to create a UML-to-JPA or JPA-to-UML transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect, you will get a "Configuration creation error" message. 

SYMPTOM
At the moment that you try to create the UML-to-JPA or JPA-to-UML in the New Transformation Configuration wizard, the the following error appears: 

Configuration creation error: The transformation with id com.ibm.xtools.transform.uml2.ejb3.java.jpa.internal.UML2JPATransform could not be created. Please ensure the transformation has been declared properly in the plug-in manifest 

as in the screenshot:

The following output is written to the .log file:

CAUSE
You have Rational Software Architect (as opposed to IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere) installed, but the Extension for SOA and WebSphere licence is not available, even if it has also been installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SOLUTIONS

There are three possible solutions, depending on your requirements: 

 * Configure a licence for Extension for SOA and WebSphere


Although the Extension for SOA and WebSphere licence will not be necessary if you intend to use 
Rational Software Architect for just UML-to-JPA transformations, the Extension for SOA and 
WebSphere licence will be necessary, if you would like to use such features as EJB transformations, 
EJB modeling, or Java Development in addition to the UML-to-JPA transformations. 

Refer to the matrices at Rational IT Solution Architecture and Construction v8 Offerings and Eclipse 3.6: Detailed Feature Comparison Matrix [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010975] for more information about Rational Software Architect and Rational Software Architect for WebSphere features. 

OR 
 * Uninstall your current IBM Rational Software Architect installation completely and then install IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere


If you have installed IBM Rational Software Architect, but you have licences for IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere, you can replace your Rational Software Architect installation with Rational Software Architect for WebSphere. IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere contains the features that the Extension for SOA and WebSphere supplies to IBM Rational Software Architect, as indicated in the matrices. 

OR 
 * Keep your current IBM Rational Software Architect installation and uninstall the Extension for SOA and WebSphere


If you only plan to do UML-to-JPA transformations (and vice versa) and you do not need the other features that the Extension for SOA and WebSphere provides, you can uninstall the Extension for SOA and WebSphere. The Extension for SOA and WebSphere licence will not be necessary.
