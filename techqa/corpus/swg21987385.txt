 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Websphere Application Server (WAS) Full profile is shipped as a component of Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM) and WAS has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0359 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0359]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information. 
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111929 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111929] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 
CVEID: CVE-2016-1181 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1181]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the failure to protect against unintended remote operations against components on server memory by the ActionForm instance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113852 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113852] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-1182 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1182]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper validation of input by the Validator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify validation rules and error messages.
CVSS Base Score: 4.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113853] for the current score
