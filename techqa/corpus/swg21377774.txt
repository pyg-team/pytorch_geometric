Text:
HA HighAvailability MemoryToMemory WAS WebSphere TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Multiple serialization errors after enabling Memory to Memory replicaiton in Websphere Application Server running IBM Tivoli Identity Manager 5.1 (ITIM). 

SYMPTOM
Error seen in SystemOut.log file on WebSphere server: 

 
[3/6/09 11:02:23:427 EST] 00000010 HttpSessDRSBu E storeObject: Caught Exception while trying to serialize. Stack trace: java.io. 
NotSerializableException: com.ibm.itim.ui.impl.AccountImpl 
at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(ObjectOutputStream. java:1113) 
Error seen in Stack Trace

[3/9/09 12:06:15:444 EDT] 00000012 HttpSessDRSBu E storeObject: Caught Exception while trying to serialize. Stack trace: 
java.io.NotSerializableException: com.ibm.itim.ui.common.ListenerHelper 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It can be seen from stack trace, memory to memory replication has been enabled, and session manager tries to replicate session entry. 
In order to support memory to memory replication, an application should only put objects in session that can serialize. As session manager can not serialize this object com.ibm.itim.ui.common.ListenerHelper it runs into this exception.

As of this writing, no plans are in place for ITIM to support memory to memory replication, therefore; it is not a supported configuration.
