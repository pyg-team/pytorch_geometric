APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have an N user network license for Statistics.  When the
   N+1th user tries to launch Statistics client, they get an error
   saying there is no license present:
   
   
   >Error # 7001
   >There is no license for IBM SPSS Statistics.
   >Execution of this command stops.
   >Specific symptom number: 18
   
   When the reality is that all of the licensed client tokens are
   already in use and the error should be:
   
      Feature 1200 - IBM SPSS Statistics:
       Unable to acquire a license token due to error 4...
         There is a network license, but all the tokens are in use.
         Specific symptom:  306
