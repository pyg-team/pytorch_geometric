Text:
informix; poll thread; nettype TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have configured to have 60 poll threads, but Informix Dynamic Server only starts 50 poll threads and the following message is in online log:

16:10:10 Warning: Number of poll threads for nettype soctcp has already reached the maximum (50). Poll threads which exceed the maximum number will not be started.

Is there a limit on the number of poll threads for every nettype? 

ANSWER
Yes, the number of poll threads for each nettype has a limit of maximum 50 regardless of running on CPU virtual processor or NET virtual processor.
