QUESTION
 Why is a table marked "unavailable" in the db2diag.log with a "ADM5570W"? 

CAUSE
For example, entry in the db2diag.log as follows:
MESSAGE : ADM5570W Access was attempted on an unavailable object with
id "13" in tablespace "3" for table "db2inst1.EMPLOYEE". If the
object is a table it will have to be dropped. If the object is a
partition it will have to be detached. If the object is a non-partitioned
index the index will have to be dropped.


ANSWER
The most common reason why tables are put in a "unavailable state" is likely due to a table being created using NOT LOGGED INITIALLY and during a rollforward attempt, the table will be marked as such. 

Quoting the following: "If the rollforward operation encounters a table that was created or altered with the NOT LOGGED INITIALLY option, the table is marked as unavailable. After the database is recovered, any attempt to access the table returns SQL1477N."
