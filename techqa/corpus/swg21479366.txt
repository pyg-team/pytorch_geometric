Title: IBM Unrecognzed text error in SPSS CONJOINT - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm trying to run a conjoint analysis with SPSS, and am getting the following error message:

Unrecognized text appears where end of subcommand (slash) was expected.
This command is not executed.

I don't understand why I'm getting the error. What might be causing it? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
CONJOINT does not seem to accept specification of file reference paths that span multiple lines using a plus sign, as some other SPSS procedures will allow. Make sure your file references are on the same line and this may eliminate this error
