 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am attempting to install SPSS for Windows in Windows 2000/XP within Safe Mode. When I initiate the install, I encounter the following error:

The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed. This can occur if you are running Windows in safe mode, or if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed. Contact your support personnel for assistance.

How can I install in Safe Mode? 

ANSWER
Download the file '56674.zip' attached to the resolution.

In normal mode, log-in with an administrator account and extract the batch file, 56674.bat, to any location. Double-click the batch file. Reboot the machine in Safe Mode and install SPSS for Windows.

Alternatively, you can run the System Configuration Utility (msconfig.exe) and choose to boot into "Diagnostic Startup".

NOTE: The System Configuation Utility is installed with Windows XP only. Windows 2000 users will need to obtain msconfig.exe from a Windows XP computer.

1. Go to Start->Run and type "msconfig".
2. On the "General" tab, choose "Diagnostic Startup - load basic devices and services only"
3. Click the "Services" tab.
4. Check "Windows Installer" and click OK.
5. Reboot the machine normally and install SPSS for Windows
