APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the MS SQL Agent db_password is configured using the TEP,
   the
   password is written with DES encryption rather than AES256.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   Setup Windows Domain user as administrator on all machines.
   Install TEMS 6.2.2 FP3 on Windows box A.
   Install TEP 6.2.2 FP3  on Windows box B.
   Install TEMA 6.2.2 FP3 on Windows 2003 Server Endpoint
   Add MS SQL Agent 6.2.1 to TEMS Depot
   Execute "Add Managed System" on TEP
   Specify MS SQL Server Password as "abcd"
   Examine the MS SQL Agent configuration file on TEMA.
   Observe that the db_password text is preceeded by the string DES
   and not
   AES256.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Wrong password type is used on a 64-bit machine.
   
   When configuring the MSSQL agent via remote deploy, the 64-bit
   version of the cryptographic routines are used with the 32-bit
   agent and the MSSQL agent configuration fails.  The problem
   occurs on a 64-bit Windows system running a 64-bit NT agent and
   a 32-bit MSSQL Server agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been added to make sure that the correct cryptographic
   routines are always invoked.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0006
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Only run 64-bit agents on 64-bit Windows or do not use remote
   deploy to configure 32-bit agents on 64-bit Windows.
