ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Input sql:
   SELECT *
     FROM GP AS G
     JOIN GP_FELD AS GP
       ON GP.GP = G.GP
     JOIN GF_FELDER AS GF
       ON GF.FKZ = GP.FKZ
      AND GF.FZ  = GP.FZ
   we get the following error:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of DB2 Explain stored procedure        *

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Explain stored procedure DSNAEXP    *
   *                      does not qualify objects properly       *
   *                      for an explicit inner join using the    *
   *                      JOIN keyword.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Explain stored procedure does not qualify objects properly
   for an explicit inner join using the JOIN keyword when the
   stored procedure parameter PARSE equals 'Y'.  If INNER JOIN is
   used, the object is properly qualified.
   For example:
   SELECT *
     FROM GP AS G
     JOIN GP_FD AS GP
       ON GP.GP = G.GP
     JOIN GF_FD AS GF
       ON GF.FK = GP.FK
      AND GF.FZ  = GP.FZ
   
   The objects GP_FD and GF_FD are not properly qualified with the
   QUALIFIER stored procedure input parameter.
   
   Additional Keywords:
   SQLEXPLAIN VISUAL EXPLAIN DSNAEXP DSN8EXP
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been fixed to properly qualify objects for
   an inner join using the JOIN keyword.
