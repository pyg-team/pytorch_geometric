APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With channel statistics enabled on a SVRCONN channel with a
   channel exit in place and using the
   async consume feature (i.e. SHARECNV > 0 on MQ MQ 7.5 or
   SHARECNV > 1 on MQ 8.0 and higher MQ versions),
   the amqrmppa process crashes with a memory exception.
   
   The issue does not occur if a channel exit is not in place and
   channel
   statistics are enabled or if a channel exit is in place and
   channel statistics are not enabled.

LOCAL FIX
 *  If channel statistics are enabled, set the STATCHL to off on
   the queue manager definition. Restart all channels which were
   affected by the change.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using SVRCONN channels with an exit, the async consume
   feature and channel statistics.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This problem occurred because the IBM MQ channel asynchronous
   consumer thread was trying to reference the
   channel status table with an invalid pointer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ code has been modified to ensure the channel status
   table access is available before attempting to reference the
   channel status table.
