APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Confirmation reminders created pre-v6 have incorrect text in
   email subjects when upgraded to v6.0.3.
   
   Instead of, say, [Urgent Reminder #3] showing up in the email
   subject, [null3] is showing up.
   
   This is only happening for pre-v6 hold notice confirmation
   reminders that have not been upgraded. v6 notices work
   properly, and virtual interview reminders work fine.
