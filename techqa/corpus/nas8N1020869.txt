QUESTION
 How the QBRMSYNC job Works 

ANSWER
In the BRMS System Policy there is a setting called "Shared inventory delay". The default setting is 60 seconds.
The Q1ARNET program wakes up based on the Shared inventory delay and if it sees changes in the journal it will build records in the QA1ANET2 file which contains a list of systems that need to be called and the file that needs to be altered on that system. It then submits the QBRMSYNC job and goes back to sleep.
