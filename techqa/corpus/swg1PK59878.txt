APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a major disaster, all CICS regions were down and
   CF structures deallocated.
     CICSVR forward recovery failed with message
   .
   DWW0566S Browse of MVS log stream CICS.CICSEWF1.J04 failed.
    The return code is 00000008 and the reason code is 00000861
    The answer area contains:  00000028000000000000000000000000
               000000000401000100000000000000000000000000000000.
   .
      The Return and Reason codes are found in manual
    z/OS V1R8 MVS Authorized Assembler Services Reference EDT-IXG
   for the IXGBROWSE.  RC8 RSN861 means that the operating system
   responded with DUPLEXING IN PROGRESS.
   CICS/VR terminates processing.
   .
     When the CICSVR recovery utility starts its batch job,
   the first thing it does is IXGBROWSE on a logstream.
   Because all of the CICS regions are down,
   all of the structures are deallocated.
     The structure would naturally be empty.
   To read a logstream, the structure, the MVS dataspace and the
   journalled logstreams to DASD are all one logical logstream.
   All must be available to do an IXGBROWSE.
     Usually the structure is already there.
   Since they are not,  XCF initiates a structure build.
   If the structure is specified as DUPLEX(ENABLED),
   XCF immediately duplexes the newly-allocated structure.
   IXGLOGR returns a RC=08 REASON CODE -861.
   CICS/VR fails the recovery job.
   .
     Since there are no active connectors against the structure,
   CICS/VR will be the first connector every time. This will
   cause the structure rebuild and start to duplex every time.
   So, RC08 RSN861 will be returned every time.
     The solution would be to wait for one second then retry
   the request once more, up to a maximum of 60 attempts
   before allowing the job to fail
   .

LOCAL FIX
 *  Start a CICS region
   Do an OPEN to a RECOVERABLE file.
   This drives the specific structure that needs to be allocated
   and duplexed.  But it will not initiate a BROWSE, or UDATE
   because no applications will be running.
    With CICS up and the structure allocated,
   the recovery job will work.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects CICSVR 4.1 and 4.2 users   *
   *                 that use log streams allocated on structures *
   *                 specified as DUPLEX(ENABLE).                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If CF structures is deallocated, CICSVR *
   *                      forward recovery fails with message     *
   *                      DWW0566S.                               *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If IXGLOGR returns a REASON CODE from 860 to 8CF, CICSVR will
   wait for one second and then retry the request once more and
   will keep repeating the request after one second.
