ABSTRACT
 The documentation for PBG NUMPARTS value 'DEFINED' on panel ADB2GEN needs to be clarified to account for the case in which NUMPARTS was not used when the tablespace was originally created. 

CONTENT
 The explanation of the PBG NUMPARTS value 'Defined' should read as follows:

Defined

The NUMPARTS clause will be generated
with the value used when the table 
space was created. If NUMPARTS was 
not specified in the DDL when the table space
was created, the value that is generated
in the DDL will be the number of 
partitions that DB2 initially creates
- all having the same created 
timestamp in the DB2 catalog (column 
CREATEDTS in table SYSIBM.SYSTABLEPART).
