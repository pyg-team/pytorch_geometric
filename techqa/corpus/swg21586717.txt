Title: IBM Reduce the full execution trace that is stored for Decision Warehouse - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you reduce the full execution trace that is stored for Decision Warehouse? 

CAUSE
A lot of information is stored in the field FULL_EXECUTION_TRACE. Over time, when running thousands of executions, the execution trace data will take up too much space in the database. 

ANSWER
Full execution trace can consume a lot of space depending on the size of the ruleset. One recommended way is to apply filters on rulesets to optimize the storage of the execution trace data: 

WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Rule Studio > Testing, validating, and auditing rules > Configuring and customizing Decision Warehouse > Optimizing Decision Warehouse [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global733.html] 

Deciding on which **filters to apply is subject to the requirements of each application. If you set the monitoring.filters property, the Decision Warehouse stores only the trace information enabled by the filters that you have set to true. 

In a scenario where you have over 5000 rules within a ruleset and that only 10% of these rules are fired, if you have activated both INFO_TOTAL_RULES_FIRED and INFO_TOTAL_RULES_NOT_FIRED to true, all the rules (fired and not fired) will be logged. You may consider setting INFO_TOTAL_RULES_NOT_FIRED=false to reduce the data on the rules not fired. This greatly reduces the data stored. 

Another possible filter can be INFO_TASKS_NOT_EXECUTED=false. 

*For reducing execution traces logged by DVS, refer to this technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438208]instead. 

**Note that in the V7.1 documentation, there is a missing filter INFO_EXECUTION_DATE that provides the execution start date. It is showed in the V7.5 documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.5.0/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_ruleset_filters.html] and on, but can be used in V7.1 too
