Title: IBM Replacing or updating a WSDL attached to a Web Service Proxy - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You uploaded your modified WSDL to File Management as a way to update the Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy) but these WSDL changes did not take effect. 

CAUSE
Once a WSDL has been compiled and attached to a WS-Proxy, DataPower will not recompile it unless a WSDL Cache Policy is being used or the WSDL is detached from the WS-Proxy and then reattached.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following steps should be followed when updating a WSDL attached to a WS-Proxy: 

 1. Ensure all configuration changes have been saved. By doing this, your configuration changes will be persisted should the device reboot or reload. 
 2. Remove the WSDL to be updated from the WS-Proxy configuration. This can be done from the WebGUI using these steps:  1. Click Control Panel 
     2. Click on Web Service Proxy 
     3. Click to edit the appropriate WS-Proxy 
     4. Remove the appropriate WSDL from the list of configured WSDLs displayed. 
     5. Click Apply and Save the configuration changes you just made
    
    
 3. From the Configure Web Service Proxy screen, click Add WSDL to add the updated WSDL. 
 4. Upload the modified WSDL to the appropriate directory and use the Overwrite Existing File option if needed 
 5. Click Next to continue with the configuration of the WS-Proxy using the updated WSDL. 
 6. Complete the WS-Proxy configuration and review the added WSDL to see if it contains the changes made.
