Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After configuring Box as a repository for Case Manager, Case Client users would like to delete documents and/or folders created under the Box collaboration folder. There does not appear to be any mechanism to perform this deletion. 

ANSWER
There is no support for deleting documents and/or folders from a Box Collaboration folder created via Case Manager at this time. Case workers who created the Box collaboration folder will have Viewer/Uploader permission on the Box Collaboration folder, and therefore, will not be able to delete content within a Box collaboration folder as this may result in missing data in the associated cases. Users who are invited to collaborate on the Box collaboration folder have the same restriction.
