 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am trying to install BIM SPSS Statistics Client and more importantly, the latest version of the SafeNet Sentinel License Manager tool on my machine. I have installed everything in the \Windows\Administration\Licensing\NetworkLicenseManager and \Tools folder of my Statistics media.

Because of Firewall and Security issues, I cannot obtain a licence automatically and I have been asked by the Business Analytics Client Care team for my lock code so they can manually generate a licence code to be applied onto my machine. When I run the 'echoid.exe' application (to obtain the lock code), I receive the following: 10-*1TR JYAF UQEJ VUHK

Licencing states that this is an incorrect format and that it should appear similar to the following example:
E.g. 10-ABC12 

ANSWER
There are two examples on where this type of lock code will appear.

1) The 'echoid.exe' application was run from an incorrect location. You'll need to execute this tool from the \WinNT subdirectory of the Safenet Sentinel License Manager.

2) The version of the Safenet Sentinel License Manager was installed on a Unix/Linux system. This is an example of the updated Sentinel License Manager's lock code application. You'll see that the above lock code is listed as a 'NEW' machine lock code format. Unfortunately, IBM SPSS cannot generate valid licences from the new lock code format.

Please uninstall the current Safenet Sentinel License Manager and download and install the version available from the IBM SPSS Technical Support website.

Once a proper lock code has been obtained, please see resolution 73187 for instructions on how to successfully licence your Sentinel License Manager
