APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0.1 and your data
   file includes a variable with Czech characters in it's value
   labels. You use this variable as BREAK variable in an AGGREGATE
   syntax command.
   The syntax performs well. You then close the aggregated data set
   and run the same AGGREGATE command for the original data set a
   second time.
   This time the Czech characters in the value labels of the BREAK
   variable are no longer properly displayed in Data View and
   Variable View of Data Editor. The characters are replaced with
   question marks. However, when you run a frequency table for the
   break variable in the aggregated data set is displayed with the
   correct Czech characters.
