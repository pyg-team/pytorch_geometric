APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  One day difference between WebGui date ranges & CSV
   import and export does not take time zone of user into account:
   
   The start date and the end date of a date range are stored as a
   combined date and time representation that follows the ISO 8601
   standard, that is, in the format YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00+/-hh:mm,
   where +/-hh:mm reflects the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
   offset. In the user interface, date ranges in data
   requests have, up to now, been shown according to the time zone
   of the browser that you use to work with StoredIQ for Legal.
   The dates have been displayed without a time. So, if a user in
   Germany set a start date or an end date of 20 July 2017, it was
   stored as 2017-07-20T00:00:00:00+02:00.
   However, while users located in the same time zone or in a time
   zone east of Germany saw 20 July 2017, users located in a time
   zone west of Germany saw 19 July 2017.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   * Users of StoredIQ for Legal v2.0.3.1
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * StoredIQ for Legal v2.0.3.1 stores dates and times in a UTC
   * format including time zone information. On GUI input, the
   * time zone information for date ranges in a data request is
   * taken from the GUI's browser instance. In 2.0.3.1, when
   * rendering a date range, time zone translation according to
   * the user's browser instance took place and users in
   * different time zones might have seen different dates with time
   * zone information not explicitly shown.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been updated to fix the problem.
   In V2.0.3.2, date range dates continue to be stored in UTC
   format. However, when rendering such a date to the browser, no
   time zone translation takes place. Instead, the time zone with
   which the date was created is shown in the date range control.
   
   To ensure that all StoredIQ for Legal users see the same date
   ranges in data requests, regardless of the time zone of their
   browsers, the user interface shows the start date and the end
   date as they were set, plus the UTC offset that represents the
   time zone of that user who set the dates.
   This means that if a German user selects 20 July 2017 as start
   date, all StoredIQ for Legal users now see 20 July 2017
   (UTC+2:00) as date notation.
   In addition, the end dates of date ranges are stored with a
   time setting of 23:59:59 to indicate the end of the day.
   Existing end dates, which were set before the fix is
   applied, are not changed.
