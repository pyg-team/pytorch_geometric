Title: IBM File not found when installing RaPM - United States

Text:
install error missing launchpad.sh manually manual installing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of Tivoli Integrated Portal component fails when IBM Security Role and Policy Modeler is not installed using the launchpad.sh script. 

SYMPTOM
The installation XML log file shows this error: 

<class>com.ibm.security.modeling.installer.middleware.panels.TipPanel.15</class>
<method>widgetSelected</method>
<message> Exception occured while :/tmp/TIP_Path_for_Rapm_Installer.txt (No such file or directory)</message>


CAUSE
The launchpad.sh script creates the file "TIP_Path_for_Rapm_Installer.txt". If launchpad.sh is not used to start the installer, this file will not exist and the installation will fail.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two options to resolve this problem: 

1. If launchpad.sh will not run due to it not finding a supported browser, please refer to the linked technote below for details on how to update the launchpad.sh script to work with later versions of Firefox. 

 

2. If launchpad.sh still doesn't work, or fails for some other reason, then you can create the file manually. Before running the RaPM installer, use these steps to create the text file:
a. touch /tmp/TIP_Path_for_Rapm_Installer.txt
b. Using a text editor, e.g. vi, open that file to add this line:

TIPLocation=<Temp directory where you extracted the installer file>/disk1//

c. Save and close the file
d. Start the Installation Manager to install RaPM
