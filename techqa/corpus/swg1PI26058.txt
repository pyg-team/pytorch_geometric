APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When loading the EditLive editor for the first time on any rich
   text element or component field (ie: switch to the Design or
   Code view), the following exception is thrown
   within the SystemOut log:
   
   ExceptionLogg W com.ibm.wps.logging.ExceptionLogger
   logThrowable(th)
   An exception occurred: [EJCBD0021E: The URI
   [spa:Z6_00000000000000A0BR2B300EO0/html/inserthtml.xml] and
   parameters [['pragma'=['cache']]] could not be processed:
   [EJPEI0088E: The resource [inserthtml.xml] could not be
   found.]].
   Enable traces for [com.ibm.wps.logging.ExceptionLogger=all] to
   see the exception stack trace.
   
   Other than the exception message itself, the editor still
   functions correctly without any issues.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Modify the EditLive editor configuration file (config.xml.jsp)
   and remove references to the inserthtml plugin.
   
   ie: remove the following line from the config file
   <plugin name="insertHTML" />
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When loading the EditLive editor for the first time on any rich
   text element or component field (ie: switch to the Design or
   Code view), the following exception is thrown within the
   SystemOut log:
   
   ExceptionLogg W com.ibm.wps.logging.ExceptionLogger
   logThrowable(th)
   An exception occurred: [EJCBD0021E: The URI
   [spa:Z6_00000000000000A0BR2B300EO0/html/inserthtml.xml] and
   parameters [['pragma'=['cache']]] could not be processed:
   [EJPEI0088E: The resource [inserthtml.xml] could not be
   found.]].
   Enable traces for [com.ibm.wps.logging.ExceptionLogger=all] to
   see the exception stack trace.
   
   Other than the exception message itself, the editor still
   functions correctly without any issues.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The insertHTML plugin no longer exists in the recent editor
   update and Ephox has removed the plugin and integrated this to
   the core editor. References to the invalid plugin has been
   removed from the default editor config file.
   
   For customers using a custom editor configuration, references to
   the inserthtml plugin needs to be manually removed.
