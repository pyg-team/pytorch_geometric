Title: IBM MonitorPolicies.xml file not updated - United States

Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following error is seen in get_policies.updated.DOMAIN.trace:
critical: Access to /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/etc/precision/DbLogins.DOMAIN required. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These updates happen automatically and a trace will exist to troubleshoot in 

$NCHOME/log/precision/get_policies.updated.DOMAIN.trace 

Look for a critical message in this trace file like
critical: Access to /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/etc/precision/DbLogins.DOMAIN required.

create the necessary DbLogins file, which might only be a copy of DbLogins.cfg, but make sure it is named DbLogins.DOMAIN.cfg.

Make another GUI change so that it will try to write the file again to 
$NCHOME/var/precision.
