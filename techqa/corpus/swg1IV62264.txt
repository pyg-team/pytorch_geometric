ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Our customer reports the following issue with ISIM V 6:
   
   When DB2 or LDAP is down and when you try to login into ISIM via
   http://hostname:9080/itim/console/jsp/logon/Login.jsp you get an
   error message, which says password is wrong. This has caused a
   lot of confusion at our customer. The system admin on duty did
   not see, that the problem was with LDAP or DB2 but suspected
   the problem was caused by a wrong password enterd by the user.
   The message reported is:
   
   CTGIMU534E
   Login authentication failure occurred. The specified user ID and
   password are not valid, have expired, or have been disabled.
   
   Close Message
   
   The documentation IBM Security Identity Manager
   6.0.0.2>Messages>User interface messages tells:
   Explanation The login failed because the user ID, password, or
   both are not valid.
   User response Ensure that the user ID and password are valid and
   try again. If the login attempts continue to fail, contact your
   help desk representative or system administrator for assistance.
   
   This is misleading as the cause of the issue is not the one
   within the error message.
   
   The ITIM V 5.1 system reacts as follows to a logon when LDAP was
   down:
   
   CTGIMU563E
   The specified user ID and password are not valid.
   
   CTGIMM102E
   The directory server is not available.
   
   Close Message
   
   Here it is clear, that the issue is LDAP and not a wrongly
   entered password and the response of the cust's system admin
   targets the real problem at once.
   
   I have checked this in our test environment and it behaves as
   described by our customer.
   
   Our customer requests, that ISIM V 6 shall throw a meaningful
   error message in the given situation as ITIM V 5.1 does.
