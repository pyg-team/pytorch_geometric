APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The behavior is originally consistent with TMWeb, but it confuse
   the customer:
   When user check "Show scanner settings" option, then scan some
   files, in this case, "Show scanner settings" unchecked
   automatically.
   So I refine the behavior: Anything that the user can change on
   the tab is expected to be remembered the next time the Scanner
   is run, if the Save button is pressed.
