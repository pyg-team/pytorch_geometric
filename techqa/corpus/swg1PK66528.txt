APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To resolve StaleConnectionException exceptions, you can view
   the "Example: Handling data access exception -
   StaleConnectionException" topic in the Information Centers for
   WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.1 and 6.0.x. This
   topic contains sample code that shows how to address the
   exception in the code for a business application. However, the
   topic does not explain how to resolve the problem when you are
   using an integrated development environment (IDE), such as
   Eclipse. When you use an IDE, such as Eclipse, you might need
   to import the libraries that are used by WebSphere Application
   Server into the IDE.

   If you use the sample code in the "Example: Handling data
   access exception - StaleConnectionException" topic, you must
   import the Java archive (JAR) files, which are located in
   app_server_root /plugins directory for V6.1 or the
   app_server_root /lib directory for V6.0.x. These JAR files are
   needed to successfully compile and implement the samples that
   are provided. Integrated development environments (IDE), such
   as Eclipse, do not automatically import the libraries that the
   Application Server employs. Thus, you must import the
   libraries so that the IDE can resolve references and ensure
   the integrity of the sample code.
   
   The "Example: Handling data access exception -
   StaleConnectionException" topic within the V6.1 and V6.0.x
   
   documentation does not indicate that you might need to import
   these libraries into the IDE for the code to function properly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Example: Handling data access exception -
   StaleConnectionException" topic will be updated to include the
   following version-specific note:
   
   Version 6.1:
   "Avoid trouble: If you are developing applications for the
   Application Server with an integrated development environment
   (IDE) like Eclipse, you might need to import the
   app_server_root/plugins/com.ibm.ws.runtime.jar file into the
   development environment to take advantage of code that is
   provided."
   
   Version 6.0.x:
   "Avoid trouble: If you are developing applications for the
   Application Server with an integrated development environment
   (IDE) like Eclipse, you might need to import the
   app_server_root/lib/util.jar file into the development
   environment to take advantage of code that is provided."
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the September
   2008 update to the information centers.
