Title: IBM Rule Team Server admin user is missing links on the Configure tab - United States

Text:
security; group; user; role; configure TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Rule Team Server (RTS) admin user does not have the "Installation Manager" and "Erase Current Project" links on the "Configure" tab. 

SYMPTOM
See attached screenshot.


CAUSE
The RTS admin user (rtsAdmin by default) is not mapped to the rtsInstaller role.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that your RTS admin user belongs to a group that is mapped to both the rtsAdministrator andrtsInstaller roles.


The section "Installing on XYZ > Installing Rule Team Server > Installing Rule Team Server on XYZ> Configuring security on XYZ" of the JRules 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC136.html] gives examples of users/groups where the group names happen to match the RTS mandatory role names (rtsAdministrator,rtsConfigManager,rtsInstaller, and rtsUser). However, the user/group names you have in your user registry can be different, because only their mapping to the required RTS roles, which gives your users access to the RTS functionality, matters. 

 

Refer to the vendor's documentation for more information on how the group/role mapping is performed in the application server you use. 

 

For example, in WebSphere, the mapping is performed in the Administrative Console when (or after) you deploy the RTS EAR (see 'Step 9' in section "WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1: Java EE add-ons > Installing on WebSphere Application Server > Installing Rule Team Server > Installing Rule Team Server on WebSphere Application Server V7.0 > Deploying the Rule Team Server EAR on WebSphere V7.0" of the JRules 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC141.html]).
