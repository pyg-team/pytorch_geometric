APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The documentation should include the following information:
   
   When generating a JAX-WS Web Service from a class file that depe
   nds on other classes contained in separate jar files, the projec
   t needs to reference such external jar files either from the Jav
   a EE Module Dependencies or from User Libraries.
   
   Using Java EE Module dependnecies is possible when the  jars are
    contained in the EAR project.
   
   In the case where the jars are part of a Shared Library configur
   ed on WebSphere Application Server,
   then a User Library must be used to configure the project for de
   velopment before generating the WebService.
   
   To add a user library to the project:
   1. Go to the project properties ? Java Build Path ? Libraries
   2. Click add Library ? User Library ? User Libraries
   3. Create a user library, and add your utility jar to it.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The customer may not know they need to use User Libraries or
   Java EE Module Dependencies when generating JAX-WS Web
   Services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The JAX-WS bottom-up documentation has had the following
   restriction added to it:
   
   When generating a JAX-WS Web service from a class file that
   depends on other classes contained in separate jar files,
   the project needs to reference such external jar files
   either from the Java EE Module Dependencies or from User
   Libraries. Using Java EE Module dependencies is possible
   when the jars are contained in the EAR project.
   
   In the case where the jars are part of a Shared Library
   configured on WebSphere Application Server, then a User
   Library must be used to configure the project for
   development before generating the Web service. To add a user
   library to the project:
   Right-click the project and click Properties ? Java Build
   Path ? Libraries
   Click Add Library ? User Library ? User Libraries
   Create a user library, and add your utility jar to it.
