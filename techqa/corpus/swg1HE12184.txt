APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Manager
   service performs synchronization between the configuration host
   and the configuration backup host, and the communication is
   interrupted, the service on the configuration host ends up in an
    invalid final state. This might happen, for example, when the
   server is unexpectedly rebooted.
   
   As a result, the configuration backup host is unable to
   synchronize further with the configuration host.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Manager
   service on the configuration host.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If communication between the configuration host and the
   configuration backup host is interrupted when configuration data
    is being synchronized, the IBM Content Configuration Store
   Manager service on the configuration host will be left in the
   ConfigHostSynchronizing state. This is not a valid final state.
   In this state, the service is unable to respond to any events
   other than the completion of the synchronization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the communication failed error event occurs during
   synchronization, the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store
   Manager service on the configuration host will now switch to the
    ConfigHostPrimaryAlone state. In this state, the service is
   able to respond to the connection events that are fired if and
   when the configuration backup host makes an attempt to create a
   host standby connection.
   
   Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0 Fix Pack 3, the
   Configuration Store Manager service on the configuration host
   will not end up in an invalid state.
