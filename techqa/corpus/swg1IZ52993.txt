   See SB.
   
   
   Recreate Steps
   
    Set up event source(s) on an endpoint in a busy or otherwise
   overloaded
   GW/Endpoint environment.
   Add a sleep() call to the EIF code
   Attempt to send events until an upcall failure occurs (lcfd.log)
   Monitor for event duplication in the cache files
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Balance the endpoint load on the FW gateway's to lessen the
   possibility of endpoint upcall failures .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Any Tivoli products, such as ITM 5.x, that use
   * the libtecgw.a EIF library.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Duplicate events appear at the TEC Server
   * when using State Correlation and interconnected TMRs.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: New EIF libraries can be found in the
   * maintenance vehicle listed below.  ITM will need to link
   * with the new libraries in order to provide a fix for the
   * problem.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The libtecgw.a EIF libraries in the EIFSDK have been updated so
   that events will not be duplicated.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
