KMQW000W 2035 Not Authorized Queue Messages QACCESS USEQACCESS 5724K3500TR TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do you get the "(KMQW000W)2035-Not Authorized" error in the Queue Messages workspace? 

CAUSE
The MQ Monitoring agent tries to access the queue messages information for the selected queue with the TEP user id which does not have the required mqm authority on agent host.

ANSWER
You can use the MSGACCESS parameter (at the QMGR and GROUP level) and SET QACCESS monitoring settings in the agent cfg file so that access to the WMQ Messages is granted accordingly. 

 
Please refer to ITCAM/OMEGAMON XE for MQ Monitoring Agent User Guide for details regarding the SET QACCESS statement.

For example, the below MSGACCESS and SET QACCESS settings uses MQAGENT authority to access MQ Messages in all queue. And with 'MSGACCESS(DELETE)', any TEP user has full access to queue messages including DELETE.
