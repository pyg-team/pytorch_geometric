REMEDIATION/FIXES
GPFS server or client instances deployed with the affected GPFS Pattern versions are vulnerable. To determine whether deployed GPFS server or client instances are affected by these GPFS security vulnerabilities, run the Get Cluster Status operation ( for a GPFS server instance ) or the GPFS Client Status operation ( for a GPFS client instance ) to verify the version reported for the GPFS nodes. 

The solution is to apply the following interim fix:

GPFS 4.1.1.5
