APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR refers to the session suspend resume feature of
   WebSphere Portal. If this feature is active, the portal server
   will save the navigational state of a user into the portal
   database when he/she finishes his/her session.
   
   If this data is migrated to a newer release of WebSphere
   Portal, the new system might have issues with decoding it
   during session resume. The page rendering fails completely in
   this case.
   
   If the default theme is used, the page rendering typically
   fails with the following exception:
   
   Uncaught service() exception root cause
   /themes/html/Default.jsp:
   com.ibm.websphere.servlet.error.ServletErrorReport:
   com.ibm.wps.resolver.data.exceptions.URIProcessingIOException:
   
   EJCBD0021E: The URI [dav:fs-type1/themes/Portal8.0/theme.html]
   and parameters ...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  De-activate the session suspend resume feature.
