PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   SMARTEAM.
   The previous behavior of the refreshing of the
   Profile Card has been changed in the R19.
   Currently, the dynamic cache is created on the
   client per view. If an object has already open in the
   specific view, it's data has been created in the
   cache. Next time the system will not retrive the
   data from the database, but will retrieve it from the
   cache. In this case, if the Profile Card of the object
   was updated by another user, the modification will
   not be presented in the view without the refresh
   (F5). This is a restriction to maintan consistance of
   the Data in the Profile Card vs. data in the
   Documents Tree view which refresh only upon
   refresh (F5). This is documented in R19 SP4
   Program Directory.
