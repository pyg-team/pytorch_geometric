Title: IBM Unable to create or edit desktop after upgrade to ICN 3.0.2 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Following an upgrade from IBM Content Navigator (ICN) v2.0.3 to v3.0.2 no desktop can be edited or created, or a desktop setting could be changed but after saving and rechecking, the changes revert back to oringal values. 

SYMPTOM
No error occurs - the action just does nothing. In addition, the ICN ping page still displays the old version of ICN, despite the upgrade being successful.


CAUSE
Residual files are left in the /{root dir}/configure/explodedformat/navigator/web-inf/classes folder and not removed during the initial upgrade attempt.

ENVIRONMENT
ICN v3.0.2

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the installation logs for v3.0.2 to ensure that the upgrade was actually successful.




Check the ICN ping page to see if it displays the correct ICN version.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following steps: 


1) Backup and then delete the following from the web-inf/classes folder:
/com
/netscape
/org
wcversion.properties

2) Once the directories are removed, un-deploy Content Navigator and clear the Websphere cache. 

3) Then run the following ICN Configuration and Deployment steps again:

- Configure the IBM Content Navigator Web Application
- Build the Web Application
- Deploy the Web Application
