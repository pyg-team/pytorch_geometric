QUESTION
 You ran DFHEISUP with the DETAIL option in CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V2.3, and the input card was in the format 'library.name(member)', including the quotes. In CICS TS V3.2 the program does not work with that format for the same input card. However if you change the input card to remove the library.name and the quotes, so that the new format is simply the member name, then this works just fine. Is DFHEISUP from CICS TS V3.2 supposed to behave differently than it did in CICS TS V2.3? 

CAUSE
CICS TS V3.2 manuals did not reflect this change.

ANSWER
Yes, the format is different with CICS TS V3.2. An Electronic Reader's Comment Form has been taken to update the documentation; so depending on what version of documentation you are looking at you might not see this change.

Previously, if you were running with PARM='DETAIL' then the DFHLIST input would need to contain, for example:


 * 
 * 


Now with CICS TS 3.2, if you run with PARM='DETAIL' then within the DFHLIST the input card would need to be just the member name, for example: 

 * 
 * 


If you run DFHEISUP [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha6/topics/dfha693.html] with PARM=('SUMMARY,DETAILMODS') the DFHLIST output only contains the member name, whereas in CICS TS V2.3 it would be in the form 'library.name(member name)'.
