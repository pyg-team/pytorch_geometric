Title: IBM When using a relative path in my syntax, it cannot perform but gives an error. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using a relative path in my syntax. When executing it I receive an error: 

INCLUDE FILE='.\tmp\tmp1.sps'.
Error # 34 in column 14. Text: .\tmp\tmp1.sps
SPSS Statistics cannot access a file with the given file specification. The
file specification is either syntactically invalid, specifies an invalid
drive, specifies a protected directory, specifies a protected file, or
specifies a non-sharable file.
Execution of this command stops.

If I change a relative path into absolute path, I can perform the syntax without any error. In the case of version 15.0, this problem does not happen. I can perform the syntax. I can perform the syntax even if I perform the same steps of version 19. Why is this happenning? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When we switched over to the Java platform, we lost the ability to use existing file structures in our syntax. E.g. In version 15 and earlier, if a dataset was opened in C:\Temp and a Save Outfile was used (WITHOUT specifying the path), then it was saved in C:\Temp.

However in SPSS 16 and later, we need to specifiy exactly where the file will be saved.

Please change the relative path into an absolute path in your syntax file. 
If you want to use a relative path on syntax file, you need to save the syntax file to the folder in which stats.exe exists.
