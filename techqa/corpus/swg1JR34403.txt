APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During the applicaiton installation in WPS 62 cluster
   environment, mapping of both EJB module and Webmodule to
   AppTarget and Webserver creates listener port and callback
   queue. Later uninstalling the application can't able to clean
   these resources.
   The problem happening only in cluster environment and when we
   map both modules to webserver along with Apptarget.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Mapping both modules to AppTarget and not mapping them to
   webserver.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Websphere Process Server v6.2. users who    *
   *                  install applications on multiple            *
   *                  deployment targets.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Un-installation of an application,      *
   *                      mapped to multiple deployment targets,  *
   *                      is not deleting associated resources.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Applications related to Message queue(MQ) bindings create
   numerous resources such as listeners and queues during
   installation. These resources are not automatically deleted
   during uninstallation, if application is mapped to multiple
   deployment targets. Service Component Architecture(SCA) is
   returning incorrect deployment target to  MQ uninstall task
   and hence resources are left uncleaned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A check has been added to SCA layer to iterate over the
   deployment targets and return correct deployment target to MQ
   uninstall task which would then clean up all the MQ resources.
   Apply the ifix to resolve the problem.
