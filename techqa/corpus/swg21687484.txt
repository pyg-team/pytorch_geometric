QUESTION
 After logging into Deployment Manager client, I receive the following error attempting to store Modeler stream files into the repository or even when attempting to view modeler stream files within the repository:



=================================

An error has occurred. See error log for more details.



Unable to create resource

URLImageDescriptor(SERVER_NAME:8080/config/icon/application_x_vnd_spss_clementine_stream_-s.gif)



Ok | Details

================================= 

CAUSE
This error happens when there is some kind of problem with the URL Prefix setting within C&DS.

ANSWER
To validate the URL Prefix setting, first login to the C&DS Deployment Manager web portal using a URL like this: 

YOUR_C&DS_SERVER_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:8080/security/login


Where you use the appropriate C&DS server name or IP address and the appropriate port for your application server. And then select Configuration in the right hand pane, then scroll to the bottom under the section "Setup" and find the setting URL Prefix and click on it. See what the value is set to on the right hand side. 

Typically this error occurs when the URL prefix value is set to something that is unreachable or undefined to the client. So for example if the URL prefix is set to use a computer machine name that the client machine cannot reach or does not know how to resolve that name to an IP address. In which case you could fix the problem by changing the URL prefix value to use a reachable IP address or you could also add an entry in the client hosts file so that the name can be properly resolved to the correct IP address.
