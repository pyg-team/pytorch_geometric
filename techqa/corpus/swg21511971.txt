Title: IBM Unable to use searchForOne operation for IBM FileNet Business Process Manager 4.5.1 - United States

Text:
searchForMany; CM; Operation TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to find a Content Engine document with searchForOne method in CE_Operations return no result when using IBM FileNet Business Process Manager . 

SYMPTOM
Running the search template directly from Workplace XT returned the result as expected, but when the search template is used in CE_Operations searchForOne, the resulting work item showed no document attached.


CAUSE
The first search property within the search template often has an item ID of 1, the second property has an item ID of 2, and so on. However, this is not always true, especially when with search templates that have had many changes. 

For example in screenshot below after updating the Search Template several times, the item id for <whereprop> tag is now at 16. Always check search template and use the correct item id in the searchForOne operation parameters.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Locate the search template within the IBM FileNet Enterprise Manager, right-click, and select Properties. 
 2. Move to the Content tab and click View. 
 3. When prompted for an application to view the content with, select Internet Explorer. 
 4. Look for the itemid in the <whereprop> tag of property name 
 5. Use the itemid in the searchForOne operation parameters
