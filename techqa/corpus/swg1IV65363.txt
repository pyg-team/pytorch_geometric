Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to reproduce the error"
   1) Open the Assets application.
   
   2) In the List tab, filter to show records with a rotating
   item, that are in a location that is of type STOREROOM. (In the
   demo database, we can use Location HARDWARE and Rotating Item
   D600)
   
   3) Click the Move/Modify Assets button. Note that in the
   Move/Modify Assets window, there are no values entered for To
   Location, To GL Account, To Parent, or To Bin.
   
   4) Navigate to the Attributes tab. Open the Modify All subtab.
   Enter an attribute that is applicable for all listed assets, as
   well as a new specification value for that attribute. (In the
   example given in the demo database, we use Attibute RAMSIZE and
   Numeric Value 1024). Click OK.
   
   5) The error BMXAA0122E - Cannot move rotating asset from an
   inventory location. Issue or transfer the rotating asset from
   an inventory location is displayed. This is a valid error if we
   were moving the asset, but the To Location field is null, per
   step 1. Users should be able to apply specification data
   without receiving this error.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When modifying attributes in the Move/Modify Assets dialog,  *
   * error "BMXAA0122E - Cannot move rotating asset from an       *
   * inventory location. Issue or transfer the rotating asset     *

   * not make sense since the assets are not actually changing    *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fix implemented so that users can apply new specification
   attribute values in the Move/Modify Assets dialog without
   receiving the erroneous "BMXAA0122E - Cannot move rotating asset
   from an inventory location. Issue or transfer the rotating asset
   from an inventory location" message.
