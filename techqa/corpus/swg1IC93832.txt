APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an HTTPRequest node is configured with a security profile,
   then the https:// calls made by the HTTPRequest node fail with
   this error:
   
   BIP3165S - error during SSL-Socketoperation. Operation:
   'setSSLOptions'. error text: 'java.io.FileNotFoundException:
   Reserved for future use (file or directory not found).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 or IBM Integration
   Bus V9.0 with the HTTPRequest node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   If an HTTPRequest node is configured with a security profile,
   then the https:// calls made by the HTTPRequest node fail with
   error BIP3165S.
   
   BIP3165S - error during SSL-Socketoperation. Operation:
   'setSSLOptions'. error text: 'java.io.FileNotFoundException:
   Reserved for future use (file or directory not found).
   
   When a security profile is configured, the HTTPRequest node
   tries to get the keystore file name from the security profile.
   The default value of the keystore file name in every security
   profile will be the value 'Reserved for future use' and that
   is the reason why the error text says
   java.io.FileNotFoundException: Reserved for future use (file
   or directory not found).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now works as expected when https:// calls are made
   with the HTTPRequest node.
