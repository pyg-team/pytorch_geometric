APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After you manually change the Oracle database URLs for the IBM
   Business Process Manager (BPM) data sources instead of using the
   "BPMConfig -update -dataSource" command and the database name
   (service name or system ID) in the customized URL uses a
   different capitalization than was originally used in the
   configuration properties file, you receive a
   NullPointerException like the following example when running the
   "BPMConfig -validate" command (or when using the Health Center
   in the WebSphere administrative console):

   )
    at com.ibm.bpm.config.BPMConfig.main(BPMConfig.java:293)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually update the Oracle database name in the IBM BPM data
   source URLs to exactly match their capitalization in the
   cell-bpm.xml file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Oracle database name (service name or system ID) is stored
   in two different configuration files. The validation code did a
   case-sensitive comparison of the database names when searching
   for data sources and, therefore, couldn't match database names
   with different capitalization. Not finding a required data
   source caused a NullPointerException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be available in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.03
   that updates the validation code to match Oracle database names
   in a case insensitive manner.
