APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  READMEs of interim fixes and fixpacks containing UNIX OS agent
   APAR IV51784 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV51784] do not warn about the need of running the DB2
   tablespace upgrade SQL scripts. This is necessary because of a
   set of new attributes introduced by this APAR into the System
   attribute group that make the warehouse tables for this group
   cross the 4k tablespace boundary.
   
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This issue affects UNIX OS Agent 6.22 FP9 IF6 and IF7, 6.23 FP5
   and 6.30 FP3
   
   Diagnostics: Errors in Summarization & Pruning agent like this
   one:
   
     SQL                : ALTER TABLE "ITMUSER"."System_H" ADD
   "LAT_System_Software_Version" VARCHAR (96)
     template SQL       :
   == 11154 t=work2 SQLException occured. SQL State = 54010 , SQL
   Error Code = -670
   == 11155 t=work2 com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlException: The row
   length of the table exceeded a limit of "4005" bytes. (Table
   space "USERSPACE1".).
   
   Initial Impact:
   High, summarized System tables in the warehouse are empty
   
   Additional Keywords: UNIXOS
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the kux_61migr_System_NN.sql scripts as described in:
   "Appendix A. Upgrading for warehouse summarization" of the UNIX
   OS Agent User's Guide.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: Missing information related to warehouse
    upgrade SQL scripts in APAR IV51784 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV51784]
   
   Problem/Problem Summary:
    There is the need of running the DB2 tablespace upgrade SQL
    scripts before applying APAR IV51784 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV51784]. This is necessary
    because of a set of new attributes introduced by this APAR
    into the KUX System attribute group that make the summarized
    warehouse tables for this group cross the 4k tablespace
    boundary. This is not documented in the APAR text, nor in the
    Interim Fixes that contain it.
