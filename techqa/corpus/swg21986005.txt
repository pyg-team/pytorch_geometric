Title: IBM Guardium Report always shows 'MySQL CLIENT' or "MySQL ODBC CLIENT" as 'SOURCE PROGRAM' - United States

Text:
Guardium; mysql client; mysql odbc client; source_program TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does my Guardium report always show 'MySQL CLIENT' or "MySQL ODBC CLIENT" as 'SOURCE PROGRAM' for any MySQL client tool, e.g. RazorSQL, Toad, etc. Why doesn't it show the specific MySQL client tool name as 'SOURCE PROGRAM'? 

CAUSE
MySQL is one of many protocols that do not include the Client/Source Program in the client connection to the database. There is nowhere that Guardium can pick up the exact Source Program from.

ANSWER
Because of the above reason, based on the behavior of protocol, the best Guardium is able to determine is "MySQL CLIENT" or "MySQL ODBC CLIENT" as 'SOURCE PROGRAM'. This is the expected behavior.
