ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Composite Application databases located on a slow-accessible
   server
   When I open some composite application databases and want to
   start an
   action I open the databases and click on the then-visible
   Actions menu
   (this menu item is not visible if a database is not selected on
   the
   Notes workspace). The first entry that is visible (and the only
   one) is
   "Edit application" (which would bring up the Composite
   Application
   Editor).  As you can see in the attached movie the Action menu
   is shown
   when I double-click a CA-database and the menu is populated with
   "Edit
   application". During the rendering of the database UI the the
   entire
   Actions sub-menu seems to be populated correctly, but then when
   you
   click the entry again the only entry is "Edit application" (you
   can see
   it in the video). If the action menu is open when the UI
   finishes the
   rendering the sub-menu is not populated with the rest of the
   actions.
   I'll have to click on Actions menu entry one more time.
   
   Either the Actions menu should not be shown until the UI is
   finished or
   (which I would prefer) the Actions menu should be populated
   dynamically
   and automatically as soon as the respective sub menu entries is
   read
   from the database.
