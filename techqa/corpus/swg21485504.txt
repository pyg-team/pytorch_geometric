Title: IBM How can I install SPSS Statistics-Python Integration Plug-in in both client and server? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 My installation of SPSS Statisitics Client and Server are installed on the same PC. I'd like to know how can I install SPSS Statistics-Python Integration Plug-in on both client AND server.

The problem is that the PlugIn installer only permits me to choose the client OR server installation folder, and running the installation a second time will only give me the options to Remove or Repair the plug-in.

Is there any way to install this plug-in for both Client and Server version of SPSS Statistics? 

ANSWER
Since SPSS Statistics Client and Server were never designed to run on the same computer, installing the plug-in twice is not possible. Since the installation files and registry settings are the same, Windows will always recognize this application and will not allow you to install in a different directory.

If you only have one machine and must install both SPSS Statistics Client and Server, IBM SPSS recommends the use of a virtualization environment such as VMware ESX. Please note that only SPSS Statistics Server is considered compatible and supported in a virtual environment
