APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description:
   
   On a Windows 64-bit machine with the Agent Compatibility Package
   installed, upgrade of anything on the ITM 6.2.2 FP1 base CD to
   ITM 6.2.2 FP2 base CD causes the 6.2.2 FP2 base upgrade to fail.
   The message issued states that the Agent Compatibility Package
   must be upgraded first, before the base CD can be upgraded. If
   OK is pressed this error continues until the install is
   cancelled.
   
   The upgrade of base components (TEMS, TEPS, TEP Desktop, WPA,
   S&P) do not require the Agent Compatibility Pack and should not
   ask for it during an upgrade.
   
   
   Environment:
   
   Windows 64-bit only where ITM 6.2.2 FP1 base components are
   installed with the 64-bit Windows OS Agent and the Agent
   Compatibility Pack.
   
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   
   Must be done on a Windows 64-bit machine.
   1. Install ITM 6.2.2 FP1 TEMS for example as an RTEMS.
   2. Install the Windows 64-bit OS Agent and the Compatibility
   Pack.
   3. Attempt to upgrade the TEMS from 6.2.2 FP1 to 6.2.2 FP2. The
   upgrade will loop with a message that the compatibility pack is
   at 6.2.2 FP1 and it is required to be at 6.2.2 FP2. The loop
   continues until the install is cancelled.  To function properly,
   the upgrade of TEMS should be accepted and processed without
   requesting the compatibility pack.
   
   
   Related files and output:
   
   During install, a pop-up will appear containing the following
   message:
   
   "The Agent Compatability Package in version 06220200 is required
   but unavailable."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the 6.2.2 FP2 agent media to upgrade the 64-bit Windows OS
   agent and Agent Compatibility Package first, then upgrade the
   base components.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Upgrade from IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 FP1 to IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring 6.2.2 FP2 any base component where IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring 6.2.2 FP1 64-bit Windows Agent is installed causes
   the install to loop until the customer cancels the install.  The
   message issued states the Agent compatibility package must be
   upgraded first, before the base CD can be upgraded. If OK is
   pressed this error continues to appear until the install is
   cancelled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to add extra messages that direct the
   customer to run the Agent CD upgrade first to IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring 6.2.2 FP2 so the compatibility pack can be upgraded,
   then to rerun this install.  The compatibility pack is required
   by the Agent framework, which will be upgraded by the base
   install, but the compatibility pack is only available on the
   Agent CD so the Agents must be upgraded first.  The Agent
   install will upgrade both the Agent framework and compatibility
   pack.
   
   The install now aborts after the error is explained and does not
   loop.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Cancel the install and run the Agent upgrade first.
