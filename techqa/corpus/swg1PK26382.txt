APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Message ADMA5026E is generated when mapping an application to
   an unmanaged webserver and system property:
   com.ibm.websphere.management.enableFileServiceMBean=true
   in the AppServer. This property enables the Node Agent to return
   the AppManagement MBeans as well as the Deployment Manager which
   causes the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set com.ibm.websphere.management.enableFileServiceMBean=false or
   contact Level 2 for a tempfix jar file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Application Server    *
   *                 V6.0.1 for z/OS                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Re-Map of MapModuletoServer on a        *
   *                      installed application in a ND set up    *
   *                      (NetWork Deployment) fails.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the System property
   com.ibm.websphere.management.enableConfigMBean  is set to true
   on one or more processes running in theNetWork Deployment set
   up,an action of MapModuletoServer on a installed application ,
   fails with an exception:
   Caused by:
   com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException:
   
   ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName
   
   WebSphere:cell=wdcell,node=WEB1,server=IMWEBSRV for module
   
   PurchaseOrder_Web.war+WEB-INF/web.xml.
   
     at
   
   com.ibm.ws.management.application.AppAssociation.
   getServerNames(AppAssociation.java:1308).
   
   This is due to the incorrect MBeans returned from the query
   due to this property being set.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code changes made to make sure that the correct MBean  is
   returned  on which the task can be invoked without failure.
   
   APAR PK26382 is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
   Level (Fix Pack) 6.0.2.15 of WebSphere Application Server V6.0.1
