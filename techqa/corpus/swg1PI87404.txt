APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  '/SIGN userid userpw NEWPW nuserpw VERIFY nuserpw'.
   If password verification option is not enabled in IMS the VERIFY
   keyword is ignored and the new user password is not verified,
   although the user is not notified that the new password was not
   verified. The nuserpw entry for NEWPW may differ from the entry
   for VERIFY nuserpw. This may result in invalid password on next
   attempt to sign on.

   ****************************************************************
   IMS was defined with the 'Password Verification' option
   disabled, which is the default setting in the IMS
   initialization user exit DFSINTX0.
   
   The VTAM terminal user issued a /SIGN command to signon
   to IMS.  The user attempted to change the password on
   the /SIGN command by specifying NEWPW and VERIFY keywords.
   However, IMS did not verify that the passwords specified
   for NEWPW and VERIFY matched - in fact, IMS ignored the
   VERIFY keyword.
   
   IMS documentation indicates that the VERIFY keyword can be
   used to validate the new password, but this was only being
   done when the 'Password Verification' option in DFSINTX0
   was enabled.
   
   The purpose of the 'Password Verification' option is to
   prompt the user to reenter a new password when VERIFY is
   not specified on the /SIGN command.
   
   However, if specified on the /SIGN command, the VERIFY
   keyword should be processed in any environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The VERIFY keyword of the /SIGN command will be processed
   in all environments.  If NEWPW and VERIFY are specified,
   then the passwords will be validated.
   
   DFSNCS40 is modified to process the VERIFY keyword value
   with or without 'Password Verification' enabled.
   
   The following documentation updates are required:

   /SIGN command:
   
   Add the following to the VERIFY keyword description:
   
   The VERIFY keyword can be used to verify new passwords
   whether or not the 'Password Verification' option is
   enabled in the Initialization exit routine DFSINTX0.
   
   When 'Password Verification' is enabled, the user must
   verify new passwords either by specifying both NEWPW
   and VERIFY on the /SIGN command, or by reentering the
   password on the DFS3656 panel.
   
   When 'Password Verification' is disabled, the user
   can verify new passwords by specifying both NEWPW
   and VERIFY on the /SIGN command.
