APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Windows WebSphere MQ 7.5.0.0 works with WebSphere MB 8.0.
   When the data flow engine of WebSphere MB crashes, the in-flight
   message is backed out to the input queue.
   Then, the data flow engine restarts automatically. However, the
   back-out message is not consumed by MQ. Instead, it consumes
   the next message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere MQ for Windows who terminate
   application processes forcefully
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   An application connects to MQ and starts a unit of work under
   which it puts or gets messages. That application is then
   forcefully terminated, for example killing the process through
   the task manager. MQ should notice the application has
   terminated and roll back the unit of work. Instead, it
   believes the application is still operational, and hence the
   inflight messages stay inflight until the queue manager is
   restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ has been modified to perform an extra check for a process
   it believes to be operational, which enables it to determine
   if the process has been forcefully terminated, and hence
   appropriate rollbacks now occur.
