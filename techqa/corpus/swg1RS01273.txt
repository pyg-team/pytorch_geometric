APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The method getXOMClassMappingForBOMType can be used in a
   scenario provider to get the class and clasloader information
   from the BOM and this can then be used to instantiate classes.
   When the XOM is managed by the RES this method does
   not return the class from the ruleset classloader and it is
   not possible to instantiate new instances from on it.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The class returned by this method is serialized so there is no
   reference to the original classloader when it is available in
   the SSP
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is modified so that the provider class is created in
   the XOM classloader which makes every objects defined in the
   ruleset also available in the data provider.
