QUESTION
How does Notes treat symbols (such as @ & : /) in a Full Text query?

ANSWER
Notes treats most symbols as white space. For example, there is no difference between the string "$800" and the string "800." Both will be found whether or not the query includes the $ (dollar) sign.
Exceptions:

A leading @ sign (located at the beginning of a word) is indexed. For example, to Notes, the word "@command" is different from the word "command." You can search for these two words independently. A nested @ sign is also indexed, to allow for the searching of Internet addresses.

Notes recognizes the following four symbols in a query if they are embedded within a word; however, Notes does not recognize them if they located are at the beginning or the end of a word:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The words "cc:mail" and "boot.bat," for example, are treated differently than "cc mail" and "boot bat." In addition, note that the ampersand (&) is a reserved character; to search for a string such as "AT&T," enclose the word in quotes (in the query). These four symbols are ignored by a query if they are located at the beginning or end of the word. You can search for any of these characters if they are contained within spaces. For example, you can search for "AT & T" or "Mr / Mrs". 

Hyphens are one of the characters that is treated as white space (even if embedded within a word). In addition, the forward slash ( /) cannot be used in a query. The forward slash is often used in text as a delimiter between words such as "our fly/drive plan" and "and/or."
