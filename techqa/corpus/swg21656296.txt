db2haicu -delete TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why db2haicu does not remove all the virtual IPs and resources? 

CAUSE
You can not delete a virtual IP or resource if you are not the instance owner.



ANSWER
Virtual IPs and resources, can only be deleted from the instance where they were created. 


When running db2haicu with the -delete parameter, db2haicu immediately deletes the resource groups associated with the current database manager instance, without confirming whether those resource groups are locked.
To remove resource groups associated with the database manager instances of a DB2 High Availability Disaster Recovery (HADR) primary/standby database, perform the following steps:


a) Run db2haicu with the -delete parameter against the database manager instance of the HADR standby database (it should be run first on the standby database).
b) Run db2haicu with the -delete parameter against the database manager instance of the HADR primary database.

To remove a virtual IP from an HADR resource group using db2haicu, you must remove it from the instance on which it was created.

In case you can not remove it with the db2haicu you can try to remove it via TSA using the command "rmrg":

"rmrg <resource_group_name>"
