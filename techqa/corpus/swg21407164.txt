Text:
TagManagedEntities.stch TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have Provider and End Customer devices in our subnets that we do not want to monitor. What is the best practice to unmanage these devices permanently? 

ANSWER
 To permanently unmanage devices is, tag them via TagManagedEntities.stch. Take a look at it in $NCHOME/precision/disco/stitchers directories. Below is the excerpt where you add a condition for some common field within devices you want to unmanage. As always make sure to backup original stitcher first.

// Modify this statement to unmanaged specific types of interface

oqlUpdate = oqlUpdate + interfaceFilter + rediscoveryFilter +

( 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'Dialer' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'Async' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'Virtual' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'Null' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'NULL' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'Vlan' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfDescr like 'VLAN' 
OR 
ExtraInfo->m_IfAlias like 'NoMon' 
//Lets say - Provider devices are of specific model e.g. OID being '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.278'- then you could add something like below:
OR
EntityOID like '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.278'
)
