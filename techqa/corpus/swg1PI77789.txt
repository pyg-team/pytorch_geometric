   ****************************************************************
   This enhancement provides support for the ALT Table and Create
   Table functions as follows:
   
   1- The new LONGNAMES / SHORTNAMES cursor-sensitive command on
   panels ADB27C 'ALTER Table' and ADB26CTF 'Create Table Columns'
   toggles between column name displays of 30 and 18 characters to
   allow viewing of the entire column name without having to scroll
   in LONGNAMES mode the Operation Type field is removed.
   
   2- On the column update panels ADB26CTU (ALT) and ADB26CUU
   (Create Table), the column name field is lengthened to the
   maximum of 30 characters. Also, a new primary command, NEXTCOL,
   is added to move to the next column in the table without
   exiting the panel. When updating the last column in the table,
   NEXTCOL will wrap to the first column. If filtering is
   active for the columns in the table, NEXTCOL moves to the
   next column in the filtered view.
   
   The following new messages have been added
   
   Number : ADBC305E
   Text :        A deleted column cannot be updated.
   Explanation : An attempt to update a deleted column was made,
                 either by issuing the "U" line command on a
                 column, or by making changes directly on the
                 panel.
   System Action : Processing stops.
   User Response : Remove the "U" line command if needed, and
                   retain the columns original specification.
   
   Number : ADBC306E
   Text :         A DB2-generated column cannot be updated.
   Explanation :  An attempt to update a DB2 implicitly-generated
                  column was made, either by issuing the "U" line
                  command on a column, or by making changes
                  directly on the panel.
   System Action : Processing stops.
   User Response : Remove the "U" line command if needed, and
                   retain the column's original specification.
