 This document contains system requirements for WebSphere MQ V6 on Linux for System z. 

CONTENT
The System Requirements documented on this page, for the Linux on zSeries s390x platform, are for the 64-bit zSeries operating systems.

Cryptography Cards [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006794&amp;aid=1] Refer to the Cryptography Card List for WebSphere MQ v6 and v7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&context=SSEP7X&q1=cryptography&uid=swg21326434&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] document for further information. 
Notes: 

 

 1.  JDBC/XA usage is not supported on this platform. 
 2.  Only the 31-bit version is supported. 
 3.  On platforms where WebSphere MQ provides a 64-bit product, both 32-bit and 64-bit MQ APIs are supported and the OS must be capable of running 64-bit applications. 
 4.  On 64-bit platforms where WebSphere MQ provides both a 32-bit and a 64-bit product, there is NO migration path from V6 32-bit Queue Managers to V6 64-bit Queue Managers. Customers are strongly advised to install WebSphere MQ 64-bit products on 64-bit platforms as there is a migration path from V5 32-bit products to V6 64-bit products. 
 5.  The 'MQ Explorer' is not supported on this platform. 
 6.  Only 64-bit DB2 instances can be used with 64-bit WebSphere MQ. 
 7.  WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.0 or later is required. 
 8.  Defect support is available for virtualisation environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ, regardless of whether Linux for zSeries is running natively in a LPAR or within a z/VM, or whether IFLs are used. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualisation environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualisation environment itself. 
 9.  On Linux platforms, if you need to use SSL in a C++ MQ application then you must link the application against the libstdc++.so.5 runtime library. This is because the version of the GSkit SSL libraries supplied with MQ depends on libstdc++.so.5 and this GSkit version is not compatible with other C++ runtime library versions. MQ C++ applications built against the GCC 3.2 or 3.3 C++ runtime libraries comply with this restriction and will be able to use SSL 
 10. The use of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in EJBs and MDBs is fully supported. The WebSphere MQ base classes for Java are supported with restrictions - for more details see, Using WebSphere MQ Java Interfaces in J2EE/JEE Environments [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&dc=DB520&uid=swg21266535&loc=en_US&cs=UTF-8&lang=en&rss=ct171websphere] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&dc=DB520&uid=swg21266535&loc=en_US&cs=UTF-8&lang=en&rss=ct171websphere]. 
 11. WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.5 or later is required. 
 12. SELinux must be disabled. 
 13. WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.6 or later is required. 
 14. WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 or later is required.
