Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you enable or disable outbound SSL and/or management CAs health check with tuning parameters on the IBM QRadar Network Security (XGS) appliance? 

ANSWER
The health checks for various components, including the Certificate Authority (CA) public key, are performed everyday on the XGS appliances. When a public key is expiring in 60 days, the health check will generate several events in System Events, while the agent health status is displayed as Unhealthy in SiteProtector.

The XGS appliance checks two CA sets, Management Certificate Authorities and Trusted Certificate Authorities (used by Outbound SSL Inspection):


 * To locate Management Certificate Authorities, from the Local Management Interface (LMI), click Manage System Settings > Network Settings > Management Certificate Authorities. 
 * To locate Trusted Certificate Authorities, from LMI, click Manage System Settings > Network Settings > Outbound SSL Inspection Settings.


To enable or disable the health check of either outbound SSL or management CA on the XGS appliance, 
 1. From the LMI, click Manage System Settings: Advance Tuning Parameters. 
 2. Set up the following values, as needed:
     * Outbound SSL CA:
       certs.check.expiry.cabundle=true or false
       
     * Management CA:
       certs.check.expiry.mca=true or false
    
    


Notes:  * true (default) for enabling the feature, while false for disabling. 
 * When a CA expires, the health status of the XGS appliance will not change.
