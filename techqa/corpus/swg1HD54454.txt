APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  NCG / TWO BLANK LINES ARE OUTPUTTED IN APT
   SOURCE
   .
   SCENARIO
   .
   1. Start CATIA
   2. File / Open CATProcess
   3. Click " Generate NC Output Interactively " (see
   ppt) Execute
   2 blank lines are outputted in APT source
   Remark: On CATIA V4 (CATNC utility), there is no
   blank line.
   On Postprocessor, if there is unnecessary character
   or blank in APT, operation cannot be done
   successfully.
   .
   PROBLEM
   .
   Two empty lines are generated at the end of APT
   file
   .
   EXPECTED RESULT
   .
   No blank lines should be generated in APT file
   .
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   CATIA
   .
   Incident Diagnosis :
   TWO BLANK LINES ARE OUTPUTTED IN APT
   SOURCE
   .
   Restriction Explanation :
   The amount of code change to implement this is
   huge and too dangerous to implement as it has an
   impact on the architecture. Also, this has an impact
   on the current APT structure which is used by other
   users.
   .
   By-Pass :
   remove the lines manually
   .
