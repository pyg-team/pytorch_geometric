ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to connect to the Domino server, IBM Content
   Collector might hang. An error similar to the following message
   is logged in the Email Connector log file:
   2014-04-16T16:36:53.355Z INFO     [291518] CRT Out of memory
   exception: :  ("bad allocation")
   [com.ibm.afu.mailconnector.collector.resolver.automatic.Automati
   cResolver resolve] [RMI TCP Connection(1)-10.130.39.95
   0]Exception
   [com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailOutOfMemoryException]: CRT Out
   of memory exception: :  ("bad allocation")

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When connecting to the Domino server, IBM Content Collector
   scans the Domino address book to resolve all mailboxes on the
   server. This is done in a paged approach, because the address
   book contains a large number of entries. If the last call to the
    address book returns only a single entry, Content Collector
   runs into an infinite loop, which in turn results in an out of
   memory exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 5 and 4.0.0
   Fix Pack 3, the problem of running into an infinite loop when
   accessing the Domino address book has been fixed.
