The following defect solutions are included in this release:

8.1.0-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0016
--------------------------

IJ00723
The JRE for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V8.1.0 is updated to IBM JRE
7.0 SR10 FP20.


IJ01428
When a probe is installed as a Windows Service and is stopped via
the Service Controller, the probe occasionally crashed.
Subsequently, application Error 1000 or 1001 was listed in the
Windows Event Log. This issue is now fixed.


IJ01536
TLSV1.2 is now enabled irrespective of FIPS mode. It was
previously only enabled if running in FIPS SP800-131 mode.


IJ02556
In the OMNIbus scope-based event grouping extension, there was an
edge condition whereby if you had multiple groups present with
the same ScopeID, then old childless parent events were not
cleared if there was another active parent event present with the
same ScopeID. This is now fixed. With this fix installed,
expired parent events that have no children, will clear and will
be deleted out of the system, as usual.


IJ02853
The GSKit version has been upgraded to GSKit v8.0.50.87 on
OMNIbus 7.4.0, and OMNIbus 8.1.0. The new GSKit version includes
a fix for a potential security problem.


IJ03072
A regression was introduced by the work done for APAR IV78263 in
OMNIbus 8.1.0.5. The regression caused an ObjectServer restart
failure if the internal limit of a 'create or replace
procedure...' statement exceeded 32K. This failure happened even
if the procedure loaded and executed successfully before. After
the ObjectServer restarted a parse error was logged in the
ObjectServer's logfile, similar to the following error:
Error: E-PRO-002-004: Failed to parse procedure <procedure_name>.
Parse failure on line nnnn

In order to fix this regression, the internal limit is now
increased to 40K and a check is now in place to reject any
procedure that exceeds the 40K limit and log an error to report
that rejection.


IJ03480
The fix for APAR IV90179 causes a regression in the ObjectServer
gateways which leads to periodic crashes. Therefore the fix for
APAR IV90179 is now rolled back.


IJ04088
The checkpoint files for the ObjectServer were not flushed to
disk on Windows, which caused data loss if the Windows server or
ObjectServer process terminated unexpectedly. This problem is now
fixed.


IV79173
Depending on network setup, ProcessAgent could take a long time
to start up as it tries to resolve the hostnames of all aliases
for all interfaces on the local machine. To avoid this delay, a
new command line option "-nohostlookup" is now added, which
disables hostname resolution of interface aliases.


IV81481
On Solaris operating systems, nco_confpack displays an error
message stating library libFilePermsJNI.so is not in library
search path. The problem occurs when nco_confpack is connected
to an ObjectServer containing an external automation that
references an executable file not recorded in
$NCHOME/omnibus/etc/exclusions.xml. The problem is fixed in this
release.


IV82062
When you use log file pools, with either the NDE_LOGFILE_USEPOOL
environment variable or the -logfileusepool probe command line
option, then any existing log files are truncated. The behaviour
is now corrected. Now, new log entries are appended to any
existing files, to avoid loss of log files when a process
restarts.


IV89921
The TCR Reports supplied in the OMNIbus extensions directory did
not show a report end date. This issue is now fixed.

If your computer has internet access and you have an IBM Passport
Advantage account, you can update packages directly from Passport
Advantage.
1. Start Installation Manager.
2. Under the Preferences option, select Repositories and make
sure the "Search service repositories during installation
and updates" is checked.
3. Select the update option and select the "IBM Tivoli Netcool
OMNIbus" entry from the list of packages to find updates for.

Local Repository
----------------
Extract the Fixpack into a new temporary directory, then specify the
repository in the preferences before you update. Each package must
be extracted into a new directory.
1. Start Installation Manager.
2. Under the Preferences option, select Repositories and add a
new repository. Give the location of the extracted
OMNIbusRepository/composite directory
3. Select the update option and select the "IBM Tivoli Netcool
OMNIbus" entry from the list of packages to find updates for.

Electronic Software Delivery(ESD) Zip File
----------------------------------------------
If you have downloaded the ESD for Fix Pack 14 then:
1. Create a directory to store the files and extract the contents
on the zip file into this.
2. If you have installed Installation Manager using either
Administrator or Nonadministrator mode, run the update_gui
script to launch Installation Manager into the update panel
without the requirement of configuring the update repository.
3. If the script fails, or Installation Manager is installed in
Group mode, or you want to run in console mode, then you must
configure the update repository as in the Local Repository
above, with the new repository being the extracted
OMNIbusRepository/composite directory.
4. Select the "IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus" entry from the list of
packages to find updates for.
