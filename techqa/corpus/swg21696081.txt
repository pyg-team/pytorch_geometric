QUESTION
 During the installation of 1.1.1.-TIV-JazzSM-multi available from this link
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038326 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038326]

The installation instructions do not contain details on how to install without an external internet
connection. During the update of WebSphere application server 8.5 we cannot connect to www.ibm.com on port 433.

Our company firewall rules do not allow for external connections and we cannot open port 433. 

How can this be installed without internet access?


CAUSE
The installation process checks for updates which can be disabled.

ANSWER
The following work around should apply to all versions of JazzSM starting with version 1.1.0.1 and all OS platforms. 

(1) Start Installation Manager using command
/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/IBMIM

(2) Go to Menu "File -> Preferences -> Repositories"
Uncheck the option "Search service repositories during installation and
updates"

(3) Go to Menu "File -> Preferences -> Updates"
Uncheck the option "Search for Installation Manager updates"

(4) Restart Installation Manager and then try the JazzSM update
