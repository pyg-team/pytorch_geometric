QUESTION
 How do I set the viewer widget to use the default IBM 速WorkplaceXT document viewer instead of IBM 速Content Navigator? 

CAUSE
The Case Manager Client has been deployed with the Case Manager Client Viewer task set to use IBM Content Navigator. The widget needs to be reconfigured so that it stops using IBM Content Navigator and starts using the document viewer used by WorplaceXT.

ANSWER
Delete the com.ibm.acm.client.nexusBaseURL custom properties from the Mashups Endpoints resource environment provider.

 * 2. Select Resources >Resource environment providers > Mashups_Endpoints > Custom Properties 
 * 3. Search for the com.ibm.acm.client.nexusBaseURL custom property. This is the property that sets the Case Manager Client viewer widget to use Content Navigator. 
 * 4. Note the property name and value and then delete it. If necessary, replacing the property will set the client to use Content Navigator again. 
 * 5. Delete the com.ibm.acm.client.nexusBaseURL custom property. 
 * 6. Restart WebSphere.


The Case Manager client viewer widget will now use the viewer used in WorkplaceXT. NOTE: Just clearing the value for this property will not work. The property must be deleted. 

The com.ibm.acm.client.nexusBaseURL Custom Property that needs to be removed is shown in the screen shot below:

The WorkplaceXT URL Custom Property com.ibm.acm.client.workplaceXTBaseURL should already exist. Otherwise, create one. See the screen shot below.
