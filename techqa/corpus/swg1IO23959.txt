APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  'Add' button not getting enabled after clearing choice list
   lookup even if all mandatory fields are filled in.
   We are facing an issue while adding a document via entry
   templates(template made in ICN, modified with layout
   Editor).This happens when we clear the
   choicelist and try to enter the new value for the property
   again.
   
   Only happens where initial default value is set for a EDS
   dependent choice list, and the ET has been modified with Layout
   editor.
