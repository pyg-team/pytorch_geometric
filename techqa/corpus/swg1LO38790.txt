   Steps:
   1. In server configuration document -> Domino Web Access tab,
   click
   "View/Modify..." button to open the window of DWA Default
   Welcome Page Settings.
   2. Choose "Custom Layout" in the drop down list of "Page
   Layout"
   3. Select anyone of layout among layout 1 to layout 6.
   4. Select Mail type for the firs panel, and choose "All message"
   in Options,
   and make sure "High priority mail only" is unchecked. To choose
   this option
   should make all message in the inbox shown in the welcome
   page.
   5. To set any other types for other panels, and click OK to save
   and close this
   window.
   6. Save & Close server configuration document
   7. Run "tell http restart" command on server console.
   8. Log on DWA
   9. Switch to Welcome page if it is not the default page.
   
   Bug: You will find that not all mail messages in inbox are shown
   in the mail
   panel. Only those unread messages are shown, which is
   incorrect.
   
   Note that:
   It works well in DWA, when set "Last 10 unread message" instead
   of "All
   message" in Options in server configuration document.
