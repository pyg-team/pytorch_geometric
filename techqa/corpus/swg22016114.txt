VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2018-7489 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7489]
DESCRIPTION: FasterXML jackson-databind could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a deserialization flaw in the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. By sending specially crafted JSON input, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139549 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139549] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2018-5968 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5968]
DESCRIPTION: FasterXML jackson-databind could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by deserialization flaws. By using two different gadgets that bypass a blacklist, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138088 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138088] for the current score
