PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SecurityWatch events are seen in the EventList and the source is the ImpactServer host 

CAUSE
The connection details in the EIC_alertsdb DataSource or other default DataSources have become out dated and the connection attempts at Impact start-up are captured by the ObjectServer SecurityWatch utility.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the connection details of the EIC_alertsdb DataSource or other default DataSources in the Impact configuration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the EIC_alertsdb DataSource or other default DataSources connection details in Impact to prevent unwanted ObjectServer SecurityWatch messages from Impact.
