Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in IBM Business Monitor. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566
DESCRIPTION: IBM Business Monitor could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This problem affects the following versions of the product: 

 * WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0.0.x 
 * WebSphere Business Monitor on zOS Version 7.0.0.x 
 * WebSphere Business Monitor Hypervisor Edition Version 7.0.0.x

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM Business Monitor and WebSphere Business Monitor completely rely on WebSphere Application Server to provide HTTPS capabilities. We recommend that customers install an interim fix for the IBM JDK to disable SSLv3. For information on the required fix refer to the the Remediation/Fixes section in the following bulletin: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173] Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

Note that other related products are affected by this vulnerability. In the context of applying fixes for
WebSphere Business Monitor or IBM Business Monitor, you will also want to update Installation Manager to version 1.8.

To fully mitigate the POODLE vulnerability for server side components, an additional fix for the bundled Business Space is required (JR51686) below:

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Customers who cannot or do not want to install the fix recommended in the "Remediation/Fixes" section of this security bulletin can disable the use of SSLv3 using manual configuration as described in "Workarounds and Mitigations" under the "Client configuration files" section in the following bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]
