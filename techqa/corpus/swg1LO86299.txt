LOCAL FIX
 *  None
   
   Note: Replacing the com.ibm.xsp.dojo directory located in
   <Notes program directory>\osgi\shared\eclipse\plugins with the
   version in <Notes
   program>\directory>\framework\shared\eclipse\plugins does allow
   the CKEditor to load without error but Xpages development
   indicated this is not supported
