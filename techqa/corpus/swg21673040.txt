 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 is affected by a problem that is related to the SSL implementation. This problem can cause, under a very specific condition, the CPU utilization to increase rapidly or allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963] https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]
Description: 
IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 is affected by a problem that relates to the handling of specific SSL messages. The TLS implementation can cause the CPU utilization to increase rapidly under the following condition: An error occurs that causes a single thread to loop. If this error occurs several times, more threads will start to loop. The CPU utilization can increase to such an extent that the CPU is exhausted and IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 and other programs that run on the affected system, stop to respond.

This issue can affect the availability of the system but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely where an authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex. 

To determine if your systems are affected by this problem, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications V3.0 instances.

Description: 
An attacker running a program on the same machine as where the victim is running a program could use CPU timing information to discover key information about certain kinds of binary type Elliptic Curves used in Digital signatures during signing operations. Although GSKit only generates Prime type Elliptic Curves, externally generated keys may be imported in GSKit.
