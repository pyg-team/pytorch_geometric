PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running one of the IBM Industry Models offering installations, having checked the IDA Tools or the RSA Tools option, the installation process suddenly hangs and has to be closed. 

CAUSE
This can happen when one of the IBM prerequisite software applications, such as IBM InfoSphere Data Architect or IBM Rational Software Architect, is running.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As the Industry Models installation process uses the IBM Installation Manager silently when installing the IDA Tools or RSA Tools, it is necessary that any software packages that share the same package group into which these tools are going to be installed are closed.
