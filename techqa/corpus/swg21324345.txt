QUESTION
 How to force a user to re-login after 'n' minutes of inactivity in Change? 

ANSWER
By default Change is configured never to invalidate a user's session after inactivity for a period of time. This setting is present in the pt.cfg file located in <Change_home>\cs_app\webapps\synergy\WEB-INF\wsconfig: 

 * 
 * 
 * # forcing them to re-login. A value of '0' disables the timeout. 
 * [CCM_SYSTEM][USER_SESSION_TIMEOUT]0[/USER_SESSION_TIMEOUT][/CCM_SYSTEM] 
 * 


By default the setting is '0' so as never to invalidate the user. To set a time limit of inactivity, simply specify the time in minutes in the above line.  

Once set, save the file and then click 'Load configuration data' from 'Administration -> General' for the changes to take effect.
