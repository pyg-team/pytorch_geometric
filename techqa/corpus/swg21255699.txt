PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WebSphere Adapter for FTP version provides several ways to use FTP scripting, but the user guide does not provide enough information about using these features. This technote provides details not included in the user guide. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The WebSphere Adapter for FTP version provides options for running an FTP script file on the FTP server while the adapter is functioning. Note the following about the FTP script file: 

 * It must include only valid FTP commands. All invalid commands will be ignored. 
 * It must not include connection-related commands like connect, open, username, and password (because the FTP script is run after a connection has been established with the specified FTP server). 
 * It will be run at the userâ€™s home directory on the specified FTP server.


In outbound mode, the ExecuteFTPScript operation is provided by the adapter for running FTP script files. 

In inbound mode, the activation specification properties FTP Script File Executed Before Inbound and FTP Script File Executed After Inbound are provided, through which the adapter runs the specified FTP scripts both before and after every inbound poll cycle.
