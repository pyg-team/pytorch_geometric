TIPL2INST; location name IA log files TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Where I can find Install Anywhere (IA) logs for various products created by Deployment Engine? 

ANSWER
Deployment Engine creates IA and other logs during the installation and upgrades.
The IA log is the main log which should looked into first. The location of IA log file vary by each products. The following table shows the location of log files for each product. 

Note: This table may not be up to date and if the product you are installing is missing in the table then please check with the product support for location of log files.

Take a look into below technote to find the location of other log files created by DE and files related to Deployment engine:

For investigation of installation issues use IA log along with DE logs and the logs files under _uninst directory. The _uninst directory contains subdirectories for the base product installation and fix packs. Follow the subdirectories under _uninst directory for each fix pack and look for MachinePlan_localhost.log.
