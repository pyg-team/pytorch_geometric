Title: IBM Optim Connection Manager Receives an ORA-12505 Error when Connecting to an Oracle 12c Pluggable Database (PDB) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Optim Connection Manager shows the below error when connecting to an Oracle 12c PDB:
ORA-12505, TNS:listener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor 

CAUSE
To connect a client to an Oracle Pluggable Database, a service name must be specified. The Optim Connection Manager uses a Service IDentifier (SID). 

ENVIRONMENT
Support for Oracle Pluggable Database in Oracle 12c was added to Optim 11.3.0.6 (11.3.0 Fix Pack 6).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Starting with Oracle 12c, if a database is a Pluggable Database (PDB), the SID provided in the Optim Connection Name might not work. The reason is that for PDB, Oracle expects a service name. Optim Connection Manager expects a SID to be specified. To enable the SID to be interpreted by Oracle as a service name, add USE_SID_AS_SERVICE_<listener_name>=on in listener.ora and reload the listener. 

For example: 
$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora
USE_SID_AS_SERVICE_LISTENER=on
