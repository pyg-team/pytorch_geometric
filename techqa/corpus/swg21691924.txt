VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3505 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3505]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when handling DTLS packets. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95163 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95163] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3506 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3506]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing DTLS handshake messages. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume an overly large amount of memory.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95160 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95160] for more information
