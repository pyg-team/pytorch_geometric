PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the Option for Application Optimization (AO) license is applied to firmware version 4.0.2 on an XG45 appliance, the device features incorrectly show the AO Feature as enabled and available. 

SYMPTOM
If you purchased an AO (AptOpt) license for your XG45 appliance at a firmware level of 5.0.0 or later, and you apply that license to a 4.0.2 version of firmware, the AO feature incorrectly shows as enabled and available for the 4.0.2 version of firmware. 

AppOpt is the AO Feature tag name when you run the "show license" command. Here is an example: 


xi50# show license




Feature Enabled Available ------- ------- ------- MQ Yes Yes TAM Yes No DataGlue Yes Yes JAXP-API Yes Yes PKCS7-SMIME Yes Yes SQL-ODBC Yes No Tibco-EMS Yes No WebSphere-JMS Yes Yes XG4 Yes Yes Compact-Flash Yes Yes iSCSI Yes Yes LocateLED Yes Yes AppOpt Yes Yes Tibco-RV Yes No IPME Yes Yes 
CAUSE
The AO feature is only valid and supported on the XG45 appliance with firmware version 5.0.0 and later. The following steps show one way to reproduce the issue: 

 

 1. Upgrade an XG45 appliance to 5.0.0 
 2. Purchase the AO license 
 3. Install the AO license on the XG45 appliance 
 4. Downgrade the appliance to 4.0.2


Result: The AO license will appear to be active on the 4.0.2 firmware. However, using the AO capabilities on the XG45 appliance with 4.0.2 firmware yields inconsistent results as the AO feature is not fully functional. 

It is mandatory that you install and exercise the AO license feature on the XG45 appliance only with firmware version of 5.0.0 or later. 
ENVIRONMENT
This is a concern for customers with XG45 appliances that are running a 4.0.2 version of firmware, and who are planning to add the AO feature while moving to the 5.0.0 release. It is also a concern for customers who have XG45 appliances with firmware version 5.0.0 with the AO feature who are downgrading to the firmware version 4.0.2.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you are running firmware version 4.0.2, view the Device Features status provider. If the AppOpt support is listed as Enabled and Available, then you have this problem. 

To display the Device Features, click Status > System > Device Features in the left navigation panel in the graphical user interface.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Option for Application Optimization should only be installed on an XG45 appliance with firmware version of 5.0.0 or higher. If the license for AO is incorrectly installed on an XG45 appliance with a firmware version of 4.0.2, or an XG45 appliance with 5.0.0 with AO is downgraded to a 4.0.2 version, the AO feature will incorrectly appear as enabled and available. 


The AO features should not be used and are not supported on the XG45 appliance with firmware version 4.0.2.
