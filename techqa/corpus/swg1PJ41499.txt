PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers using Content Engine MP_4.5.1 and creating         *
   * documents with multiple content elements and using multiple  *
   * storage areas with a rolling storage policy.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Creating a document with multiple content elements would     *
   * fail to activate a new storage area in a rolling storage     *
   * policy.                                                      *
   * The first content element to be uploaded would correctly     *
   * select a storage area and mark it for transition to OPEN.    *
   * The next content uploaded would find the selected storage    *
   * area, but find it not open, as the transition was not yet    *
   * committed.                                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Content Engine 4.5.1.8-P8CE-FP008.                *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Content Engine 4.5.1.8-P8CE-FP008 and later include a code fix
   that will resolve this problem.
