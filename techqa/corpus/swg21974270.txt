Text:
CVE-2016-0201 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A vulnerability has been addressed in the GSKit component of IBM Rational ClearCase. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0201 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0201]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an MD5 collision. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
CCRC WAN Server: 
Rational ClearCase versions from 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.18, 8.0 through 8.0.0.17, and 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10, all platforms.

CMI and OSLC integrations:

Rational ClearCase versions from 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.18, 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.17, and 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10, Windows only.

The IBM GSKit is used if ClearCase on Windows platforms is configured to integrate with IBM Rational ClearQuest, Rational Team Concert, or Jira with communication over SSL (https). This applies to any integration using Change Management Interface (CMI), and to non-CMI based UCM-enabled CQ integration via OSLC. If your ClearCase deployment is not using these integrations, or not using SSL with the integrations, then your deployment is not sensitive to this attack.

The UCM-enabled CQ integration without using OSLC (SQUID) is not sensitive to this attack.

CMI and OSLC integrations



ClearCase Windows Client or WAN server Version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations, or CCRC WAN server 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.17 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations, or CCRC WAN server 8.0 through 8.0.0.3 Affected only if you use CCRC WAN server 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.18 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations, or CCRC WAN server 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.8 Not affected 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x Not affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
CCRC WAN Server:
Apply an IHS fix for the issue: 

 1. Determine the IHS version used by your CCRC WAN server. Navigate to the IBM HTTP Server installation directory (typically /opt/ibm/HTTPServer or C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\HTTPServer), then execute the script: bin/versionInfo.sh (UNIX) or bin\versionInfo.bat (Windows). The output includes a section "IBM HTTP Server for WebSphere Application Server". Make note of the version listed in this section. 
 2. Review the following IHS security bulletin for the available fixes: Security Bulletin:Vulnerabilities in the GSKit component of IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2016-0201 and CVE-2015-7420) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21974507]. Note: there may be newer security fixes for IBM HTTP Server. Follow the link below (in the section "Get Notified about Future Security Bulletins") to subscribe to WebSphere product support alerts for additional security fixes. 
 3. Apply the relevant fixes to your IBM HTTP Server installation used on your CCRC WAN server host. No ClearCase-specific steps are necessary.


CMI and OSLC integrations: 
The solution is to install a newer, fixed version of the GSKit runtime component. 

Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 11 (8.0.1.11) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042128] 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.17 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 18 (8.0.0.18) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042126] 7.1.2.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.1.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.0.x (all fix packs) Customers on extended support contracts should contact Customer Support. For affected 7.1.x and 7.0.x releases, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version of the product.
