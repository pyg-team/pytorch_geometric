 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is Job Code Default Data and how do I import JCDD through Workbench? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Job Code Default Data (JCDD) functionality allows your organization to associate a set of req field default values to a Job Code. This is especially useful to organizations that want to ensure that the proper values are auto-populated in fields when users select a Job Code to start the requisition creation process.
There are three ways you can update/maintain Job Code Default Data (JCDD) in Brassring.
1. Manual updates through BrassRing. Admin > Admin+ > Codes > Administer the code list for the Job Codes > Select to edit the job code youâ€™d like to update the default data for > Click through the pages and update the req fields as necessary > Save.
2. JCDD Import Integration (Position Data Import). JCDD can be kept up to date through an integration with your HRIS or system of record. A technical specification guide can be found here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045229&spng=10]. 
3. JCDD excel import via Workbench. This option is available for Workbench users with Power User access or for users that have Tier 5 access with the proper client setting enabled. The steps to successfully update JCDD via a Workbench import are covered in the linked sections below.
