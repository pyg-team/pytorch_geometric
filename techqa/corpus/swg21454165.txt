Title: IBM Dynamic XOM XSD changes not published to Rule Team Server/Decision Center - United States

XSD synch XOM BOM synchro TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When modifying XOM XML schema files, the changes are not published to Rule Team Server/Decision Center. 

SYMPTOM
RuleApps generated from Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center show the old XML schema files (XSDs), that is, those prior to the modification. 

This causes errors such as the following when executing rules on this dynamic eXecution Object Model (XOM):

ilog.rules.bres.xu.ruleset.IlrRulesetParseException: Cannot parse ruleset: Problem occurred during translation loading : test.MyClass.myAttribute : Cannot find attribute "myAttribute" in execution class "test.MyClass", error code: XU.ERROR.10014

where element 'myAttribute' was added to the test.MyClass in the XSD.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
XSDs are published to RTS along with the project properties. Consequently, whenever the XSDs are modified in Rule Studio you should see an entry "<project name> Properties (X.Y)" for the project properties in the Synchronization panel.

You may have omitted to push the project properties to RTS, and only published the Business Object Model (BOM). 

After you publish the project properties, you should see that the XSDs are up-to-date in the RuleApps generated from RTS.


Note: prior to V6.7.4, a limitation prevented the above from publishing the updated XSDs. The workaround was to restart Rule Studio after the BOM update and before the synchronization.
