APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "Corrupted Shared Memory files in the Queue Managers 'shmem'
   directory
   should not cause LEC to abend, and prevent Queue Manager from
   starting."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  na
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   WMQ OSS shared memory files contained invalid
   data due to cpu failure that caused OSS file system error. This
   corrupted the WMQ shared memory files that can be found in
   <MQInstall>/var/mqm/qmgrs/<qmgrname>/shmem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WMQ shared memory management code was revised to tolerate OSS
   shmem/shm files that contain invalid data. Invalid data in
   these files will be ignored and memory segment creation will
   continue normally.
   Released in WMQ HP NonStop Server V5315 fix pack
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually delete the files to recover the queue manager.
