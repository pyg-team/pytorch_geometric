QUESTION
 Commonly used APM / IBM Monitoring V8.1.2 part numbers. 

ANSWER
Here are the commonly used part numbers to search for when downloading the new IBM Monitoring / APM V8.1.2 components. The Agents package here will contain the WebSphere and other J2EE agents to be used for monitoring the WAS / J2EE servers. 
Note these are the upgrade part numbers, so you will need to use the base code parts [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961194] first. You can choose to download the eAssembly or the individual packages that you need.

These images are en_US, and multilingual, multiplatform where applicable. If you are looking for non-US English images, please do your search on Passport Advantage for the right image to download for your specific language, if available.

Not sure which package to download? Check this table [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLNR_8.1.1/com.ibm.pm.doc/install/saas_agent_capabilities.htm] to see what agent you want to monitor and then download the right package.
