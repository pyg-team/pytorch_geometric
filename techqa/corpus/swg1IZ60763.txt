PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem(Abstract)
   Import an asymmetric keypair of known size into TKLM. Using the
   tklmKeyList CLI with the verbose option, list the imported key.
   The keysize is listed incorrectly.
   
   Symptom
   For example, here is the listing of a 1024 bit key imported into
   TKLM. Notice it shows the keysize to be 2048.

   key type RSAPrivateKey
   owner null
   certifications null

   Resolving the problem
   Imported key sizes are not calculated correctly in the TKLM B2
   and displayed incorrectly when using the tklmKeyList CLI. This
   does not cause any functional problems in TKLM. This defect will
   be fixed in future release of the product.
