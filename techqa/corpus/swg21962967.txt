QUESTION
 Any considerations on setting TDWC session timeout to infinite? 

CAUSE
It is possible to set TDWC session timeout to practically infinite by following settings.
1.<TWA_home>/eWAS/profiles/tdwc_profile/config/cells/tdwc_cell/nodes/tdwc_node/servers/tdwc_server/server.xml
Parameter and value: invalidationTimeout="-1"

2.<TWA_home>/eWAS/profiles/tdwc_profile/config/cells/tdwc_cell/applications/isclite.ear/deployments/isclite/deployment.xml
Parameter and value: invalidationTimeout="-1"

3.<TWA_home>/eWAS/profiles/tdwc_profile/config/cells/tdwc_cell/security.xml
Parameter and value: timeout=""2147483647"



ANSWER
If you set session timeout to infinite, Http sessions do not timeout and memory used during these sessions will never be released until the actual log out is performed from TDWC. 


This could lead to high memory consumption and eventually OOM of java heap.

It is recommended to have finite session timeout values, so that unused memory will be released after session timeout time.

Be careful that closing the browser using "x", without logging out from TDWC, will cause memory to remain until WebSphere is stopped.
