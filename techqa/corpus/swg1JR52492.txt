APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   three-cluster topology that has non-default service component
   architecture (SCA) bus names (SCA.SYSTEM.<cellName>.Bus and
   SCA.APPLICATION.<cellName>.Bus), the following error is logged
   by the SCA on application cluster members when no messaging
   cluster member is configured on the same managed node
   (profile):
   
   CWSIT0086E: Bus BPM.<deName>.Bus not found
   
   The SCA cannot connect to the service integration bus (SIB)
   messaging engine (ME).

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   SIBs are synchronized only to managed nodes (profiles) when
   there is a server configured that uses SIB services.
   Therefore, when no bus is visible on the application cluster
   node, IBM BPM reverts to the default bus name, which does not
   exist.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.0 that ensures the SIB
   configuration is synchronized to managed nodes that have
   application cluster members even if no messaging cluster
   members are configured on those managed nodes.
