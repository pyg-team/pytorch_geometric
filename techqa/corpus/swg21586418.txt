Title: IBM PUT Wire mapping output should always use BLOB domain - United States

Text:
XMLNSC; BLOB; PUT wire; Message Broker; WTX; Transformation Extender TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using WebSphere® Transformation Extender (WTX) for Integration Servers with WebSphere® Message Broker (WMB), the WTX PUT Wire output would inadvertently use the domain of the first wired output card. This was causing memory leaks in WMB and was incorrect. 

SYMPTOM
After upgrade of WTX to 8.3.0.4 or 8.4 from 8.3.0.3 or earlier, the PUT Wire output domain changes from XMLNSC to BLOB. 


CAUSE
When using WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) for Integration Servers with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB), the PUT Wire mapping output should always use the BLOB domain. Previous to APAR PM27008, the WTX PUT Wire output would inadvertently use the domain of the first wired output card. This was causing memory leaks in WMB and was incorrect. The intended design was to have PUT wires always use the BLOB domain as there is no way to configure it.

ENVIRONMENT
WTX Mapping in Message Broker

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Add a WMB trace node to the PUT Wire output. Notice that the domain is now BLOB. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Put a ResetContentDescriptor node to change the domain from BLOB to XMLNSC or change output in the WTX map to a wired XML XMLNSC output card.
