PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker using  *
   *                 the SOAPInput nodes.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Starting the HTTP connector may fail    *
   *                      if it has only recently been stopped.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Starting the HTTP connector may fail if it has only recently
   been stopped because the connector port may not have been
   released.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to include a
   shutdownDelay property.
   This configurable property allows the user to specify a wait
   time between the last Message Flow relinquishing the HTTP
   connector and the HTTP connector being stopped.
   As a result if a Message Flow is stopped and immediately
   restarted, with the shutdownDelay property set, the HTTP
   connector start up will not fail as a result of the connector
   port still being in use.
   
   To configure the shutdownDelay property use
   mqsichangeproperties
   
   Syntax:
   >>-mqsichangeproperties--BrokerName--------------------->
   
   >-- -e --ExecutionGroupLabel---- -o --ObjectName-------->
   
   >-- -n --shutdownDelay---- -v --PropertyValue----------><
   
   Parameters
   BrokerName
    The name of the broker to modify.
   
   -e ExecutionGroupLabel
    The label of the execution group for which you want to
    change properties.
   
   -o ObjectName
    Either HTTPConnector or HTTPSConnector.
   
   -n shutdownDelay
   
   -v PropertyValue
    The time in seconds to delay the HTTP listener shutdown by.
   
   
   To report the shutdownDelay property use
   mqsireportproperties
   
   Syntax:
   >>-mqsireportproperties--BrokerName--------------------->
   
   >-- -e --ExecutionGroupLabel---- -o --ObjectName-------->
   
   >-- -n --shutdownDelay---------------------------------><
   
   Parameters
   BrokerName
    The name of the broker.
   
   -e ExecutionGroupLabel
    The label of the execution group for which a report is
    required.
   
   -o ObjectName
    Either HTTPConnector or HTTPSConnector.
   
   -n shutdownDelay
