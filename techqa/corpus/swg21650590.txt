PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempt to install IBM Netcool/OMNIbus WebGUI 7.3.1 FixPack 4 (FP4) on Windows 2008 fails with Deployment Plan error 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Netcool/OMNIbus WebGUI 7.3.1 with IBM Deployment Engine (DE), non-admin installation

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Installation log shows the following error:

2012-10-08 16:58:10.629 : 
$NCHOME\omnibus_webgui\_uninst\OMNIbusWebGUIFP4\plan\install\Mach
inePlan_localhost\MachinePlan_localhost.xml:269: The following error 
occurred while executing this line: 
$NCHOME\omnibus_webgui\_uninst\OMNIbusWebGUIFP4\plan\install\Mach
inePlan_localhost\MachinePlan_localhost.xml:352: Error executing step: 
An error was encountered running step WASFP 

Also, the DE was not properly updated during the install 

Omnibus 7.3.1 installer is bundled with DE 1.4.0.12. 

There is a known issue with DE 1.4.0.12 where it gets installed at C:\Users\<Username>\acsi_<username> on Windows 2008 machine instead of installing at default location C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\Common\acsi and this issue has been fixed in DE 1.4.0.15 onwards. 

From DE 1.4.0.15 onwards, DE gets installed at it's default location. 

Since DE bundled with Omnibus 7.3.1 FP3 installer is 1.4.0.16 and it checks whether DE exists at: C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\Common\acsi. Since it doesn't exists, it will install (new copy of) DE at: C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\Common\acsi location.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. Take DE backup using de_backupdb.cmd as command below : 

C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\acsi_<username>\bin\de_backupdb.cmd -bfile C:\Omnibus_DE_Backup 

2. Delete C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Common\acsi directory if it exists 

3. Run Omnibus 7.3.1 FP3 installer and cancel it after completion of DE install step. Now, we should have DE installed at C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\Common\acsi.

4. Restore DE backup file using below command : 

C:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\de_restoredb.cmd -bfile C:\Omnibus_DE_Backup 

5. Now, re-try Omnibus FP4 installation again and complete it
