APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Configuring an execution group to use SSL section in the
   Infocenter page ap12234_.htm has the following command for
   setting the port on which the execution group listens for HTTPS
   requests.
   mqsichangeproperties broker name
   -b httplistener -o HTTPSConnector
   -n port -v Port to listen on for https
   
   But the correct command to set the port on which the execution
   group listens for HTTPS requests is:
   mqsichangeproperties broker_name
   -e execution_group_name -o HTTPSConnector
   -n explicitlySetPortNumber -v Port to listen on for https
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker using HTTP/SOAP
   Nodes with SSL.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The command documented in ap12234_.htm for setting the port on
   which the execution group listens for HTTPS requests is
   incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Configuring an execution group to use SSL section in the
   Infocenter page ap12234_.htm has been updated as follows:
   
   mqsichangeproperties broker name
   -b httplistener -o HTTPSConnector
   -n port -v Port to listen on for https
   
   changed to :
   
   mqsichangeproperties broker_name
   -e execution_group_name -o HTTPSConnector
   -n explicitlySetPortNumber -v Port to listen on for https
   
   Infocenter page ap34020_.htm has been updated with following
   information :
   The HTTP nodes with broker-wide listener support PKI
   configuration only at broker level; the HTTP nodes with
   execution group listener and SOAP nodes support both levels.
