Title: IBM WAS 8.5.5 JDK and Sterling OMS 9.4 JDK are different versions - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WAS 8.5.5 may come with Java 1.6 enabled by default, depending on WAS version deployed. Sterling Order Management 9.4 is compiled against java 1.7. So when deploying the EAR a 'bad major version' or 'java major minor version mismatch' error may be thrown. 

SYMPTOM
At time of deployment a java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError error can be seen in installation logs.


CAUSE
Features of java 7 against which Sterling Order Management 9.4 is compiled against, may not be available on java 6.

ENVIRONMENT
Sterling Order management 9.4 deployment.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Deployment fails with java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a command in Websphere 8.5.x that allows selection of SDK, see links below. Use this to force WAS to use java 7




List available sdk's with:
./IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/managesdk.sh
-listAvailable

Change WAS SDK with, for example:
./IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/managesdk.sh -enableProfile -profileName
AppSrv01 -sdkname 1.7_64 -enableServers
