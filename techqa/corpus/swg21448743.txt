Title: IBM Memory Leak when solving my problem with parallel barrier - United States

Text:
OOM; MLK TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When solving iteratively my model with parallel barrier, I have noticed some huge memory leaks, leading to an OutOfMemory with CPLEX.



SYMPTOM
The memory leak occurs when using CPLEX 12.1, on a multithread environment, with the barrier algorithm.



CAUSE
This issue is due to a management bug in the Intel MKL library that CPLEX uses for barrier. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Setting the number of threads to 1, and the issue disappears.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This bug has been fixed in newest version of the MKL libraries, and the most recent patch release of CPLEX is using this corrected version. Accordingly, upgrading to CPLEX 12.1.2 or later will solve the issue.
An alternative workaround if you cannot upgrade the CPLEX version right away, is either to set the environment variable MKL_DISABLE_FAST_MM to 1 before you start CPLEX or load the CPLEX DLL, or to restrict CPLEX to 1 thread.
