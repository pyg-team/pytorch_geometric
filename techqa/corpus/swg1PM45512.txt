ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Windows 2003 Server
   
   SA version: SA v11.4.0.3
   
   Severity: Medium
   
   Description: When trying to generate an HTML report  for an
   encyclopedia(Eg : ST_GlobalCredit_WIP)  using IBM Rational
   System Architect  is very slow (i.e even after 4 days also the
   report generation does not complete)
   
   
   Expected Result: HTML Report generation using System Architect
   should take 4 days and odd  to generate report for an
   encyclopedia.
   
   Actual Result: Currently, HTML report generation using System
   Architect does not complete the generation  of report for an
   encyclopedia (Eg : ST_GlobalCredit_WIP) even after 4 days.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Restore the attached encyclopedia  (Eg : ST_GlobalCredit_WIP
   ).
   2. Make sure that the restored encyclopedia is an ?Enterprise?
   type
   3. Open the encyclopedia (Eg : ST_GlobalCredit_WIP) in System
   Architect.
   4. Navigate to Reports-?HTML reports.
   5. Under 'General Tab' available on the HTML report window make
   sure 'Publish home page'  path is been set to a convenient
   location and also make sure that 'Options' on the same page is
   set to  'Encyclopedia report'
   6.  Under  'Diagram tab' available on the HTML report window
   make  sure that  'Type' is set to 'any'  and  'Maximum diagram
   width' is set to 2975
   7.  Under  'List management tab' available on the HTML report
   window make sure 'Publish all diagrams' option is been check
   marked.
   8.  Under  'Preferences tab' available on the HTML report window
   make sure that 'Diagrams' and 'Definitions' are been check
   marked. Also 'Exclude GUID information' , 'Include all
   encyclopedia definitions' , 'Include parent/child links'  and
   'Save settings on exit ' available on the same page are been
   check marked.
   
   The only change here is that SAHtml.ini file location would be
   set to the location were it is available on our machine.
   
   Attachment :
   
   We have attached the  encyclopedia  shared by the user as well
   as the word document shared by the user.
   
   Support Observation :
   
   1. Tested the scenario at the support end on thick client of  SA
   (i.e  v11.3.1.1.624 ) installed on Windows 2003 and found that
   the HTML report generation did not complete even after  5 days.
   2. Tested the scenario at the support end on thick client of  SA
   (i.e  v11.4.0.3 ) installed on Windows 2008 and found that the
   HTML report generation did not complete even after  4 days.
   Please Note : The second test was done because the client had
   upgraded System Architect in their environment to the latest
   release.Also user is facing issues while generating HTML reports
   on System Architect thick client.

   ****************************************************************
   HTML report generation using System Architect does not
   complete the generation of report for an encyclopedia.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The HTML generation facility is very old, and can probably
   not cope with this amount of data. There are no plans to
   update this reporting method. The alternative is to use
   reports and a template in SA Publisher which will publish
   all diagrams, symbols, definitions, and all their
   properties. This method takes hours instead of days to
   complete. We plan to provide these Publisher files in a
   future install.
