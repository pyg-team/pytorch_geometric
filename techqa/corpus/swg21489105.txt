Title: IBM Cannot install Statistics from a network location. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to install SPSS Statistics from a network location. If I choose to install "All language Help files," I receive the following error: Error 1311. Source file not found: \\ServerName\SPSSInstalllocation\Help_ko.cab.

How can I install Statistics? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you want to make the CD-ROMs available from a shared network drive, create two directories on a shared network drive: disk1 and disk2. Copy the contents of the Disk 1 CD-ROM to disk1 and copy the contents of the Disk 2 CD-ROM to disk2. If these are Windows CDs, you then need to copy the contents of the SPSS Statistics subdirectory in disk2 to the SPSS Statistics subdirectory on disk1 

For Statistics 19 and above, please download the executable installation file from Passport Advantage to your desktop or DownloadDirector then find the file at the location and run it as Admin (recommended for Win7) 

This should allow your install to go through with out the error.
