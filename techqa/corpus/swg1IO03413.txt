APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If any leap days (Feb. 29) occur between the time the password
   was set and the start of the current year, then the password
   expiration date will be off by 1 day for every leap day in those
   prior years. A leap day in the current year will be correctly
   accounted for.
   
   For example, 2000, 2004 & 2008 are leap years:
   
       If the password was set anytime after Mar. 1, 2000, and
       expires anytime before Dec. 31, 2004, then there will be no
       error (2004 is the only leap year in the range, and is the
       same year the password expires).
   
       If the password was set anytime after Mar. 1, 2004, and
       expires anytime before Dec. 31, 2008, then there will be no
       error (same as above: 2008 is the only leap year in the
       range, and is the same year the password expires).
   
       If the password was set on Feb. 28, 2000 and was supposed to
       expire on Jan. 1, 2001, it will not expire until Jan 2, 2001
       (1 leap day occured between the start and end dates which
       was not in the same year as the end date).
   
       If the password was set on Feb. 28, 2000 and was supposed to
       expire on Jan. 1, 2009, it will not expire until Jan 4, 2009
       (3 leap days occured between the start and end dates which
       were not in the same year as the end date).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The code to calculate the number if seconds between the time the
   password was set and the current time did not correctly account
   for ALL intervening leap days, but on if there was a leap day in
   the current year.
