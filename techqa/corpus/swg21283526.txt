QUESTION
 What is the standard policy for producing interim and cumulative fixes for IBM WebSphere Portal, either version 6.0 or 6.1 and subsequent fix pack releases? 

ANSWER
For complete details on this and other information regarding service and maintenance updates refer to "Update Strategy for WebSphere Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21248245]" (#1248245 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21248245]). In the section entitled "Delivering updates," the following notes about interim fixes are provided. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21283526&amp;aid=1]
Cumulative Fix [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21283526&amp;aid=1]
 * A published cumulative fix, such as PM11273, contains fixes for multiple APARs in a single installable update 
 * WebSphere Portal produces cumulative fixes for several components, including the Portal Foundation (core), the Java Content Repository (JCR) and Web Content Management (WCM) components. Not all functional areas of the portal products provide cumulative fixes (CFs) 
 * A cumulative fix is built, tested and provided when enough individual fixes have accumulated, as determined by the component's Level Three support team 
 * A cumulative fix can be applied to a release, refresh pack, feature pack,or fix pack where applicable 
 * Cumulative fixes are validated and verified by IBM before publishing. Customers unable to wait for a fix planned for integration into a CF can request a temporary or interim fix during the course of a service call (PMR). 
 * It is recommended that you test functions affected by the WebSphere component fixed in your own environment prior to deploying on a production system unless an emergency need exists 
 * Refer to the Recommended fixes and updates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007603] page for currently available cumulative fixes. When urgent, the fix might also be highlighted on the Support page.

Interim Fix [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21283526&amp;aid=1]
 * A single published emergency fix, such as PK89999 
 * For functional areas or components not providing cumulative fixes, WebSphere Portal can only guarantee to provide fixes on the latest two fix pack levels of a release. A customer could be required to upgrade to the one of the two latest fixpacks before being able to install a fix. 
 * For functional areas or components already providing cumulative fixes, WebSphere Portal will only provide individual interim fixes upon request through a service call (PMR), and on the latest two fix pack levels of a release. A customer could be required to upgrade to the one of the two latest fix packs and possibly even a current CF before being able to install an interim fix. 
 * An interim fix or test fix that resolves one or more product defects. 
 * A fix can be applied to a release, refresh pack, feature pack, fix pack or cumulative fix level, where applicable 
 * Interim fixes are created when a stand-alone fix is required between fix packs or CFs. They are validated by at least one customer and verified by IBM before publishing. Test fixes are not generally released but might be provided by IBM support during the course of a service call (PMR). 
 * Only in very rare circumstances will individual interim fixes be published as generally available fixes 
 * It is recommended that you test functions affected by the WebSphere component fixed in your own environment prior to deploying on a production system unless an emergency need exists 
 * Refer to the Recommended fixes and updates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg27007603] page for currently available recommended or required fixes. When urgent, the fix will also be highlighted on the Support page.
