QUESTION
 How do you monitor the number of users who are logging on to IBM Rational DOORS? 

CAUSE
The administrative functions for DOORS does not provide a usage monitor capability

ANSWER
DOORS client usage can be monitored in the License server log or a DOORS database log.


 * License Server log [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21405073]
   DOORS clients connecting to the database are required to obtain a license when starting doors and return the license when closing doors. In environments using distributed Flexlm licensing 
   this activity is monitored and recorded in the server log.
   This logging does not impact DOORS database transactional performance.
   
   
 * DOORS Database Server log [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399206]
   By default database logging is not turned on since it can impact performance.
   You will need to to monitor client connections to a database server. 
   
   Warning: Enabling database logging puts additional overhead on transactions and will have an impact that could degrade the DOORS Database Server performance or the speed to complete a requested function. Therefore it is recommended to keep logging enabled only when necessary for limited diagnostic periods. Logging can be used for other database monitoring of client server transactions; therefore logging level values range from 1 to 6, with six being the most verbose logging. It is suggested to use the lowest level necessary since higher levels of logging put more overhead on transactions.
