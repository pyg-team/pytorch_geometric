Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on December 3, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM MQ Advanced Message Security (AMS) on IBM i. IBM MQ has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates through a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to fail.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
