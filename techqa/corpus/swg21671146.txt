PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The DASH widgets are not receiving data parameters from the widget publishers. Tivoli Directory Integrator TDI is used as a data provider and customer is not able to receive the publisherÂ´s parameters in the OpEntry, regardless of which widget being used. 

SYMPTOM
DASH Widgets are not receiving data from the TDI data source


CAUSE
One step got omitted during the preparation of the Tivoli Directory Integrator environment. 

ENVIRONMENT
Jazz SM with Tivoli Directory Integrator

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to get TDI to talk to the DASH server, you need to copy two .jar files from DASH to the TDI server. 


 
1. Copy the "com.ibm.di.api.bind.jar" and "com.ibm.di.api.rest.jar" files from the DASH server to the TDI server.

DASH source directory: <JazzSM Install Dir>/JazzSM/ui/installableApps 
TDI target directory: <TDI Install Dir>\TDI\V7.1.1\osgi\plugins 

2. Restart TDI (close the configuration editor and restart). 

3. Login to DASH and refresh the TDI connection. 


This is documented in Chapter 3 of the JazzSM Integration Guide.
