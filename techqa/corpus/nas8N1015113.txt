 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides information about how to configure a PuTTY session for tunneling Telnet traffic. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To configure a PuTTY session for tunneling Telnet traffic, do the following: 

1 Open PuTTY.EXE, configure your host name, and select SSH for port. 2 Type the name you wish to use for the saved connection. In this example it is my.test.server. Do not save this yet; we have to configure the ports for tunneling. 3 Click on the path to reach Tunnels (Connection > SSH >Tunnels):

The Destination is the connection on your remote SSH machine. localhost:23 will get you a Telnet connection. Select both Local ports accept connections from other hosts and Remote ports do the same.

A valid user-ID and password is required to start the ssh tunnel. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=5] 
8 Open IBM Personal Communications. Configure a new connection and use the parameters below:

Once the ssh tunnel is established, the Telnet traffic can be routed through the tunnel. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=6] 9 Click on Communications, and connect. You should get the remote sign on screen of the system you are tunneling to. 
A Signon screen to the OS/400 is presented after the Telnet request is routed through the ssh tunnel. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015113&aid=7] 

You can tunnel multiple ports if you like; however, all require that the PuTTY secure shell connection stays active for data to pass over the tunnel to the remote server. 

The steps above are represented as the following command on a UNIX system: 

ssh -L50000:localhost:23 my.test.server.com 

The steps above are represented as the following command on the QP2TERM/QP2SHELL/QSH command line: 

ssh -T -L50000:localhost:23 my.test.server.com
