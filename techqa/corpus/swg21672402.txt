Text:
arssyscr; Report Distribution TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running arssyscr -I instance_name -r during upgrade without RDF installed or enabled can lead to errors during load. 

SYMPTOM
You will see errors similar to (depending on database brand) 
DB Error: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist -- SQLSTATE=, SQLCODE=942, File=arsrddb.c, 
Line=951 in your systemlog


CAUSE
Issuing the arssyscr -I (instance name) -r command will trigger arssockd to check for the ARSDBBUNDT (RDF tables), which do not exist. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You will see the "table or view does not exist" errors in your Systemlog

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You will need to rename the Report Distribution tables and delete the Application, Application Group and Folders by performing the steps below:

You are going to want to change the Report Distribution table name: 

This test is done on DB2, but It should be the same for (Oracle or SQL 
Server). 
That is [2] and [3], to rename to object name, you need to log on your 
database command session: 


[1] Shutdown arssockd 

[2] Rename the Application Group name 

c:\>db2 "select agid, name, agid_name from arsag where name = 'System 
Report Distribution'" 
AGID NAME 
AGID_NAME 
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------ 
--------- 
5007 System Report Distribution 
SR 
1 record(s) selected. 


c:\>db2 "update arsag set name = 'System Report Distribution DELETE' 
WHERE name = 'System Report Distribution'" 
DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully. 


[3] Rename the Folder name 

c:\>db2 "select name from arsfol where name like 'System Report 
Distribution%'" 
NAME 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
System Report Distribution - Bundles 
System Report Distribution - Deliveries 
System Report Distribution - Reports 
3 record(s) selected. 

c:\>db2 "update arsfol set name = 'System Report Distribution - Bundles 
DELETE' where name = 'System Report Distribution - Bundles'" 
DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully. 

c:\>db2 "update arsfol set name = 'System Report Distribution - 
Deliveries DELETE' where name = 'System Report Distribution - 
Deliveries'" 
DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully. 

c:\>db2 "update arsfol set name = 'System Report Distribution - Reports 
DELETE' where name = 'System Report Distribution - Reports'" 
DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully. 

[3] Start up arssockd 

[4] Use the Admin GUI to delete the RD Application group, Applications, 
and Folders
