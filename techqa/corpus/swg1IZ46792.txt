ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  EKM 2.1
   
   EKM IPUG
   
   Problem:
   
   Error found in page 96 of EKM IPUG - section titled "Changing
   Keystore Passwords" in Chapter 3.
   
   The section seems to address only changing KEY password and does
   not specify the command syntax for changing KEYSTORE password.
   The section needs to be edited so it clearly states method to
   change keystore password as well as key passwords. Otherwise, if
   customer changes KEY password alone, EKM will fail to start as
   KEY password will no longer match KEYSTORE password.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Level 3 to update
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Error found in page 96 of EKM IPUG - section titled "Changing
   Keystore Passwords" in Chapter 3.
   
   The section seems to address only changing KEY password and does
   not specify the command syntax for changing KEYSTORE password.
   The section needs to be edited so it clearly states method to
   change keystore password as well as key passwords. Otherwise, if
   customer changes KEY password alone, EKM will fail to start as
   KEY password will no longer match KEYSTORE password.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The EKM IPUG section titled "Changing Keystore Passwords" need
   to add how to change the keystore password.
   
   The following section needs to be changed:
   
   Note: Once you have set the keystore password, do not change it
   unless it?s security has been breached. The passwords are
   obfuscated to eliminate any security exposure. Changing the
   keystore password requires that the password on every key in
   that keystore be changed individually using the following
   keytool command.
   
   To change the keystore password enter:
   
   keytool -keypasswd -keypass old_passwd -new new_passwd -alias
   alias -keystore keystorename -storetype keystoretype
   
   Then change the password for the keystore itself.  To change the
   storepass password enter:
   
   keytool -storepasswd -storepass old_storepasswd -new
   new_storepasswd -keystore keystorename -storetype keystoretype
   
   
   The EKM documentation is not being updated.  This APAR contains
   the latest information regarding changing the keystore password.
