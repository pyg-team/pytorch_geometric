   [1/28/16 17:22:26:369 CET] 00000013 PrivExAction  E
   J2CA0044E: The
   Connection Manager failed to get a Subject from the security
   service
   associated with ConnectionFactory
   jdbc/com.ibm.ws.sib/twprocsvr_bus.
   Received exception javax.security.auth.login.LoginException:
   Incorrect authDataEntry and alias is:
   PROCSVRME_MessagingCluster_Auth_Alias
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Problem can be circumvented by editing sib-engines.xml.
   Check in Websphere ISC the names of the authentication aliases
   configured in the system. Then check if those are matching the
   listed authentication aliases. There might be differences like
   listed below
   
   PERFDWME_bpme.Messaging_Auth_Alias
   PROCSVRME_bpme.MessagingCluster_Auth_Alias
   
   compared to
   
   PERFDWME_Messaging_Auth_Alias and
   PROCSVRME_MessagingCluster_Auth_Alias
   
   Changing the name of the Auth aliases fixes the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you create an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) deployment
    environment (DE) by using the IBM BPM DE wizard in the
   administrative console and modifying the name of the cluster
   that hosts the messaging infrastructure, the messaging engine
   configuration still points to the authentication data alias
   based on the default messaging cluster name, which does not
   exist. As a result, you see server startup errors.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An interim fix for IBM BPM V7.5.1.2 is available that ensures
   the messaging engine authentication alias name is configured
   consistently, based on the actual messaging cluster name.
