ABSTRACT
 Websphere Business Integration Adapter for Ariba Buyer version 3.2.4 has been updated. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION

This fix pack contains fixes to the following problems.

Version 3.2.4
87123
The adapter needs to provide a platform support statement for RedHat Linux on Intel. 

83108 
Child level verbs are not set by default in the business object. 

32899
The adapter should provide a connection configuration template.
86491
The IBM Channel is generating reply keys with the same value for consecutive messages. 

74223 
An "OutOfMemoryException" is generated when a large number of asynchronous events are pushed in a short period of time. The workaround prior to this fix was to disable timeouts. 

Version 3.2.3
46991 
When an operation fails, the adapter provides no details about the specific objects involved with the failure. 

50056 
The integration API in Buyer 8.2 is slightly different than in 8.1. This makes version 3.2 of the adapter incompatible with Buyer 8.2. 

50052
There is a one-to-one relationship between the channel and the connector instance. This restricts the configuration to exactly one set of queues. 

61406 
After applying Fix Pack 3.2.2, the ODA outputs business object definitions with top-level attributes in an unpredictable order. This causes an error when processing the business object at run time because the business object definitions might not match the structure of the incoming business object. 

50063 
The log or trace message is being constructed before the log or trace level is verified. In some cases this results in unnecessary processing. 

46701
Initdb cannot be run while Ariba server is running, because it unbinds the Channel Remote. Ariba Buyer must be restarted to resolve the problem. 

50053 
Certain objects are missing child objects when being pushed from the WebSphere Business Integration Channel. For example, ReceiptPush is missing its associated LineItems objects.

50054
Whenever an asynchronous event timeout occurs, the cleanup of system resources and logging is not being performed correctly.
