APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In sites that have dual online logging enabled, the IMS log
   reader component will only attempt to access a secondary OLDS if
    an I/O error is reported for a primary OLDS. Depending on what
   kind of DASD these logs are stored on, attempts to read data
   from the active OLDS that IMS is currently writing data to can
   cause contention that impacts IMS operations.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  A new OLDSPOLICY configuration parameter has been added that
   allows an administrator to identify whether the IMS log reader
   service should select secondary OLDS versus primary OLDS when
   dual logging is enabled for an IMS online subsystem.
   This new parameter also allows an administrator to identify
   whether the IMS log reader service should select an archive
   log versus an online log during stream activation processing.
   The following OLDSPOLICY options are available:
   1) Use primary OLDS and select an online log if available
   during stream activation (default)
   2) Use a secondary OLDS and select an online log if available
   during stream activation
   3) Use primary OLDS and select an archive log if available
   during stream activation
   4) Use a secondary OLDS and select an archive log if available
   during stream activation
   An update has been made to the OLDSPOLICY parameter to
   support this. The IBM Knowledge Center has been updated with
   the details for Version 11.3.
