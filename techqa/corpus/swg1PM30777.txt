PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 7.0 modifications will be available in the January 2011
   update to the Information Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 7.0 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: 684211
   Problem: The IBM HTTP Server Version 7.0 Information Center
   does not adequately explain the interaction of IBM HTTP
   Server with a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and how it
   assigns the SSLUnknownRevocationStatus directive.
   
   Resolution: The "SSL certificate revocation list" topic will
   be updated to better explain the behavior of the
   SSLUnknownRevocationStatus directive and how IBM HTTP Server
   assigns it. The section on SSLUnknownRevocationStatus will be
   updated to read the following:
   
   SSLUnknownRevocationStatus: This directive allows you to
   configure how IBM HTTP Server will respond when fresh
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) information or OCSP (Online
   Certificate Status Protocol) information is not available, and
   the client certificate that is currently offered is not known
   to be revoked from a previous query. Certificates are presumed
   not to be revoked, by default, which means they are valid, and
   a temporary failure to obtain CRL or OCSP information does not
   automatically result in an SSL handshake failure. This
   directive is provided to respond to circumstances in which a
   certificate has been accepted without IBM HTTP Server being
   able to reliably confirm the revocation status.
   
   This directive has an effect only when all of the following
   conditions are true:
   - IBM HTTP Server is configured to accept client certificates
   with the SSLClientAuth directive.
   - IBM HTTP Server is configured with one of the following
   directives: SSLOCSPEnable, SSLOCSPUrl, or SSLCRLHostname.
   - An SSL client certificate is provided.
   - IBM HTTP Server does not receive a valid OCSP or CRL
   response from the configured back-end server, and the client
   certificate is not revoked in a cached, but expired, CRL
   response.
   
   IBM HTTP Server uses a cached CRL that is beyond its published
   expiration time when a current version is not available. When
   a certificate has been revoked in an expired CRL, this a
   direct SSL handshake failure results that is outside the scope
   of the SSLUnknownRevocationStatus directive.

   ID: 685258
   Problem: The example of the default IIP response file,
   which is included in the "IIP installation response file"
   Version 7.0 Information Center topic, states the
   following information: "Enclose all values that contain spaces
   within a single pair of single quotation marks. Otherwise, no
   quotation marks are required." However, it does not indicate
   that if quotation marks are used when a value does not include
   spaces, the installation fails.
   
   Resolution: The example of the default IIP response file,
   which is included in the "IIP installation response file"
   Version 7 Information Center topic, will be updated to state
   the following information:
   "Enclose all values that contain spaces within a single pair
   of single quotation marks. Otherwise, no quotation marks are
   required. If quotation marks are used when a value does not
   include spaces, the installation fails." This same change will
   be made to the Version 6.1 Information Center.
   ----------
   
   ID: 683250
   Problem: The "Balancing workloads" and "Java virtual machine
   settings" topics in the Version 7.0 Information Center indicate
   that the com.ibm.websphere.wlm.unusable.interval property only
   applies to the z/OS environment. However this property
   actually applies for all WebSphere Application Server
   supported environments.
   
   Resolution: The z/OS icon will be removed from the
   descriptions of the com.ibm.websphere.wlm.unusable.interval
   property, which are included in the "Balancing workloads" and
   "Java virtual machine settings" topics. Removal of this icon
   will indicate that this property applies for all WebSphere
   Application Server supported environments.
   -----------
   
   ID: 684185
   Problem: When a JAX-WS application intercepts an inbound
   SOAPMessage and wants to manipulate it or form an attachment,
   SOAPMessageContext.setMessage is used. The
   SOAPMesssageContext.setMessage is described as getting the
   SOAPMessage from the message context with modifications to the
   returned SOAPMessage "changed in-place." This  &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;change in-p
   indication, while correct, excludes the need to subsequently
   use the setmessage part of the SOAPMessageContext again to
   ensure that the JAX-WS runtime processes the latest
   SOAPMessage content.
   
   Resolution: The "Using handlers in JAX-WS Web services" topic
   will be updated with a note to indicate that you must invoke
   SOAPMessageContext.setMessage to preserve the modifications
   you make to a SOAPMessage. The note text is as follows:
   
   Remember: If you intercept an inbound SOAPMessage and then
   manipulate it, such as adding an attachment part, you must use
   the setmessage part of the SOAPMessageContext to ensure that
   the attachment is part of the SOAPMessageContext. This
   approach ensures that the JAX-WS runtime can access this
   latest SOAPMessage so that it can properly process the
   attachment parts. The following example demonstrates this
   process:
   
   SOAPMessage m = context.getMessage();
   AttachmentPart ap1 = m.createAttachmentPart();
   ap1.setContent("abc", "text/plain");
   m.addAttachmentPart(ap1);
   context.setMessage(m);
