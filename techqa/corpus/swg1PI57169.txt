ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Portal v8.x server runtime target in JAX-WS client wizard
   generate error: Wsimport not found
   
   Using Rational Application developer (RAD) 9.5 to generate a
   JAX-WS web services client (into a portlet project) targeting
   WebSphere Portal 8.5(on WAS 8.5) ,  results in this pop-up error
   from the web services wizard:
   
   &#226; &#156;The Wsimport Web service tool was not found in the server
   installation. For WebSphere Application Server classic V8.5 and
   V8.0, verify the installation directory and its content. For
   WebSphere Application Server classic V7.0, ensure that the
   appropriate feature packs are installed for JAX-WS Web Services
   support. Once installed, the tool is available in:
   C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\jaxws&#226; &#157;
   
   
   Recreate:
   
   Recreate this error in RAD 9.5 by attempting to generate a
   JAX-WS Web Services client from any WSDL, against any WebSphere
   Portal 8.x server into any web project. It does not have to be a
   portlet project.
   Gives Error"
   
   "..
   The Wsimport Web service tool was not found in the server
   installation.
   For WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v8.5 and v8.0, verify the
   installation directory and its content.
   For WAS v7.0, ensure that the appropriate feature packs are
   installed for JAX-WS Web Services support.
   Once installed, the tool is available in: {WebSphere Portal
   Home}\AppServer\bin\jaxws
   .."
   
   Note: AppServer is the WAS 8.0 or WAS 8.5 used by Portal
   
   The key was that a  WPortal 8.x server runtime was specified.
   It seems to expect the wsimport to be in
   {WAS 8x server used by WPortal 8.x}\bin\jaxws folder
   , instead of
   {WAS 8x server used by WPortal 8.x}\bin\
   
   wsimport is always in .../AppServer/bin
   There is no .../AppServer/bin/jax-ws folder
   If the server runtime target is some WAS 8.x server there is no
   problem
   
   
   You can recreate this also by creating a web project targeting
   say the Portal80 on WAS85 stub
   in RAD (if Portal 8x stubs and WAS 8x stubs are installed as
   part of RAD server tools), and
   then generating a web service client from a wsdl into that
   project.
   
   Note:
   {RAD Install Dir}/runtimes/portal_v85_stub
   uses
   {RAD Install Dir}/runtimes/was85_stub
   ,for build or generate puposes.
   
   The error will be:
   "..
   The Wsimport Web service tool was not found in the server
   installation.
   For WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v8.5 and v8.0, verify the
   installation directory and its content.
   For WAS v7.0, ensure that the appropriate feature packs are
   installed for JAX-WS Web Services support.
   Once installed, the tool is available in: {RAD Install
   Dir}/runtimes/was85_stub\bin\jaxws
   .."
