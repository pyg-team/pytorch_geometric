Title: IBM SCA destinations for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), WebSphere Process Server (WPS) and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) are not preserved when uninstalling and reinstalling a service module - United States

SCA.RecycleDestinations; custom properties; SCA destinations; event sequencing; SCA modules; message queue TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a Service Component Architecture (SCA) module is uninstalled, by default, its associated destinations are removed, even if there are still messages in the destination queue. In some situations, such as when Event Sequencing is used, messages on the destinations must be preserved.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, use the SCA.recycleDestinations custom Javaâ„¢ virtual machine (JVM) property for the module. Set the property to false to preserve SCA destinations.
