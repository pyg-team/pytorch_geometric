   ****************************************************************
   The IPL exposes a problem due to missing file closes from CICS
   VR.  The file close is "missing" in that it wasn't logged.
   The file close wasn't logged because the system was IPLed.
   Before the IPL, IIDR for VSAM is tracking multiple files.
   After the IPL, IIDR for VSAM does not see the close for the
   file, but does reads a tieup record, and that leads to a
   duplicate in the indexed list tracking tieups by file.  It
   is an error to have the same file from the same applID
   associated with different DSNs, that is what the
   x0093000D is telling us.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Classic code is modified to fix the duplicate issue. In this
   case, we will assume closure occurred for the old instance
   of the tieup record and start tracking the new one.
   Classic will add diagnostic logging to let us know
   this happened.
