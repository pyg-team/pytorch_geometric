APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In WebSphere Application Server V6.0, a
   java.lang.NoSuchMethodException may occur when the Oracle 10g or
   11g JDBC driver is used.  This occurs because an Oracle 9i
   method, OracleLog.setLogVolume(), is called.  This method was
   removed from Oracle 10g and 11g.
   .
   This is a backport for APAR PK47930 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK47930] for WebSphere Application
   Server V6.1.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V6.0.2 and Oracle 10g and beyond     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WebSphere Application Server calls      *
   *                      Oracle9i APIs when running in a 10g and *
   *                      beyond environment.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Calling the Oracle9i API (OracleLog.setLogVolume()) results in
   a method not found exception in later Oracle drivers, where
   the method has been removed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix here consists of not calling the 9i API when running
   with Oracle 10g and beyond environments.
   
   Also customers must  make sure the datasource custom property
   oracle9iLogTraceLevel=null or blank, to avoid
   having the 9i API called.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 6.0.2.31  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
