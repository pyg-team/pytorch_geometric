CAUSE
The tag requiresSSL in the security.xml in was set to true.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the security configuration on the IBM WebSphere Application Server for the FileNet Workplace XT application. Check the setting requiresSSL to see whether it has been set to true or false.

    <singleSignon xmi:id="SingleSignon_1" requiresSSL="false" domainName="example.org" enabled="true"/>
    
 3. Save the security.xml file
    
    
 4. Restart the WebSphere Application Server.
