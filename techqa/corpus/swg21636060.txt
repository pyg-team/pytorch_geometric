PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rational Functional Tester v8.2 test script playback on ITCAM robotic player agent fails with BWMRF0125E error seen in TEP robotic workspace. 

SYMPTOM
1) BWM/logs/trace-robotic.log shows following errors concerning RFT "TEST" script playback for example :

BWMRF0125E An unknown internal error occurred in the Rational Functional Tester Playback

Bad return code. Expected 0, got return code=111

ftClient.downloadFile() returned a null FileInfo object! 

2) On the AMC (t3) agent, we checked the "depot" directory supposed to store TEST.zip script archive file that was exported from RFT WorkBench.
Actually the script was not uploaded as expected under <ITM_HOME>\kt1depot\T3\RFT 
RFT subdirectory actually didn't exist.

3) on the RRT (t6) agent, TEST.zip script archive file content was extracted in ./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/TEST directory, but it contains :
./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/TEST/configuration
and ./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/TEST/RFT subdirectories
which is not right... 


it should contains only 
./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/TEST/resources subdirectory. 


And all .java .class, .properties and configurations.rftcfg files
should be located in ./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/TEST directory, or more generally in ./tmaitm6/app/rft/scripts/<script name> directory, on the robotic player agent 

good example :
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=1]

bad example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=2]
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636060&aid=3]


CAUSE
RFT script was not created and exported to ITCAM using a valid RFT workspace/ functional test project environment



ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for Transactions V7.3
Rational Functional Tester V8.2
ITCAM4tx Robotic Response Time agent v7.3
ITCAM4tx Application Management Console agent v7.3
ITCAM4Tx Tivoli Rational Integration v7.3



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
see symptoms



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Solution found that proved successful has been to create a new RFT workspace directory (using RFT workbench "workspace launcher" window (at very beginning of RFT workbench start), 
and a new Functional Test Project (using File -> New -> Functional Test Project). 

Then record again the script using this new workspace/Functional test project environment, play it back manually, export the script to the AMC agent system;then playback was successful on robotic agent.
