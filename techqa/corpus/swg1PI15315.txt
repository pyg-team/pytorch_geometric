APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CPU usage can spike and cause performance degradation when new
   synchronous replicas request data from primary shards during
   startup.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TBD
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere eXtreme Scale users running with  *
   *                  the eXtreme IO (XIO) transport.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: New synchronous replicas that           *
   *                      aggressively copy data from the         *
   *                      primary shard can cause high CPU        *
   *                      usage.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   New synchronous replicas request data quickly from primary
   shards during startup. The aggressive replication can cause
   high CPU usage during this time. After a synchronous replica
   copies all the existing data from the primary shard, it
   receives data in real time from the primary shard, and the CPU
   returns to normal.
   Customers using asynchronous replicas can see a similar
   problem when primary shards move to new containers. The method
   of transferring an existing primary to a new location uses a
   temporary synchronous replica and can see high CPU usage
   during this time.
   This fix automatically regulates the replication rate based on
   how fast the primary shard responds to the synchronous replica
   in XIO environments.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Apply the interim fix.
