QUESTION
 How can I monitor the expiration of SSL Certificates (IIS) through IBM ITM Agents ? 

ANSWER
There is no ITM agent which can monitor for SSL Certificate expiration delivered out-of-the-box with ITM.

As alternative, you could try using one of the Data Source available with the Agent Builder to implement a custom agent to perform this task.
For example you can leverage on a custom script to execute the command required to verify if a certificate is expired or not, or the status of the certificate, and then have the custom agent parsing the script output to obtain the wanted information and display them on ITM TEP workspaces.
