ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reported Release: 623 FP1
   Environment:      ITM 623
   
   Problem Description:
   When the Watchdog code, which is part of the OS agent, is
   monitoring the Primary instance of the KMQ or KQI agent, the
   Process ID is displayed as 0 even when the instance is managed
   by Watchdog and the instance is running.  This can occur with
   the UNIX or Linux OS agents.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  KMQ and KQI Primary instance displays incorrect Process ID.
   
   When the Watchdog code, which is part of the OS agent, is
   monitoring the Primary instance of the WebSphere MQ Monitoring
   Agent (kmq), the Process ID is displayed as 0 even when the
   instance is managed by Watchdog and the instance is running.
   This can occur with the UNIX or Linux OS agents.  When Watchdog
   is monitoring the Primary instance of the WebSphere Message
   Broker Monitoring Agent (kqi), the Process ID is displayed as
   either 0 or the Process ID of another KQI instance that is
   running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to correctly determine the Process ID of
   the Primary instance of the WebSphere MQ Monitoring Agent (kmq)
   and WebSphere Message Broker Monitoring Agent (kqi) agents.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
      | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0003
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Watchdog can be disabled until the fix can be applied.
   - Edit the < lz | ux >.ini and comment out the line that starts
   with KCA_CAP_DIR.
     (Note the value on the right might have a slightly different
   value based on the release).
   #  KCA_CAP_DIR=$CANDLEHOME$/config/CAP:/opt/IBM/CAP
   - Stop and restart the OS Agent
