APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To configure a WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS application to
   connect to a queue manager over a secure socket, the application
   selects a specific CipherSuite to use.
   
   However the specific CipherSuites which was selected maps to
   multiple CipherSpecs. The WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS API
   provides no mechanism by which the specific CipherSpec which is
   negotiated between the application and queue manager can be
   chosen.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This affect users of WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS, at
   versions 7.0.1, 7.1 and 7.5 trying to use the following
   CipherSuite -> CipherSpec mappings:
   
   CipherSuite CipherSpec
   ----------- ----------
   SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA256
   
   when the JVM is not operating in FIPS mode.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The CipherSuites in the list above can each be used to map with
   2 different queue manager CipherSpecs - one which utilises the
   SSLv3 protocol, and one the TLS protocol.
   
   The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS configuration only
   permitted the mapping to the CipherSpec which utilised the TLS
   mapping if the JVM FIPS mode was enabled, despite this not being
   a prerequisite for these ciphers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS have been updated, such
   that the TLS usage mapping for the above
   CipherSuites/CipherSpecs can now be used if the JVM property:
   
       com.ibm.mq.cfg.preferTLS
   
   is set to true.
   
   
   For example, to set this property for the application
   "MyApplication" started from the command line, you would use the
   following syntax:
   
   java -Dcom.ibm.mq.cfg.preferTLS=true MyApplication
