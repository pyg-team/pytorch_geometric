QUESTION
 The DB2 10.1 license used for ITM data warehouse was a trial version and it now expired.
Where can I download a valid DB2 license to use with ITM ? Can ITM support provide a licensed DB2 package ? 

ANSWER
Customer support can neither send product installation packages nor provide the DB2 product license. 

Anyway you should be able to obtain one from Passport Advantage:

For what concern ITM, if you have a valid ITM license, you can download DB2 installation package from Passport Advantage portal as well.
For Example, the part number for the DB2 that shipped with ITM 6.3 is C171NML: 

IBM DB2 10.1 Enterprise Server Edition Quick Start and Activation Assembly, Multiplatform, Multilingual 

See the ITM 6.3 Quick Start manual for additional details
