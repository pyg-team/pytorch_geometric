Note: ClearQuest EmailRelay was introduced in ClearQuest 8.0.0.3. REMEDIATION/FIXES
ClearQuest Web and ClearQuest EmailRelay use the Java runtime that is included with WebSphere Application Server. Follow instructions for updating your version of WebSphere Application Server to a version that includes the fixes. 


For ClearQuest 7.1.x 
These releases ship with, install and configure WAS version 6.1.0.25. Review technote 1390803: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803] How to update the IBM WebSphere Application Server components in Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest 7.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803]

For ClearQuest 8.x 
These releases use an installation of WAS separately installed and maintained from the ClearQuest installation. 

Determine the version of WAS that your deployment is using and follow the instructions at
Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java SDK affect WebSphere Application Server October 2014 CPU [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687740] to update your version of the JRE supplied by WAS. This applies for all versions of ClearQuest Web Server greater than and inclusive of v7.1.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.
