It is important for you to have your systems up to date containing the latest features and fixes to previously reported problems. To achieve a great upgrade experience, you must perform a pre-upgrade check on the system two to seven days prior to the scheduled upgrade date. The pre-upgrade checks are non-intrusive and can be run while the system is online. It helps determine any current issues on the systems and allows time to fix any identified issues.
