APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have Windows set to French(Canada) locale.
   If I change the default Settings in the Statistics output node -
   Pearson Correlation, and I redefine the thresholds for each
   label, and run the node a first time, I get certain results. If
   I open the node again, open the settings window again, and close
   both, and run the node again, I get different labels.
