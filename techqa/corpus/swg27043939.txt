 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 When running the Case Manager Platform Installation Tool on Windows, the installer might fail at step 9/38 , which is the step that runs ConfigP8DB.bat.

The log entries from the installer will show this error: 

Install-InvokeDescription: (9/38) configP8DB2.bat
...
...
OUTPUT>C:\Program Files\IBM\tdsV6.3db2\BIN>db2 CONNECT TO GCD_DB
OUTPUT>SQL1031N The database directory cannot be found on the indicated file system.

In checking the Windows event logs, you will notice that the database, DB2TDS63, could not be started due to an 'unknown system error'.

Workaround:
1. Manually start DB2 database instance for DB2TDS63 after the failed install, which will be successful.
2. Remove the cmpit.properties file from IBM Case Manager Platform Installation Tool folder where you ran the 5.2.1-CMPIT-WIN.exe.
3. Replace the existing file it with the cmpit.properties from C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\install-scripts directly.
4. Restart the cmpit install, and it will continue at step 9 completing the install.
