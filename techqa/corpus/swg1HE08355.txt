APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If IBM Content Collector is configured to collect documents from
   public folders on a Microsoft Exchange 2007 or 2010 server,
   Content Collector might return the following error message:
   
   "AFUM0022E: An error occurred: The entry ID of the primary
   message store could not be found in the message store table."
   
   On Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 servers, public folder stores
   do not exist by default. As a result, a MAPI profile that is
   created against Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 does not usually
   contain the public folder store provider. If this information is
   missing, IBM Content Collector returns an error when trying to
   access the public folders.
   
   The public folder store provider is added to the MAPI profile
   when the profile user's mailbox is opened for the first time.
   After that and a new session logon, IBM Content Collector can
   access the public folders without error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround:
   
   As a workaround, start Microsoft Outlook with the IBM Content
   Collector profile and open the mailbox of the Content Collector
   user to add the required information to the profile.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If IBM Content Collector was configured to collect documents
   from public folders on a Microsoft Exchange 2007 or 2010
   server, Content Collector in some cases returned the following
   error message:
   
   "AFUM0022E: An error occurred: The entry ID of the primary
   message store could not be found in the message store table."
   
   On Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 servers, public folder stores
   do not exist by default. As a result, a MAPI profile that is
   created against Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 does not usually
   contain the public folder store provider. If this information
   is missing, IBM Content Collector returns an error when trying
   to access the public folders.
   
   The public folder store provider is added to the MAPI profile
   when the profile user's mailbox is opened for the first time.
   After that and a new session logon, IBM Content Collector can
   access the public folders without error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, Content Collector provides an
   environment variable named AFU_EX_ADD_PF_TO_PROFILE. When this
   environment variable is set, the IBM Content Collector Email
   Connector service automatically creates the store provider
   entry in the profile.
