Title: IBM ICM query: De-referencing multiple item types for sources or targets of links - United States

Text:
dereference; =>; de-reference; traverse link; traverse inbound; traverse outbound TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I specify multiple item types as the target of my link in my query string? When I de-reference an inbound or outbound link, can I list more than one link type? 

CAUSE
You can only de-reference links in query directly to a single link type or the '*' wild card for all item types.

ANSWER
Use a single item type when de-referencing a link. Then union together the same query for all item types that you are interested in. 

For example, suppose you want to find all Books & Journals within a particular folder: 

 * 
 * 
 * myFolder[@ITEMID="12345..."]/OUTBOUNDLINK[@LINKTYPE = "DKFolder"]/@TARGETITEMREF => Books UNION /myFolder[@ITEMID="12345..."]/OUTBOUNDLINK[@LINKTYPE = "DKFolder"]/@TARGETITEMREF => Journals
