ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are trying to install and license Statisitcs 21.0 from
   behind a proxy and you need to be able to supply the proxy
   hostname, port, user, and password to the licenseactivator.exe.
   Your problem is that only the PROXYUSER and PROXYPASS arguments
   are documented in the SPSS Statistics Installation Guide.
   
   In reality, licenseactivator.exe has four (4) main arguments.
   These can be found by issuing the /help switch from command
   line:
   
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\21>licenseactivator /help
   Run this from the installation directory to activate
   authorization code or add a
    license code.
   
   licenseactivator code1[:code2:...upto...:code10]
   PROXYHOST=[proxy-hostname] PROXYPORT=[proxy-port-number]
   PROXYUSER=[proxy-username] PROXYPASS=[proxy-password]
   
   
   Optional Proxy Paramaters:
   
   PROXYHOST       Proxy Server Name or IP address.
   PROXYPORT       Proxy Server port number used to connect to the
   internet.
   PROXYUSER       If required Proxy Server username.
   PROXYPASS       If required Proxy Server password.
   
   Additional Paramaters:
   
   INITMODE        Used to initialize the machine only.
   DEBUGMODE       Used to run with debugging turned on.
   
   !Note: Before entering a license code, all characters after '#'
   should be removed or add quotes around each License code.
