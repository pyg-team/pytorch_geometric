Title: IBM RUN maps are not multi-threaded as expected - United States

Text:
WTX ITX Launcher Event Server Multi-thread RUN map TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the RUN() function in IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) to call child maps it may be observed that they are not being multi-threaded as expected. This is seen when using a FILE adapter override, without a target file name being specified and the 'do not create' option, such as -OF1X for example. 

SYMPTOM
RUN maps are not multi-threaded as expected.


CAUSE
Using the -OF1X override when executing RUN maps. 

-OF1X means override the adapter for output card 1 and use the FILE adapter, use the file name compiled into the map and when the map completes, do not create the file. 

The Resource Manager detects that the same output file name is being used for multiple threads of RUN() map, and makes them all wait in turn to use that resource name (despite the fact that the file is never actually written). 


ENVIRONMENT
Using the IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Launcher and Multi-Thread is enabled.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using the ITX Launcher and multi-threading is enabled. You can see temporary files for the each ITX Map (Mer*) but can only see one set of temporary files for the RUN Maps (Run*). 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can use a SINK adapter override (such as -OASINK1) instead or a unique file name for the FILE adapter override and then the RUN maps should multi-thread as expected.
