Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx ISM SNMP monitor : double quotes in OID group are not accepted - United States

Text:
ITM ITCAM ITCAM4Tx double quote character quotation mark 71ISM-CONF; 71ISM-GEN TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using ISM agent and the TEP ISM Configuration GUI interface for example, we can not create a SNMP monitor while specifying a OID group containing double quotes (") character in it. 

SYMPTOM
Using ITM Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) and the ISM configuration GUI interface, when trying to define a OID group like for example : 

x.x.x.x.x.x.x."TEST"."T1" defaultOID1 unit 

it refuses and says : 

Invalid OID value. it does not match regexp [a-zA-Z0-9_/.-]* 

x.x.x.x.x.x.x."TEST.T1 

Remark: 

snmpwalk utility accepts double quotes usage, actually by using single quote to surround/ include double quotes, like for example : 

snmpwalk -M /opt/IBM/ITM/li6263/is/mibs/ -<options> <Ip_address> x.x.x.x.x.x.x.'"TEST"."T1"'


CAUSE
Currently ISM 7.3 does not support the setting of string values in OIDs with double quotes character in it


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Tivoli Monitoring, ITCAM for Transactions and ISM (Internet Service Monitoring) agent



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
see symptom



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A possible solution, and current best way, based on the used example, is to specify the OID as 

x.x.x.x.x.x.x.4.84.69.83.84.2.84.49 

As that will be what the command line utility expands it to. 

Explanation: 

In this example, you have two string based indexes on that object. One is TEST and the other is T1 

To convert them to an Object Id is done by putting the length followed by the ASCII value of each character, so we get 

4 - length index 1 

84 = T 

69 = E 

83 = S 

84 = T 

2 = length index 2 

84 = T 

1 = 49 

So using the ISM GUI configuration tool, you need to enter as OID group the string : 

x.x.x.x.x.x.x.4.84.69.83.84.2.84.49 

instead of 

x.x.x.x.x.x.x."TEST"."T1"
