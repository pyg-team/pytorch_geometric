APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While running WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) on Solaris with a
   WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) node in your message
   flow, you notice that some messages cause the Execution Group
   (EG) to abend. The abend file will show that a signal 11 was
   received; the top of the stack output will show 'mqmcpy'. After
   the EG has restarted and the message has backed out, you find
   that sending the failed message through again completes without
   error.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: While executing a message flow with a   *
   *                      WebSphere Transformation Extender map   *
   *                      execution group terminates with an      *
   *                      abend file. Abend file shows Signal     *
   *                      11 or memory allocation failure as      *
   *                      the cause of the failure. A user may    *
   *                      find function DstxXMLDocHandlerImpl     *
   *                      in the abend stack. This problem        *
   *                      occurs due to a defect in the XML4C     *
