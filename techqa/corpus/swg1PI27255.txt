ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 FP1 on a Windows 7 64 bit
   computer. The program was installed by a user who is member of
   the local administrator group of the machine but due to other
   operating system restrictions this user has for example no full
   write permission on C:\Program Files etc.
    On Utilities - Custom Dialogs - Custom Dialog Builder (CDB) you
   create a new dialog and save the SPD file on a local location
   Use File - Save As and save the SPD file as e.g. dialog1.spd on
   e.g. C:\users\<user name>\documents folder
   Then, still on CDB you click File - Install
   
   You are informed that the dialog is installed to C:\Users\<user
   name>\AppData\Local\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\22\CustomDialogs\dialog1
   
   Your installed dialog works fine.
   However when you go back to  Utilities - Custom Dialogs - Custom
   Dialog Builder and click on 'Open Installed' dialog
   your custom dialog will not open. You can only the other
   installed dialogs which come with program installtion this way.
   Nothing happens when you select your SPD file on Open Installed
   Dialog. The canvas of CDB stays blank
   This does only happen when you use the File - Open Installed
   (Open installed Dialog) menu.
   When you use the File - Open menu (Open a dialog specification)
   instead and select the dialog1.spd from the local path were you
   saved it will open
   Also when you use the folder icon (open saved dialog) on CDB and
   locate your SPD file it will open and you can edit it.
