Title: IBM Slow Oracle queries:  how to optimize an Oracle database - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 When I do a query against my Oracle library server, it takes 15 or more seconds for a simple query to complete. It did not take that long before. 

CAUSE
A database table can become fragmented after many updates, causing the query performance to deteriorate. Queries might take longer because index entries in the library server and resource manager are no longer synchronized with the actual data in the database tables.

ANSWER
For an Oracle database, you can use the tools provided by Oracle to update the indexes and re-order as necessary. Below are the SQL commands that can improve the performance of your system. To use the commands, you must log in as sysdba. You should work with your Oracle DBA to add these SQL commands to a batch process to be run periodically. 

In the following commands, replace ICMADMIN with the library server database administration ID, and replace RMADMIN with your resource manager database administration ID.

Library server: 

 * execute dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats (ownname=>'ICMADMIN', method_opt=>'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE 1',granularity=>'ALL', options=>'GATHER', cascade=>TRUE, degree=>16); 
 * execute dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats (ownname=>'SYS', method_opt=>'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE 1',granularity=>'ALL', options=>'GATHER', cascade=>TRUE, degree=>16); 
 * execute dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats (ownname=>'SYSTEM', method_opt=>'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE 1',granularity=>'ALL', options=>'GATHER', cascade=>TRUE, degree=>16);


Resource manager:  * execute dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats (ownname=>'RMADMIN', method_opt=>'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE 1',granularity=>'ALL', options=>'GATHER', cascade=>TRUE, degree=>16);
