APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When converting an existing server as a first member of a
   cluster the following errors occur:
   1. CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue JMS Queue does not have the
   Queue name updated with the correct SIB Queue destination
   2. CommonEventInfrastructure_AllEventsTopic JMS Topic does not
   have the Topic space updated with the correct SIB Topic
   destination
   
   Both SIB destinations are not "moved" from server-scope to
   cluster-scope although the cluster-scope SIB destinations are
   created.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IBM WebSphere Application Server version     *
   *                 6.1 Common Event Infrastructure (CEI) users  *
   *                 who want to create a cluster from a          *
   *                 standalone WebSphere Application Server      *
   *                 profile that has CEI deployed, by            *
   *                 converting this standalone Application       *
   *                 Server to the first member of the cluster.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You cannot use CEI anymore after        *
   *                      creating a cluster from a standalone    *
   *                      WebSphere Application Server profile    *
   *                      that has Common Event Infrastructure    *
   *                      (CEI) deployed, by converting this      *
   *                      standalone profile to the first member  *
   *                      of the cluster.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you encounter this problem while          *
   *                 creating the cluster from a standalone CEI   *
   *                 WebSphere Application Server by converting   *
   *                 this standalone Application Server to the    *
   *                 first member of the cluster, it is           *
   *                 recommended to install fix pack which        *
   *                 contains this fix.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   The service integration bus (SIB) destination associated with
   the JMS CEI queue and the SIB topic space associated with the
   CEI topic space are not updated when the 'creatCluster' task
   extension is called. The  'createCluster' task is called when
   a stand alone server, that has CEI deployed is promoted to
   first cluster member. This means that the CEI's JMS queue,
   CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue, resource does not have the
   Queue name updated with the correct associated queue on the
   Service Integration Bus (SIB) and topic resource,
   CommonEventInfrastructure_AllEventsTopic, does not have the
   Topic space updated with the correct topic space that contains
   the topic, on the service integration bus defined by the Bus
   name property, both cluster-scoped.
   Both resources have the old server-scoped SIB destinations
   that are not available any more, because the 'creteCluster'
   task extension removes these resources.
   It happens because when 'createCluster' task is executed, CEI
   extension verifies if the  CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue /
   CommonEventInfrastructure_
   AllEventsTopic exists in the resources, without checking if
   the associated SIB destinations of these resources are in the
   cluster scope and leaves them defined like they were, in the
   server scope.
   This task extension, 'createCluster', removes the actual
   server scoped SIB destinations and creates the new cluster
   scoped SIB destinations, so CEI will not be able to publish
   events.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Applying the associated fix will update the SIB destinations
   of CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue and
   CommonEventInfrastructure_AllEventsTopic in the resources.
   Now when creating a cluster from a standalone WebSphere
   Application Server that has CEI deployed by converting it to
   the first member of the cluster, the CEI task extension in
   charged will make sure that  the SIB destinations of
   CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue and CommonEventInfrastructure_
   AllEventsTopic are correctly scoped.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.1.0.9.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Once you created the cluster from a standalone WebSphere
   Application Server that has CEI deployed by converting it to
   the first member of the cluster, open the Admin Console. Here
   navigate to Resources, JMS, Queues,
   CommonEventInfrastructure_Queue and select <ClusterName>.
   CommonEventInfrastructureQueueDestination from the Queue name
   drop-down list.
   Navigate to Resources, JMS, Topic,  CommonEventInfrastructure_
   AllEventsTopic and select <ClusterName>.
   CommonEventInfrastructureTopicDestination from the Topic space
   drop-down list.
   Where <ClusterName> represents the name of the cluster you
   created.
