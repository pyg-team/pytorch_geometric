ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Headline:
   Memory leak observed in Rhapsody 8.0
   
   
   Abstract:
   Attempts to use Rhapsody continuously for some hours results in
   Performance Issue
   
   
   Error_description:
   Rhapsody slows down considerably after using for a few hours on
   Windows XP. The reason is analysed to the fact that it keeps
   occupying more and more memory after subsequent
   actions....Finally it reaches a stage when even simple actions
   such as performing an 'Add to Model' or moving the cursor takes
   2 minutes.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   Try1:
   I opened C++ model ?HomeAlarmWithPorts?. Memory used by Rhapsody
   = 17452 Kb.
   I open then OMD named: ?home alarm overview?. Memory used by
   Rhapsody = 27172 Kb.
   I close this OMD. Memory used by Rhapsody = 27160 Kb.
   I open again the same OMD (home alarm overview). Memory used by
   Rhapsody = 27204 Kb.
   I close again this OMD. Memory used by Rhapsody = 27164 Kb.
   I open again OMD named : home alarm overview. Memory used by
   Rhapsody = 27392 Kb.
   I close again this OMD. Memory used by Rhapsody = 27380 Kb.
   
   Try2:
   Tried to reproduce with a simple sample model and the results
   are more bad. Memory used shows as high as 47,000Kb while
   Rhapsody is launched..Opening a model shoots to 99,300 Kb.
   Closing the model brings it down to only 99,100Kb. Next time we
   open a model, it increases from 99,100 to 1,03,000 and so on...
   
   The cycle keeps increasing.
   
   This is potentially a big problem if huge models are opened.
   
   
   
   Workaround:
   High risk for Rhapsody to crash.
   Decreases work efficiency.
