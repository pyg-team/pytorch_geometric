 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on June 11, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by WebSphere MQ 5.3 (HPNSS) has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-1788 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1788]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing an ECParameters structure over a specially crafted binary polynomial field. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103778 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103778] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
CVEID: CVE-2015-1789 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1789]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted certificate or CRL to trigger a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1791 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1791]
DESCRIPTION: A double-free memory error in OpenSSL in the ssl3_get_new_session_ticket() function has an unknown impact. By returning a specially crafted NewSessionTicket message, an attacker could cause the client to reuse a previous ticket resulting in a race condition.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103609 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103609] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
