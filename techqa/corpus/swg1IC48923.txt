ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  THIS IS A DEFECT ON DESIGN OF THE HTML REPORTS.
   
   I have created a RFE RATLC00144658, but it was resolved,
   probable because misunderstanding of the
   problem. This is a defect
   on the entire design of the HTML Reports (and the other Test
   results).  The reports are not intuitive, they are confusing and
   difficult to read.  The customer writes:
   
   The HTML reports issues are collectively one defect or
   problem, not an enhancement.
   Reading the HTML report in my web browser is very confusing.
   
   Below are specific issues that the customer also reports. I have
   created separate RFEs for each detailed issue, but again the
   problem is that the HTML Reports are not intuitive and difficult
   to follow. It would be worth to redesign it.
   
   The customer is: Girard Jason <jason.g@motorola.com>
   
   
   A number of specific issues that are reported in different RFEs:
   
   Hello,
   I am validating RT's ability to clearly generate/present HTML
   reports,
   and am using version 2003.06.13 on Solaris.
   I have a parent C++ project, containing 3 C sub-projects, and 2
   C++
   sub-projects. All 5 projects are relatively simple in nature. A
   couple
   projects involve the same unit/file under test, but in one
   project being
   tested with stubbing, and one without stubbing. I built and
   executed
   the projects from the parent project in the RT GUI.
   
   Attached is a zip file with the artifacts from the parent
   project:
   "Container". I exported the HTML report for the entire parent
   project's
   contents. I noticed several things out of place or incorrect in
   the
   reports that are generated. I am also attaching a zip file of
   one of
   the sub-projects, Add_c.
   
   First, in the first C sub-project, called "Add_c", I have only
   one test
   case in the .ptu file; however, the Performance Profile iin the
   RT GUI s
   showing 5 tests...why? The same question applies regarding the
   Memory
   Profile...it is showing 5 tests.
   
   Second, from the base directory's index.html file, I clicked the
   link to
   "Performance Profile". This took me to the Qvi/index.html file.
   There are some problems here. Again, the 5 tests in some
   projects is
   showing up. Also, the numbering is very odd...once the bold
   number gets
   to 9, the next number is 01, then it goes to 11, then 21, then
   31, and
   when it gets to 91, it goes to 02, 12, and so on.
   In addition to this, there needs to be a separator of some kind
   in the
   Performance Profile HTML page, so I know which results are
   coming from
   which sub-projects/nodes.
   
   Going back to the main index.html page, when I click on the
   "Code
   Coverage" link, it displays several files from among the
   projects/nodes. It is not clear which files were covered by
   which
   projects/nodes...this needs to be separated/labeled as such.
   The same comment applies to the data displayed from the "Rates
   Table"
   link in the upper right.
   
   Going back to the main index.html page, when I clicked on the
   "Test"
   link, the table is showing a bunch of "Test.xrd" links, which is
   ok, as
   each test node in each sub-project was named "Test", but the
   table
   should at least spell out which Test.xrd came from which
   project/node.
   Also, I noticed that some of the Test.xrd are hyperlinked to the
   SAME
   file (i.e. addx1.html) while the results in the table are
   different.
   
   Going back to the main index.html page, when I clicked on the
   "Memory
   Profile" link, the same comments apply as for the "Performance
   Profile"
   regarding the apparent duplication of tests, numbering
   weirdness, and
   separation/labeling of projects/nodes.
   
   I am requesting to put this as a high priority fix, as it will
   impact
   our ability to make heads or tails of the HTML reports.
   
   Thanks,
   Jason
