QUESTION
 What factors influence the time for a Cognos Business Intelligence Content Store upgrade? 

ANSWER
It depends on many factors.
1. Number of reports. Reports contain specifications, properties, security settings, and outputs.
2. Number of report packages. Packages contain metadata, reports, and folders.
3 Number of agents. Agents include the conditions, schedules, and tasks that are used to monitor events and deliver notifications.
4. Server configuration. Server configuration contains directory information, the Cognos namespace and information about contacts, distribution lists, data sources, and printers.
5. The amount of user information. Personal user information consists of My Folders and My Pages.
6. Language information.

The following external factors can affect the upgrade time as well.

1. The number and speed of system processors.
2. Storage device configuration.
3. The type of workload that the server can handle. A workload that consists of large numbers of small files, or files with very long file names, can cause a relatively longer upgrade time.

The database's scripts (dbUpgrade*) executed during the upgrade are present under, configuration\schemas\content\"database"\ folder (change" database" by Oracle or Sql server or your database type)
