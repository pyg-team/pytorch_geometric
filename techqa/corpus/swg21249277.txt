PROBLEM
The following error is written to the Lotus Domino server console: 

"Java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences checkLockFile0ErrorCode WARNING: Could not lock System prefs. Unix error code"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following is a release note that details an issue with Java errors within Domino on UNIX (AIX, z/OS, Solaris): 

This error occurs because the JRE looks for security settings in /etc/.java and $HOME/.java by default. However, Domino installs its own JRE within the Notes Executable directory (/opt/lotus/notes/latest/PLAT/jvm), and installs System Preferences files there. 

On some UNIX platforms if a JDK/JRE is installed locally for the Operating System, then this install may create a /etc/.java directory which is owned/writeable by root. Since Domino does not run as root, it is unable to lock the preferences file in this directory hierarchy, resulting in the above error message.

Additionally, the deinstallation of a JDK/JRE on a UNIX platform may leave behind this directory structure, but with incomplete/missing files/hierarchy, causing the same or similar error. For example, it may leave behind /etc/.java/.systemPrefs without containing the files .system.lock and .systemRootModFile.

Currently, there is no clear way to deal with this issue programmatically in Domino, due to the many ways Domino accesses Java functionality. It is recommended that you either: 

 * Remove /etc/.java and use local user preferences only, either in $HOME or just with what comes packaged with Domino (preferred) 
 * Recursively make /etc/.java globally readable/writeable/executable, but you will still be susceptible to the incomplete/missing files/hierarchy issue described above.
