Title: IBM Installation of TSAAM 4.1 fails installing DASH - United States

Text:
TSAAM; DASH; JazzSM; XMing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Silent installation of JazzSM 1.1.0.2 to Install Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) fails when Xming server is running on local workstation. The silent installation is successful when X-Server is stopped on local workstation. 

SYMPTOM
DASH silent installation fails with error 

JVM terminated. Exit code=1 


CAUSE
The DASH installation needs to bring up browser with the DASH login page. But the installer first checks if any browser is installed on the system using Java AWT API. This Java AWT API makes connections to X-Server even in case of a silent installation. As X-Server connections are very sensitive, connection resets during installation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two possible workarounds 


1) Stop X-Server on the local system and then perform the DASH silent installation.

2) If 1) is not possible, do the following 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * export DISPLAY=”10.10.10.10:0”
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * export IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.awt.headless=true
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

Once install is done, above environment values can be reset. 
JazzSM does not use these values during runtime.
