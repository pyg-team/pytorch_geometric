PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
WebSphere Adapters can be deployed as:
-> Embedded Adapter
-> stand-alone Adapter

The differences between the embedded adapter and stand-alone adapter are :
Embedded Adapter: An embedded adapter is bundled within an enterprise archive (EAR) file and is available only to the application with which it is packaged and deployed.

Stand-alone Adapter: A stand-alone adapter is represented by a stand-alone resource adapter archive (RAR) file, and when deployed, it is available to all deployed applications in the server instance.

Choosing either to embed an adapter with your application or to deploy the adapter as a stand-alone module depends on how you want to administer the adapter.

Suppose the customer has many adapters either it can be Stand-alone or Embedded installed. Let say they have Flat File 7.0.0.3( having AFC version as 7.0.0.0) and SAP 7.0.0.3( having AFC version as 7.0.0.1_IF02). The ideal case is both the adapters must contain the same version of AFC. Basically uniformity of the AFC version must be maintain across all the adapters. 
In the above case, AFC version has to be maintain as 7.0.0.0 or 7.0.0.1_IF02 in both Flat File as well as SAP adapters. 
Mulitple adapters( having differenct AFC versions) deployed in the same server will effect the proper working of the adapters. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem can be avoid by maintaining the consistency between the AFC of all the deployed adapters. 

Note: The adapter will not throw the exception in case of adapter version 7.0.0.4 and version 7.5 (and above). In these version, the adapter will not get start and throw the Version Conflict Exception in the logs
