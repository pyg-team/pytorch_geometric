SUMMARY
 IBM Rational DOORS contains multiple security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Rational DOORS is affected by the following vulnerabilities disclosed in and corrected by Rational DOORS fix pack releases:
CVE ID: CVE-2014-3613 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3613]

Description: cURL/libcURL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly detect and reject domain names for IP addresses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to send cookies to an incorrect site. 

CVSS Base Score: 5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95925 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95925] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
-------------------------------------
CVE ID: CVE-2014-3620 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3620]

Description: cURL/libcURL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by cookies being set for Top Level Domains (TLDs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to send cookies to a different and unrelated site or domain. 

CVSS Base Score: 5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95924 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95924] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
-------------------------------------
CVE ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]

Description: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
-------------------------------------
CVE ID: CVE-2014-9495 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9495]

Description: Libpng is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the png_combine_row function when decompressing the IDAT_data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a "very wide interlaced" PNG image to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS Base Score: 9.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99699 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99699] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
-------------------------------------
CVE ID: CVE-2015-0973 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0973]

Description: Libpng is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the png_read_IDAT_data() function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using IDAT data with a large width to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100239 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100239] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational DOORS versions 9.3.0.x, 9.4.0.x, 9.5.0.x, 9.5.1.x, 9.5.2.x, 9.6.0.x, 9.6.1.0. 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Upgrade to one of the following Rational DOORS fix packs to avoid this vulnerability.



Affected Rational DOORS version Rational DOORS fix pack contains fix 9.3.0.x 9.3.0.9 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039527] 9.4.0.x 9.4.0.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039525] 9.5.0.x 9.5.0.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039524] 9.5.1.x 9.5.1.4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039523] 9.5.2.x 9.5.2.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039522] 9.6.0.x 9.6.0.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039521] 9.6.1.0 9.6.1.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039514] 
To avoid the vulnerability that is referenced in CVE-2014-8730, you can set an environment variable, as described in Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects IBM Rational DOORS (CVE-2014-8730) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692972]. This fix is not required if you upgrade to the fix pack, as described in this section. If you are using Rational DOORS Web Access, after you upgrade but before you start the Rational DOORS Web Access server, edit the core configuration file and set the required version of the interoperation server to the version of the fix pack upgrade, as described in this procedure. 

Procedure: 

 1. To edit the Rational DOORS Web Access core configuration file, open the festival.xml file, which is in the server\festival\config directory.
    
 2. Add the following line in the <f:properties> section:
    
    <f:property name="interop.version" value="9.n.n.n"/>
    
    Replace "9.n.n.n" with the version of the fix pack upgrade: 9.3.0.9, 9.4.0.3, 9.5.0.3, 9.5.1.4, 9.5.2.3, 9.6.0.2, or 9.6.1.1.
    
 3. Save and close the file. 


After this revision, only the specified version of the interoperation server can access the Rational DOORS database.
