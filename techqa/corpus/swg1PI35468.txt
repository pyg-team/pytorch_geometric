APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v8.5.1.5, Java heap
   usage grows overtime until user disconnects when copybooks are
   not found.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1- configure a SYSLIB in a property group with datasets where
   copybooks will not be found.
   2- In LPEX or COBOL Editor, edit a COBOL program containing a
   lot of copybooks and associated to this property group
   3- close the editor
   4- check Java heap usage on the host with operator command
   F RSED,APPL=D P,D
   5- repeat steps 2 to 4 and observe that the heap grows
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Java heap is released when user disconnects

   ****************************************************************
   01.As unneeded RSE objects should be either deleted or
      registered as sprit object, RDz v9 server does both
      operations on RSE objects that are used to get copybook
      contents, when the copybook member is not found in any
      specified syslibs.
   02.By the internal change for the console command processing,
      MODIFY rsed,APPL=D C does not show any message.
   03.In the RDz server, READ() I/O failed with wrong length
      against empty sequential dataset.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.RDz v9 server is updated not to delete the unneeded RSE
      objects used to get copybook content, when the sprit
      function is enabled and the copybook member is not found.
   02.The server code for f rsed,appl=d c is updated to adapt to
      the new logic to handle console commands.
   03.Usually, in reading empty sequential dataset, EndOfData
      condition will be raised but in the special attribute
      dataset, READ() I/O fails in a wrong length. Now, RDz server
      assumes the above special condition as EndOfData.
