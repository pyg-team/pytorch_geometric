APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. on the knowledge center DOC page, for installing zVM Region
   Server, at the top of the page it says "Configure OpenStack by
   following chapter 5 in the Enabling z/VM for OpenStack guide..."
   This is not correct, and this line needs to be deleted. The
   correct order of this is at the end of step #6, where it does
   show to 'What to do next ... Configure OpenStack by
   following..."
   
   2. We instruct the user to 'Configure Openstack by following
   chapter 5' of the pdf doc, but, that chap 5 is almost 40 pages
   and covers a full range of topics which probably are not
   relevant to the needs of our ICO z-region deployment. We need
   to articulate more specifically what are the exact items that
   needs to be reviewed and configured. That statement is too
   wide-open as a 'what to do next' step.
   
   3. In the 'Note' section of step 5, the customer doesn't
   understand how/where to do the 'Customizing a zVM Region Server
   Deployment'. The order of that topic makes it seem like you
   will complete the region server deployment and then next you
   will customize it. Really that is not the case- the customer
   should read and understand all of the available customizations
   before he creates the ds job.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description how to configure z-region server is not precise
   enough. In addition the link to the "OpenStack Configuration" of
   "Enabling z/VM for OpenStack
   (Support for OpenStack Icehouse Release)
   " pointing to the parent chapter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Improve documentation and fix link reference to "OpenStack
   Configuration".
