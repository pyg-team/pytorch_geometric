APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard web
   service integration (SOAP Connector), you might see the
   StackOverFLowError when processing a very long SOAP fault
   response:
   
   java.lang.StackOverflowError
   at
   java.io.ObjectOutputStream$BlockDataOutputStream.write(ObjectOut
   putStream.java:1880)
   ...
   at
   com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.connector.SOAPConnector.handleFault(SOAPCon
   nector.java:1265)
   ...
   
   You also might see an error indicating that the given SOAPAction
   <SOAPAction_Name> does not match an operation error. Web service
   integration generates the wrong SOAP action field with a double
   forward slash (//) and gives you this error if the following
   conditions occur:
   
   -The WSDL has a target namespace ending with a forward slash
   (/).
   -The WSDL doesn't contain a SOAPAction field or the SOAP action
   is empty.
   -You use an Authentication method instead of specifying "None".
   -You select "Use Basic Security".
