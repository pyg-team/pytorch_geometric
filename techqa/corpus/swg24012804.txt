 DOWNLOADABLE FILES

ABSTRACT
 A significantly reduced footprint JMS Client that allows a JMS application running in a J2SE environment to connect to an IBM WebSphere Application Server service integration bus. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The IBM Client for Java™ Message Service (JMS) on Java 2, Standard Edition (J2SE) with WebSphere Application Server is an embeddable technology that provides JMS V1.1 connections to a service integration bus messaging engine in WebSphere Application Server V6.0.2 (or above) or any IBM product that incorporates the service integration bus. The connection to the service integration bus messaging engine can be either TCP or SSL. HTTP connectivity is not supported. 

The functionality provided by the IBM Client for JMS on J2SE with IBM WebSphere Application Server is now superseded by the stand-alone thin clients supplied in the runtimes directory of a WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 installation. See the Migration to the Thin Client for JMS with WebSphere Application Server [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=compass&product=was-nd-mp&topic=rjj_jmsthcli_migrate602] topic of the WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 information center for further information.

You can install the client in any location.

The client supports the following Java Runtime Environments (JREs):

IBM JRE 1.4.2 and 1.5.0
Sun JRE 1.4.2 and 1.5.0

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
See the Getting Started guide to select the correct dowloadable file. 
The download installation file supports multiple install options. To perform an install of the client enter:



java –jar <installation file>.jar [flags] [arguments] 
Flags:  * -text install using a command-line interface 
 * -silent install using silent license acceptance 
 * -xpd install Lotus Expeditor v6.1 Device Runtime Environment J2SE 5.0 ready executables


Arguments:  1. The install option, one of jms, jms_jndi_ibm, jms_jndi_sun, nls (see below)
    
    
 2. The installation directory.


The following install options are available:  * jms - JMS only
   Choose this option if you require JMS v1.1 function only. All connection factories must be programmatically created, since no Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) function is available. This option has the smallest installed footprint.
   
   
 * jms_jndi_ibm - JMS + JNDI for IBM JREs
   Choose this option if you require JMS v1.1 with basic JNDI function to run under an IBM JRE.
   
   
 * jms_jndi_sun - JMS + JNDI for Sun JREs
   Choose this option if you require JMS v1.1 with basic JNDI function to run under a Sun JRE.
   
   
 * nls - optional National Language Support (NLS) files
   Choose this option if you require support for languages other than English.


For example, to install JMS + JNDI for IBM JREs into c:\jms use: 

java –jar sibc_install-<build>.jar jms_jndi_ibm c:\jms
