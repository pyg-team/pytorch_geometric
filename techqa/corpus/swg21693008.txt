Title: IBM Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects TPM for OS Deployment and TPM for Images (CVE-2014-8730) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) padding vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack affects the GSKit component that can be optionally utilized by Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating System Deployment (TPM for OSD) and Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images (TPM for Images). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730] 


DESCRIPTION: 

Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)-like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections. 


CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images 7.1.x
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment 7.1.x 
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images (and System X Edition) 7.1.x 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Customers using IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment 7.1.1x or IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images 7.1.1.x should apply the IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS/Images Fix Pack 18 (7.1.1.18) or later. 

Customers using GSKit should use or upgrade to GSKit version 8.0.14.48 or higher. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all versions of Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment and Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images that use the GSKit component, IBM recommends enabling strict CBC padding enforcement. 

To enable strict CBC padding enforcement set the environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE at a system wide level to ensure that channels using the TLS protocol adhere to strict compliance of the TLS RFC.

NOTE: Enabling strict CBC padding enforcement in Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment and Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images installations requires GSKit version 8.0.14.25 or later.

You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues.
