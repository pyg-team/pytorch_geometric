PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the Tivoli Storage Manager installation guides, in the
   section "Formatting the database and log," the text was
   changed as follows:
   
   "<AIX, HP-UX, Linux> Tip: If DB2 does not start after you
   issue the DSMSERV FORMAT command, you might need to disable
   the  file system mount option NOSUID. If this option is set on
   the file system that contains the DB2 instance owner
   directory, or  on any file system that contains the DB2
   database, active logs, archive logs, failover logs, or
   mirrored logs, the option  must be disabled to start the
   system.
   
   After you disable the NOSUID option, remount the file system
   and then start DB2 by issuing the following command:
   db2start
   
   <Solaris> Tip: If DB2 does not start after you issue the
   DSMSERV FORMAT command, you might need to disable the file
   system mount option NOSETUID. If this option is set on the
   file system that contains the DB2 instance owner directory, or
   on any  file system that contains the DB2 database, active
   logs, archive logs, failover logs, or mirrored logs, the
   option must be  disabled to start the system.
   
   After you disable the NOSETUID option, remount the file system
   and then start DB2 by issuing the following command:
   db2start"
   
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Linux.
