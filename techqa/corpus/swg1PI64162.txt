APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WAS plugin properties of a web server cannot be correctly
   discovered and applied by the UrbanCode Configuration plugin.
   
   Step to reproduce:
   1. Create a web server in the websphere via the admin console
   go to Servers --> New server
   server type: Web server
   Select node: <any node>
   Server name: webtest
   Type: IBM HTTP Server
   Select a Web server template: IHS
   Port: 9092
   Web server installation location: /opt/IBM/HTTP
   Plug-in installation location: /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/Plugins
   Application mapping to the Web server: All
   
   2. Check the plugin properties of the new created web server via
   admin
   console:
   go to Servers --> All servers --> webtest --> Plug-in properties
   and we
   can see following values:
   Refresh configuration interval: 60
   Plug-in configuration file name: plugin-cfg.xml
   Plug-in key store file name: plugin-key.kdb
   Web server copy of Web server plug-in files:
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/Plugins/config/webtest/plugin-cfg.xml
   Plug-in key store directory and file name:
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/Plugins/config/webtest/plugin-key.kdb
   Log file name:
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/Plugins/logs/webtest/http_plugin.log
   
   3. Use WAS Configuration discovery step 'WebSphere Configuration
   Discovery' to export all the config of this websphere instance
   and save
   in all.json
   
   4. In the all.json, note that you cannot find any plugin
   properties
   as shown in step 2, which are plugin-cfg.xml,
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/Plugins/logs/webtest/http_plugin.log etc.
   
   5. Use the WAS Configuration apply step 'WebSphere Configuration
   Apply'  to apply above exported all.json to this websphere
   instance
   
   6. Check the plugin properties of the web server via admin
   console:
   Go to Servers --> All servers --> webtest --> Plug-in properties
   and we
   can see following values:
   Refresh configuration interval: <no value>
   Plug-in configuration file name: <no value>
   Plug-in key store file name: <no value>
   Web server copy of Web server plug-in files: <no value>
   Plug-in key store directory and file name: <no value>
   Log file name: <no value>
   
   All properties value are removed after all.json are applied.
   These
   properties value should be kept unchanged since we apply the
   same json
   file just exported
