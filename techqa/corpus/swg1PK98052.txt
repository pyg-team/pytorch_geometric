APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR adds a new configuration for the portal 'WP
   PumaStoreService' to disable access control enforcement for
   read operations. This will improve performance for search
   operations, but at the same time grant read access to users and
   user groups for all authenticated and anonymous users in the
   system.
   
   New Setting:
   
   'WP PumaStoreService':
   Property: store.puma_default.disableACforRead
   Value: true/false (default = false)
   
   Setting this property to true grants authenticated users and
   the anonymous user access to view all users, user groups and
   their attributes. All read operations against PUMA APIs on users
   and user groups are not access control enforced any more.
   
   To change or add the settings, use the WAS administrative
   console under. Select Resource Environment Providers -> 'WP
   PumaStoreService' -> Custom Properties.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PK97348 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK97348] and PK98052 introduce a new PumaStoreService setting
   'store.puma_default.disableACforRead' to disable access control
   enforcement for read operations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds a new configuration for the portal 'WP
   PumaStoreService' to disable access control enforcement for read
   operations. This will improve performance for search operations,
   but at the same time grant read access to users and user groups
   for all authenticated and anonymous users in the system.
   
         store.puma_default.disableACforRead = [true | false]
   (default = false)
   
   Setting this property to true grants authenticated users and
   the anonymous user access to view all users, user groups and
   their attributes. All read operations against PUMA APIs on users
   and user groups are not access control enforced any more.
   
   To change or add the settings, use the WAS administrative
   console under. Select Resource Environment Providers -> 'WP
   PumaStoreService' -> Custom Properties.
