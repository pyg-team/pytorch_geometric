END OF SYMPTOM DUMP 

CAUSE
It was determined that this was due to a bad Envelope control string, one that appears to have been compiled for the wrong platform or from an outdated release. Basically the control string has fields that are relied on to determine the type and format of the control string. The abends occur when a binary length field is byte swapped and causes storage overlays. 

 
In WebSphereÂ® Data Interchange v3.3, we modified the control strings that are generated by 3.3 to allow the product to identify the platform correctness before we used the control string. We also needed to be able to handle prior version control strings to prevent a migration requirement that all control strings be recompiled. 

For more information please refer to the EDIJEXPD or EDIJEXVD jcl under EDI.V3R3M0.SEDIINS1 where it states in Step004 to 3.1 Users the following:

NOTICE TO 3.1 CUSTOMERS: 
- YOU SHOULD COMMENT OUT THE WDI 3.2 EDIEISTD DSN ALLOCATION 
FOR EDI.PRE33.EISTD AND USE THE WDI 3.1 ALLOCATION 
- DO NOT REMOVE/COMMENT OUT ENVELOPE STANDARDS: E, I, T, U, 
OR X (WDI 3.3 REQUIRES THAT NEW ENVELOPE STANDARDS BE USED).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Users will need to recompile the Envelope Standard being used.
