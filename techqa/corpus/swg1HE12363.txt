APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Current documentation says the following for "Interview Plan
   States":
   Not Stated -- This covers all states from plan creation until
   one of the interviewees submits a response.
   In Progress -- At least one interview has submitted a response.
   Completed -- The Plan has been explicitly marked as completed.
   
   This needs to be corrected as follows:
   
   Not Started -- When the plan is created, until at least one
   person submits the response.
   In Progress -- When there is at least one response, but not
   everyone has replied to the last issuance. The last issuance is
   the original notice, if the repeated interviews were not turned
   on, or the last repeated interview as determined by the End By
   date.
   Completed -- When either all of the targets have complete status
   for the last issuance or the plan was manually completed at
   which point all of the targets statuses are set to complete as
   well.
