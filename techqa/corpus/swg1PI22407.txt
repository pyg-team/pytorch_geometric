APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running WTX Java base adapter (JBAPI or JALE) under IBM
   Integration Bus (IIB), a large number class load errors are
   logged by Message Broker.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00045222
   EM / EM
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender user of the WTX Java-based
   adapters (such as JBAPI and JALE) inside of a IBM Integration
   Bus environment
   
   Problem Description:
   The WTX JNI layer causes unexpected BAPI adapter class loading
   error messages to get reported in the Broker log files.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When running under IIB, any WTX Java-based JBAPI or JALE
   invocations prevent unnecessary class load errors from getting
   logged by Broker.  Before this fix, a large number of class load
    failure messages would get logged.
