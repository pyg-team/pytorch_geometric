 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerablities have been discovered in OpenSSL 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2014-3570
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on
some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2014-3571
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference
when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker
could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99703] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID:CVE-2014-3572
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a
handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2014-8275
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the
modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass
security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99709] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2015-0204
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts the use of
an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2015-0205
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions,
caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99708] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2015-0206
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the
dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a
remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99704] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
