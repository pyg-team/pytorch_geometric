 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 
Multiple vulnerabilities in Open Source Apache Tomcat reported by The Apache Software Foundation affect IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager


VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5664 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126962]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper handling of specific HTTP request methods for static error pages by the Default Servlet error page mechanism. By sending a specially crafted GET request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass HTTP method restrictions and cause the deletion or replacement of the target error page.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-7674 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin by the CORS Filter. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct client and server side cache poisoning.
