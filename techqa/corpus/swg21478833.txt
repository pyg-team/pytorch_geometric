Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is there a version of the SPSS to Quantum script (spsstoqt.sbs) available for the latest version of SPSS? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The only version available has only be tested with v13, v14 and v15. You can try it with later versions to see if it works but there are no guarantees it will. There are no plans to update this script for future versions of SPSS.

If you are going to be doing exports from SPSS to Quantum on a regular basis you may want to get in contact with your SPSS account manager to discuss purchasing the SPSS mrStudio which provides this functionality and is supported
