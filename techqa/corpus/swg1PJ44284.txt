APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the user role is configured with more than 2 in-baskets the
   Get Next button does not work when the In-basket is first
   loaded.  This issue occurs when the "hide work item in role
   in-baskets" is also set via the Work Page In-basket widget and
   the My Work in-basket is not the first tab for the role.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Created 2 Roles in Case Builder (i.e. Role1, Role2)
   2. In the Work page, In-basket toolbar widget, add a 'Get Next'
   button, with the 'Get next work item' action
   3. In the Work page, In-basket Widget, select 'hide work item in
   role in-baskets'
   4. Using Process Designer add the Role2 In-basket to Role1.
   Arrange the In-baskets so that the My Work In-basket appears
   last
   5. Log on icm with user belongs to Role1.
   6. In the Work page, when it first loaded, click on 'Get Next'
   button.
   
   Expected Results: The next work item is opened via the Work
   Detail page, or a popup message indicating there is no work
   
   Actual Results: Nothing happens when you click Get Next.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are several workarounds available for this issue:
   1. Switching to different In-basket and then switch back, the
   Get Next button will then work.
   2. Change the in-basket order to have 'My Work' in-basket as the
   first tab
   3. Do not set 'hide work item in Role in-basket'
