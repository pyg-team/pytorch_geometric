ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   In IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC), when user tries to scroll
   down a long list of item and iterations in a plan using the web
   client, the Focus keeps resetting to the top of the screen and
   mixes the links between uploaded files and other work items.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Setup:
   1. In an Out of the Box (OTB) Scrum process template, create a
   Release Backlog plan with some Epic WIs, and create some Stories
   and task WIs under each Epic.
   2. Disable the "Expand All" option in the plan.
   2. Expand manually in each categories.
   3. Start scrolling to any side (up or down) that has items
   without the "Progress" loaded.
   
   Observed behavior:
   The load notification states that it is loading, "Progress"
   loads, once the group has loaded, the viewport resets to the
   next item after the last item selected.
   
   Expected behavior:
   The load notification should state it is loading and the
   "Progress" should be loaded on first view and maintain the
   current viewport.
   
   Affected browsers:
   1. Mozilla Firefox.
   2. Microsoft Internet Explorer.
   
   Possible workarounds:
   1. Deselect the item, by clicking outside the area of items,
   like attachment 26063.
   2. Use Google Chrome (or Chromium).
