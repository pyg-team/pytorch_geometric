QUESTION
 Request-type data missing both on TEP (Request Analysis, JMS Summary, Datasources) and on MS for applications using Spring Framework bean requests. Why? 

CAUSE
Monitoring Spring Framework bean requests is not supported in version 7.2 GA (unpatched)

ANSWER
7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS-IF0002 (ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications V7.2 Interim-Fix 2) has introduced the feature for Spring Framework beans monitoring. 

This feature reports Spring Framework bean requests as EJB requests in TEMA Request Analysis workspace and MS workspaces.
