Title: IBM Sentinel WLM Administrator shows no information for my subnet server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I ihave SPSS 16.0..x and have nstalled the Sentinel License Manager for the network installation of SPSS on my machine. I ran the SPSSACTIVATOR command file. When I look at the WLM Administrator, I don't see any information, and there is no plus sign next to my server icon in the Subnet Servers tree. Why is this occurring? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please provide your authorization code to SPSS Technical Support. This behavior can occur if you use a single-user or site license authorization code instead of a network license code.

If this is the case, then once you receive the network version authorization code, you will have to go back to the C:\program files\common files\safenet sentinel\sentinel RMS license manager\WinNT folder and either delete or rename the LSERVRC file. Run the SPSSACTIVATOR file with the new authorization code, and when that is done, you can reopen the WLM Administrator and you should see the correct information linked to your subnet server
