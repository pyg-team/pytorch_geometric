QUESTION
Where can you find information about the base version of WebSphere Application Server for a Sametime 8.5 release, what other versions can be used, and any fixes required?

ANSWER
Sametime 8.5 ships with and requires a base version of WebSphere Application Server, which is specified in the Sametime System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007792]. Updating your server(s) to a later WebSphere Application Sever fix pack might require additional interim fixes (iFixes), which is indicated in a technote (release note) posted to the IBM Support Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Lotus/IBM_Sametime]. Both the SDK and the fix pack should be applied. 

The information from the System Requirements and technotes is summarized in the table below.
