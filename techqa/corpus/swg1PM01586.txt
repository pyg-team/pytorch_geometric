   Clients received MQ reason code 2009 and message channels
   reported error message CSQX620E with return code 432.

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   System SSL APAR OA31172 changes the secure socket library
   implementation in a manner that can impair WebSphere MQ
   interoperability when secret key reset is used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds code to MQ which will ask the secure socket
   library for secret key reset interoperability to be maintained.
   This will allow MQ to continue to function as designed when
   running against the latest socket library code and will prevent
   disruption to MQ SSL/TLS connectivity when secret key reset is
   enabled.
