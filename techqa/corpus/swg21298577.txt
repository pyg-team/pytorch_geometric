SYMPTOM
While installing Base Services, after the "Integration Adapter JMS Configuration" panel I get this error:

CTGIN2275E: WebSphere thin admin client install verification completed with errors.; WASX7246E: Cannot establish "SOAP" connection to host "scvm2.tivlab.raleigh.ibm.com" because of an authentication failure. Ensure that user and password are correct on the command line or in a properties file.
Exception message (if any): "ADMN0022E: Access is denied for the getProcessType operation on Server MBean because of insufficient or empty credentials."
WASX7213I: This scripting client is not connected to a server process; please refer to the log file C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\wasclient\logs\wsadmin.traceout for additional information.
WASX8011W: AdminTask object is not available.
WASX7029I: For help, enter: "$Help help"
wsadmin>; 


CAUSE
Not all necessary middleware services are up and running.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Not all necessary middleware services are up and running. For example, on a stand-alone Windows 2003 Maximo server, this error is commonly seen for not having started these services: 

 
DB2 - DB2COPY1 - IDSCCMDB

and

IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance V6.1 - idsccmdb


Open the Services panel and start these services. 

It is also advisable to make these services start automatically. This also can be done in the Services panel by right clicking and choosing Properties. Then for the "Startup type" select "Automatic".

As an additional note, there is another situation that can lead to this error. It could be a pure SOAP connection issue. It may be that the admin server's system clock is out of date. When the WAS client created on the Admin Server tries to connect to the WAS server, its SSL certification was out of date and thus failed the SOAP connection. Doublecheck the Admin Workstation's date and time and it if necessary.

As with any technote, this technote lists some of the possible reason for this error. There are others as well.
