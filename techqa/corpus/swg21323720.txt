Title: IBM Rational Rhapsody warning: Link will not be instantiated - ill-formed link across composite boundaries - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am getting the following warning message for links between objects in my model in IBM Rational Rhapsody: Warning: Link will not be instantiated - ill-formed link across composite boundaries
Why am I getting this message and what does it mean? 

SYMPTOM
Warning message: Link will not be instantiated - ill-formed link across composite boundaries

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In a composite relationship, the whole is responsible for the creation of its parts and the initialization of the links between the parts. However, if the parts exits across composite boundaries (if the parts are owned by different classes) -- then who is responsible for the initialization? There are many different possibilities. 

For this reason, Rational Rhapsody issues this warning and the code generator will not generate the link. It needs to be added programmatically. The initialization code could be added to the owning package or one of the composites.
