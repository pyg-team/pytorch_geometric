SUMMARY
 Potential Security Exposure with IBM WebSphere MQ Telemetry 7.0.1


There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition Version 5, that is used by IBM WebSphere MQ Telemetry 7.0.1. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates between July 2014 and January 2015. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-4263 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4263]
DESCRIPTION: The JSSE component's Diffie-Hellman key exchange implementation is vulnerable to a man-in-the middle attack. The fix adds a new check to prevent the attack. 
This issue affects any application that uses the JSSE implementation of Diffie-Helman key exchange, either directly or via protocols such as SSL or TLS. The vulnerability applies to both client and server usage.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94606 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94606] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2014-4244 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4244]
DESCRIPTION: If an attacker can observe local variables (temperature, RF, sound), they can deduce the RSA private key based on changes in those variables. The fix introduces "dead" computations (aka blinding) to foil these attacks.This issue affects applications which use the RSA encryption algorithm, but it is only exploitable by a local user with direct access to the environment on which the JRE is running.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94605 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94605] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)


CVEID: CVE-2015-0410 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0410]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)


CVEID: CVE-2014-6593 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6593]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100153] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
