APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: An alternate hash algorithm for java.lang.String
   is introduced to avoid the hash collision in put/get operations
   of Hash related collection maps like Hashtable, HashMap, etc
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The current hashing algorithm is more predictable and can cause
   hash collision in put/get operations of Hash related collection
   maps like Hashtable, HashMap, etc. The alternate hash
   implementation will avoid the hash collision by introducing a
   random factor.
   Due to the introduction of random factor, the order of retrieval
   of elements from the collection maps can differ when the new
   hash algorithm is used. As documented in the API specification,
   there is no guarantee as to the order of the map; in particular,
   it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over
   time. Application should make sure that they removed any such
   dependency before enabling the alternate hash algorithm.
   By default, the new hashing algorithm is disabled. It will be in
   affect only when the map capacity reaches the hashing threshold
   which can be set using Java command line argument
   -Djdk.map.althashing.threshold=n.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR14
   .
   The JDK has been equipped with an alternate hash implementation
   which avoids the hash collision in put/get operations of Hash
   related collection maps
