ABSTRACT
 Lost sources have a negative impact on scan coverage. AppScan Source does not directly classify lost sources in the same way as it does with lost sinks. Welooked at how to discover lost sources by using informational findings as well as the sometimes cryptic "Scan Coverage Findings." Understanding and resolving lost sources will offer a big return, in that it dramatically improves the quality of findings and the scan coverage. 

CONTENT
Members of the Application Security Support and Development teams shared information on lost sources. The presentation by lead SAST researcher Stephen Teilhet included: 

1. What are lost sources and how to identify them 
2. How to define lost sources to improve scan coverage 

After the presentation, we opened the phone line to take questions from the audience. Throughout the event, attendees asked questions in the IBM SmartCloud Meeting Web chat. It was an interesting and educational session.
