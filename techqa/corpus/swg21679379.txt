Title: IBM Removing Deployment Engine (DE 1.4.x.x) manually - United States

Text:
DEL2; DEL2INST; Deployment Engine; remove TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The preferred method of removing DE is to run "si_inst.sh/bat â€“r" but at times it is needed to manually remove DE, if this uninstall script fails or not works as expected. 

SYMPTOM
Using the si_inst.sh/bat script does not work in completely removing DE from the server


ENVIRONMENT
Deployment Engine DE 1.4

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please note: "Removing DE is a destructive process. If other products are using Deployment Engine, this will delete data for those products as well, which will prevent those products from being able to apply maintenance releases. If you have multiple products using DE, and you need to reinstall DE, please contact IBM support to get advice how to best proceed. 

 It is recommended that you take a backup of DE by running the de_backupdb before uninstalling /removing DE.
