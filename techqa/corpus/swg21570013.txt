 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have a char column in a CFF stage that contains COBOL low values, I try to convert these to a space using the convert function in a transformer, but this does not appear to work, the column does not change.. 

CAUSE
If in a transformer function you use a literal char(0) to convert the low value in the convert function, such as convert(char(0), ' ', DSLink.charcol), The char(0) will be typed as a varchar. A varchar column with just a char(0) will be seen as an empty string and not a char(0).

ANSWER
Set up a Stage variable called say, charzero, type this as a char(1) with initial value char(0). Use this stage variable in the convert function. Example: convert(charzero, ' ', DSLink.charcol)
