Title: IBM Viewing the IBM® DB2® Content Manager Enterprise Version 8.3 Information Center in ports other than 8081 - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I attempt to view the DB2 Content Manager Enterprise Version 8.3 Information Center or system administration client help in either http://localhost:8081 or http://hostname:8081, the page cannot be found. However, I can view the information center in http://localhost:8082 or http://hostname:8082. 

CAUSE
If the 8081 port is already occupied, then the information center sets the default to the next open port (as in, 8082, 8083, 8084). For the base version of the Version 8.3 system administration client on Windows®, AIX®, and Solaris, the Help button always attempts to launch the information center in port 8081--fix pack 1 corrects the Help button behavior to launch the information center in the correct port whenever it differs from 8081.

ANSWER
To determine which port to that the information center automatically started in, view the IBMCMROOT/infoctr/cmcfgic.ini file. If the line reads: PORT=8082, then you would view the information center in http://localhost:8082 or http://hostname:8082. Windows only: You can click Start --> Programs --> IBM DB2 Content Manager Enterprise Edition --> Information center --> View Web service version to automatically launch the information center in the correct port number. 

UNIX® only: Contrary to what the information center readme states, you can restart the information center in a different port by completing the following steps: 

 1. Enter /etc/rc.cmcfgic -a stop. 
 2. Edit the PORT variable in $IBMCMROOT/infoctr/cmcfgic.ini to another open port that you prefer. 
 3. Enter /bin/nohup /etc/rc.cmcfgic -a start to restart the information center in that port number. If you do not have the nohup command, just enter /etc/rc.cmcfgic -a start.


Windows only: You cannot restart the information center in a different port. The port number is hard-coded into the registry (and editing the registry is not recommended). Therefore, modifying %IBMCMROOT%/infoctr/cmcfgic.ini will have no effect.
