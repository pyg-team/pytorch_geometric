ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AST 8.7: False positive: Cacheable SSL Page Found
   
   The 'Cache-Control-no-store' needs to be added to the
   validation.
   
   AppScan Standard reports issue 'Cacheable SSL Page Found' on a
   page where the response contains header 'Cache-Control:
   no-cache, no-store'.
   
   The fix recommendation explains that 'Pragma: no-cache' should
   be also included, but 'Cache-Control-no-store' needs to be added
   to the validation.
   
   There are doubts about the appropriateness of including the
   Pragma directive, considering that RFC 2616 in section 14.32
   states:
   
   '...the meaning of 'Pragma: no-cache as a response header field
   is not actually specified...'
   
   More specifically, 'Pragma: no-cache' is defined as a request
   header, not as a response header. As a result, it is believed
   that AppScan Standard is finding is a false positive due to
   incorrect interpretation of the RFC.
