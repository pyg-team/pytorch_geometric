Gathering situation specific information For specific instructions related to problem(s) with the installation of the toolkit, the execution of commands from the CLI, the use of the Micro Gateway or DataPower Gateway, click on one of the specific sections below to get a listing of the documentation that the support team requires to diagnose your problem.

API CONNECT TOOLKIT - INSTALLATION TROUBLESHOOTING 
For every installation problem of the API Connect Developer Toolkit, please send us:


 *  the npm log file called npm-debug.log. The npm-debug.log is usually in the folder where the install command was initiated (it can also be in the user profile home directory or the system tmp directory).
   (Tip: if no npm-debug.log can be found, append the following " > toolkit-install.txt 2>&1 " to the end of the command). the exact npm command used to install the toolkit. the type of user (admin, non admin, etc...) that was running the installation command. 
 *  
   
   
   

API CONNECT TOOLKIT - COMMAND LINE TROUBLESHOOTING
For every issue while using the API Connect Toolkit command line interface (CLI) tell us:

 * What is the action/purpose you are trying to achieve with the command line? 
 * What command(s) have you run? 
 * What is the current log-level set for your toolkit?  * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * If the current log-level is not set to debug, please set it to debug.  * 
    * debug
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Once the log-level is set to debug, try running the command again. 
   Share the apic.log from the following location: 
   /Users/<username>/.apiconnect 

Verify the command line usage in section Getting started with the developer toolkit command-line tool [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMNED_5.0.0/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/capim-toolkit-cli-getting-started.html] of the product documentation.




 

API CONNECT TOOLKIT - TESTING WITH MICROGATEWAY TROUBLESHOOTING 
For every problem related to the usage of the MicroGateway, follow the steps outlined in the document:

API CONNECT TOOLKIT - TESTING WITH DATAPOWER GATEWAY TROUBLESHOOTING
For every issue while using the API Connect Toolkit with IBM DataPower Gateway provide us with the version of the following:

 * 
 * Docker 
 * Docker Compose 
 * Docker for Linux®, MacOs or Windows®

Verify that these versions meet the requirements outlined in section API Connect Toolkit - Testing with DataPower Gateway [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMNED_5.0.0/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/tapim_apic_test_with_dpdockergateway.html] of the product documentation, especially the Docker settings (the share of the C: drive is enabled, the Proxies information is correctly matching your company requirements and at least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPUs were allocated).
