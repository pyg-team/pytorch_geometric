   TEXT SHOULD READ:
   After configuring and using the standalone LDAP user registry,
   you may find that your LDAP user registry is not working exactly
   as you would like. You can easily update the LDAP user registry
   and make the necessary changes. For example, you can change your
   LDAP Bind password. However, note that such a task will remove
   any attribute mappings that you have added since you previously
   enabled/updated the standalone LDAP user registry. Thus, you
   will need to re-run the mapping steps as described on the <OS>:
   Mapping attributes section.
