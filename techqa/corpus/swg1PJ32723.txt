ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   Description of Problem (full details)
   Customer previously were using HTML eForms Print Service with
   eForms for Open Client (OCeF). The HTML eForms Print Service
   allows them to convert the form data into compressed TIFF
   files. Valid compression schemes were LZW, none, CCITT3 and
   CCITT4, with LZW being the default.
   Customer is now doing a pilot with P8 4.0 in five of their
   branches.
   When they use the Render Form command in Application Engine UI
   Service (AEUIS) they noticed that the resulting TIFF is
   uncompressed and average file size is over 1MB, significantly
   larger when compared to the TIFF files produced by HTML eForms
   Print Service.
   <<.../ecm_help/developer_help/workplace/guide/aeuis_cmd_ref.htm
   #1410>>
   The Render Form command in AEUIS in turn is using the eForms
   Java API which support several other compression types, but
   not the LZW, CCITT3, and CCITT4.
   <<.../ecm_help/developer_help/eforms_java_api/javadocs/com/file
   net/eforms/api/TiffCompressionType.html
   Customer expect that when they migrated from OCeF to P8eF,
   they will be able to continue to convert their form data files
   into compressed TIFF files using AEUIS Render Form command as
   they have done in the past using HTML eForms Print Service.
   As of now the uncompressed TIFF files produced by AEUIS is too
   large to be practical / usable.
   The inability to render form data into compressed TIFF files is
   a major road block for customer in continuing their P8 4.0
   Pilot.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since P8 4.0 install.
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   Yes.
   Is there a workaround? :
   No.
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   The inability to render form data into compressed TIFF files is
   a major road block for customer in continuing their P8 4.0
   Pilot.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   By L2 (CSS)
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Use AEUIS to render a form data file into TIFF.
   For Example:
   http://bcpp840:9080/Workplace/integrationWebBasedCommand?_comma
   ndId=1410&op=render&mimeType=application%2Fx-filenet-formdata&i [http://bcpp840:9080/Workplace/integrationWebBasedCommand?_commandId=1410&op=render&mimeType=application%2Fx-filenet-formdata&i]
   mage=tiff&timeZone=PST&objectStoreName=OS01&id={58FDDB9B-9FCC-4
   F5B-BD92-1092AAB58FBC}
   2. Check the TIFF header using free 3rd party tool such as
   AsTIFFTagViewer. Notice the Compression tag = uncompressed.
   Actual Results:
   TIFF file produced is uncompressed (large)
   Expected Results:
   TIFF file produced should be compressed (much smaller in size)
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s
   N
   What logs were collected and where are they located?
