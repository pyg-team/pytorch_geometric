Title: IBM Time Window Analyzer(TWA) setup question - United States

Text:
twa; tbsm; addmetricmeta TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When defining metrics to monitor using TWA there is a addMetricMeta API to define a metric to monitor.

Is there a corresponding removeMetricMeta ? 

ANSWER
Unfortunately, no. There is a disableMetricCollection API to disable collections of data for the added metric, but there is currently no mechanism to remove the definition of the data to be collected. 

If this is needed, please contact IBM support for the necessary SQL commands to remove the metric from your DB
