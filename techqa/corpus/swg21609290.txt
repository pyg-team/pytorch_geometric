QUESTION
 Are the kernel parameters required for the ITCAM for J2EE product on Solaris 10 or Solaris 11? 

ANSWER
The ITCAM for DC (J2EE or WebSphere) does any require any additional Solaris10 or Solaris 11 kernel parameters in addition to what has already been specified by the relevant application server (J2EE or WebSphere) documentation.
Hence, whatever is recommended for the application server (JBoss, WebLogic, Tomcat, etc..) is sufficient for the ITCAM DC also. ITCAM DC should not have a copy of its own as it does not 
have an special needs.
