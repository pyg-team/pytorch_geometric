PROBLEM
When installing Webform Server, the IBMWebformServerTranslator service tries to start but does not finish. The service times out after 5 minutes and then the install finishes. Trying to stop and start the translator service also fails.

SYMPTOM
During the install process, a debug window opens up and attempts to start the Translator service. At this point, the install hangs until the user receives a message saying that the install has timed out. The user should be able to select the finish button on the installer. 

IBM Support has also had reports of the Translator appearing to install and the service appears to be started in services.msc. But navigating to the WebformServer toolbar returns the error message "This page cannot be displayed."


CAUSE
This issue occurs if files of a previous API are found on the system path. For Windows, this is the System32 folder (C:\Windows\System32).


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use these steps to diagnose the problem: 

 1. Open the install log found at <Webform Server Install location>\IBM\Lotus Forms\Server\3.0\WebformServer. You will see an entry where starting the Translator Service timed out after 5 minutes. 
 2. For Windows, check c:\Windows\System32 for the API dll files found under C:\Program Files\IBM\Lotus Forms\Server\3.0\API\redist\msc32 . 
 3. For Unix Systems, check /usr/lib/ for the following 3 API files (libpe_java.so, libuwi_java.so, and libpe_cc.so) 
 4. If the Translator appears to have started in the services, runnetstat -a on the command line to determine if the port 8085 is listed and is listening. 
 5. Create a file called wpf.pel in the root of C:\ drive(for Windows) and in /etc/(for Unix) and access the translator again. The program then creates a java.log file on the C:\ drive for Windows and debug.log under the current working directory for Unix.
    
    You can review the java.log file, which shows that the core.ifx could not be loaded.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For Window, you must delete the following files and folder in the System32 folder: 

 * the PureEdge folder 
 * pe_cc.dll 
 * pe_com.dll 
 * pe_crt71.dll 
 * pe_crtp71.dll 
 * pe_java.dll 
 * unicows.dll 
 * uwi_java.dll 
 * IFS_COM_API.tlb


For Unix Systems, you must delete the following files and folder in the usr/lib/ 

 * the PureEdge folder 
 * libpe_cc.so 
 * libpe_java.so 
 * libuwi_java.so


Once these files have been removed, restart the Translator server. You should be able to access the Welcome Page and Servlet Sample (if deployed).
