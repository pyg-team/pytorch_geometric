APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reproducible on both DOORS 9.4 and DOORS 9.5
   Problem Description
   -------------------
   User 1 is opening a module in exclusive edit and is attempting
   to load a view which takes quite sometime to finish loading as
   it has couple of layout DXLs which pull link information from
   other modules. If any other user (User2) tries to open the same
   module in read-only mode at the same time when User1 is already
   waiting for the view to load and tries to open the view list
   from the dropdown, the view names will not be shown in the
   dropdown instead 'View list locked' message will be displayed.
   
   - User2 has to either re-open the module after User-1 finishes
   the view loading operation
   
   Support obervations
   -------------------
   - We were able to reproduce this behavior in house with our data
   and the steps to reproduce are given below.
   
   1. Login to DOORS as User1 and Restore the attached Project
   archive (attached)
   2. Open the module named - Test mod1 in exclusive edit.
   3. Now load the view named 'view_test'.
   4. Now launch another DOORS Session and login as User2 on the
   same DOORS server.
   5. From the User2 DOORS terminal open the module in question in
   Read-only mode and then try to load the viewlist from the
   dropdown.
   6. Receive 'View List locked' error

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR has been rejected.
   The behaviour observed is current defined functionality.  For
   complex views, that view has to be finished loading before the
   current view list can be displayed for other users.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  This APAR has been rejected.
