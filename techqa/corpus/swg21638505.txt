 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can a silent installation for IBM Cognos Series 7.5 FixPack be created 

CAUSE
FixPacks does not have the standard response.ats file within the Updater folder to run the silent installation

ANSWER
Steps to get ready for an unattended Installation of the FixPack:


1. Download 7.5 (or higher) FixPack and extract the files 

2. Open a command box 

3. Navigate to the Updater folder of the FixPack 

4. Under the folder ...\cognos\updater run the following command: issetup -ats response.ats
This will create a default response.ats file in the folder 

5. Open the new generated response.ats file with a Text Editor and modify the drive location to be where your Series 7.5 components are installed 

6. Make sure "FIX_PACK_1_VERC" is set to the value 1 

7. Change the line "I Agree=n" to "I Agree=y" to accept the license agreement. If this is not done the installation will not start 

8. Save the file 

9. From the command box run the command: issetup -s response.ats
