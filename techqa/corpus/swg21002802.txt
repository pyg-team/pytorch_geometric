QUESTION
 I am using dynamic TCP/IP. Why am I getting an AEZD abend after an error out of EKCTSECR? I try to call the security exit to check on the workstation ID in memory. Then I want to go to a new routine to add the missing workstation to the WKCF, but before I can, the journal receives the error. 

ANSWER
If the workstation in question does not exist in the memory table WKCF, AEZD is generated at EKCJRNL when TSECR tries to journal (JRNL) the error. This is caused by the EXECKEY specified in CICSÂ® for JRNL. It should be USER, but if for some reason the EXECKEY of the TCP/IP listener routine, CSKL, has been set to CICS, the error occurs. 

This problem is resolved in one of two ways: 

 * JRNL should be changed to a key of CICS from USER 
 * CSKL (the TCP/IP listener task) should be changed to USER 


We used the second option, although either should work. You can use the CEDA transaction or tool to verify the EXECKEY for these options. Higher transactions, such as the listener CSKL, should be defined as USER, not as an EXECKEY of CICS.
