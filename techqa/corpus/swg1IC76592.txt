APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While polling DataPower for dpStatusSystemUsageTableTable using
   an SNMP agent such as the ITCAM agent for DataPower, the
   appliance
   may become unresponsive for a period of time which may lead to
   an unexpected appliance restart. This issue might occur during
   an appliance boot up or while the appliance is under load.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following may be used to work around or reduce the
   occurrence of this issue:
   1. Instead of using SNMP, use a CLI script to obtain the
   required status. Or
   2. Increase the polling/refresh interval for this particular
   metric to a large value.
   If using ITCAM for SOA Platform - ITCAM agent for DataPower,
   then the refresh interval may be set to the max value of
   2147483647 seconds. The refresh interval can be set using the
   'CDP_SYSTEMUSAGETABLE_REFRESH_INTERVAL' variable. On Windows
   systems, the variable is defined in the agent
   KBNENV_instancename file. On UNIX and Linux systems, the
   variable can be set in the agent $CANDLEHOME/config/bn.ini file.
   The agent must be restarted for the new setting to take effect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This table is now cached by the device so that repeated gets of
   the OID within 5 seconds will use the cached value; this will
   reduce the load on the device and help minimize the occurence of
   a watchdog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix will be in 3.8.0.14, 3.8.1.14, 3.8.2.5, 4.0.1.2
