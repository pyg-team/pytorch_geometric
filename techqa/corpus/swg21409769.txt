QUESTION
 CORBA probe : Name Service connection fails, why? 

CAUSE
The EMS administrator has provided the wrong details.

ANSWER
 

COMMENT: Please check passport advantage for the latest probe package, as all supported CORBA probes are now using IBM CORBA rather than Visisbroker. Please upgrade to the latest probe package rather than attempt to troubleshoot any older Visibroker based package, where possible. The IBM CORBA framework software includes a dumpns tool. 

 

The most probable cause of a connection issue is that the name given in the probes property is incorrect. 

 

To obtain the correct nomenclature ask the CORBA EMS administrator or else for Visibroker installations use the dumpnameservice tool. 

In order to run the dumpnameservice tool successfully you need to have Visibroker installed and create the correct environment.
e.g. 

vi run_DumpNameService 


#! /bin/sh
export CLASSPATH VBROKER_ADM
CLASSPATH=${OMNIHOME}/probes/java/:${OMNIHOME}/probes/java/lm.jar:${OMNIHOME}/probes/java/vbjorb.jar:${OMNIHOME}/probes/java/vbsec.jar:${CLASSPATH}:.
VBROKER_ADM=${OMNIHOME}/probes/java/
java DumpNameService $*
:wq

chmod 755 run_DumpNameService

You can run the command as normal.
e.g.
./run_DumpNameService name-service-host name-service-port

where name-service-host and name-service-port are the host/port being used in the probes properties file.

Note: The tool uses the pre Visibroker8 jar files : vbjorb.jar and vbsec.jar

The output from the utility allows the Naming Service to be checked and the names used within the probes properties file to be confirmed.

e.g. The IOR string contains the information of the Host/Port/Name:-
Name: TMF_MTNM.Class/Cisco Systems.Vendor/Cisco Transport 

Manager.EMSInstance/7_0.Version/CTM.EMS/NotificationChannel 

Type: IDL:omg.org/CosNotifyChannelAdmin/EventChannel:1.0 

Host: 192.168.1.6 

Port: 9472 

IOR:00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
