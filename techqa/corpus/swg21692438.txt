QUESTION
 Can you change the IBM Rational Integration Tester Agent (RIT-Agent) licensing type after installation? 

CAUSE
You have installed RIT-Agent and selected one type of licensing.
You need to change the license type due to error or having a different licensing agreement with IBM.

For example, you have installed in Agent Mode and wish to switch to PVU Mode.


ANSWER
It is not possible to change the licensing type after installation. 

You need to uninstall and reinstall the product again and enter the new license type in IBM Installation Manager (IM).
