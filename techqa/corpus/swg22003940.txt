Title: IBM Error "No accessible DLL version of RRX" with IBM Datacap Rulerunner - United States

Text:
rulerunner datacap error TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to implement a new install of IBM Datacap Rulerunner. 

SYMPTOM
Batches abort and error is given in rulerunner log.


CAUSE
Incorrect path for RRS folder in the Windows registry

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look for the following error type in the rulerunner log:
no accessible DLL version of RRX
"c:\datacap\app\dco_app\rules\autodoc.dll"; errno:2 - No such file or directory; doserrno:2 - No such file
or directory

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Datacap\RRS\locations\rrs tells the Datacap Server and Rulerunner where to find the rrs\apps and rrs\rrx folders.

On a standalone installation, the registry key that Rulerunner uses to find the rrs directory is missing, so Rulerunner defaults to looking at c:\datacap\rrs. If this is not the installed location, then batches will abort. If the registry exists, you can look at said registry location and enter the correct path.

If the registry entry does not exist on the Rulerunner machine, then do the following to update the registry on the Rulerunner server:
1) Run regedit on the Datacap Server.
2) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432Node\Datacap\RRS and export the RRS node.
3) Copy the .reg file to the Rulerunner server and import it.
4) Run regedit and navigate to HKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Datacap\RRS\location and check or modify the RRS entry with the proper path to the Datacap\RRS directory.
