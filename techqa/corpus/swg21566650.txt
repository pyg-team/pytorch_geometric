Title: IBM EventReader Delete Policy not being run - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Policy designated to run upon the deletion of an event in the ObjectServer is not being run



CAUSE
The EventReader contains Filters using the "like" operator.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Where an EventReader is configured to run a Delete Policy and has Filters that contain the "like" operator there is an extra property required to enable the EventReader to use said Filters and capture IDUC output from the ObjectServer.


In the file:

$NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_[EventReaderName].props

and the property:

impact.[EventReaderName].uselikeoperator=true

This requires an ImpactServer restart (ewas.sh stop/start) to enable.

Further details and related information on this property are contained in the TechNote and APAR links below.
