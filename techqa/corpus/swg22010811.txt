Title: IBM File Agent request to startup FA service with specific user ID - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When wanting to use a specific id to start File Agent and scan the watch folder. 

SYMPTOM
File Agent API user permission in environment.


CAUSE
File/Folder permissions on ID's being used.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review logs and error message. Review OS permission on ID's being used to watch folder

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The API user "A" and service account "B" are separate things with 
different requirements. Of course, is it possible - and often the case -
to use one account for both. Though the different requirements may 
provide a reason for some not to do so. 

The API user and local id can be the same and they do have to have 
permissions to the watch folder. 

The ID's however do not have to be the same but have to have the correct
permissions in place to work.

You need to set the CDFA service to run under a custom CDFA service 
account. This is required as the the default local system account cannot
access remote servers or network shares. 
The minimum requirements for this CDFA service account are: 
- Log on as a service 
- Full access to the CDFA installation folder. 
- Read & List Folder Contents permission on the network share and all 
folders along the path. In addition, Modify permission is required when 
you optionally enable the rename logic (-Duserenamelogic=true).
