TSM TDPEXC TDP4VE replica cluster high availability missing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When protecting Exchange 2010 Servers with Data Protection for VMware in-guest application protection, only active Exchange databases are available for database-level recovery. 

SYMPTOM
Even when all requirements are met and the Exchange Server virtual guests are correctly protected by Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments - Data Protection for VMware, only active databases are listed in the MMC GUI of Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Exchange.


CAUSE
Exchange 2010 uses separate VSS writers to snapshot active and passive database copies. 

If the Exchange 2010 VSS writer for replicas is disabled, no application aware backup of these databases can be performed. 


ENVIRONMENT
Exchange 2010 DAG environments. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Verify the Exchange server virtual machine is protected at database-level: 

 * 
 * 
 * dsmc query vm VMname-of-Exchange-Server -detail -asnode=datacenter_node 
 * The output should contain the following line:
   Application(s) protected: MS Exchange 2010 (database-level recovery)


2. Check on the Exchange Server if the following registry key is set to 0: 

 * 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this case the Exchange Replica Writer needs to be enabled by removing the EnableVSSwriter key and recycling of the Exchange Replication service.
