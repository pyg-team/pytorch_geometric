LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TXSeries supports Microsoft SQL as an XA resource manager on
   Windows. But Micro Focus COBOL samples and switchload file to
   support MSSQL as XA resource manager are not supplied along with
   TXSeries 7.1. Hence you may not able to build the MF COBOL
   switchload file and sample applications for MSSQL Server.
   This APAR will include the necessary switchload files and
   samples of MF COBOL to support MS SQL as XA resource manager.
   This APAR will be available from TXSeries 7.1 fix pack 3
   onwards.
   
   Reference : defect 211712.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The necessary files will be supplied with TXSeries 7.1 fix pack
   3 onwards.
