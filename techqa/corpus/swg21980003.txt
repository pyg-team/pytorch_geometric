QUESTION
 You are having a problem with user management with IBM Decision Center. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Operation Decision Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

ANSWER



TROUBLESHOOTING

If you are using the business console user service sample [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.7.1/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.samples/topics/smp_bc_userlist_integ_det.html?lang=en] with release before 8.8, and you are having connectivity issue or no user shows up in the business console while assigning the user to the change activity, you can try running the sample driver below to isolate the configuration issue. Please backup the original UserDirectoryServiceLDAP.java from the sample folder before replacing it. You will also need to modify the connection value and also its search string. 

If you are able to get the user result when using the search string of "user@mycompany.com", you will see a message " User is user@mycompany.com is added.". Otherwise, you will get a message, "No users found with search String: user@mycompany.com". 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980003&aid=2]UserDirectoryServiceLDAP.java [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980003&aid=1] 

Adapt the parameters with this tool until you are able to add a user to the list. Then replicate this configuration in Decision Center. 

COLLECTING DATA


If you are unable to complete the configuration please collect the following information. 
 1. Decision Center version
    In the console, click "About" on the top-right of any page. 
 2. What is the application server and its fixpack level? 
 3. What is the LDAP version and its fixpack level? 
 4. The detail steps you use to configure the user management in ODM. If you can provide a screens shot of the configuration setting. 
 5. Decision Center logs. 
    These can be found in the logs folder of the Application Server that the decision center is deployed on. If working with WebSphere Application Server, make sure you also retrieve the log files in the logs\ffdc folder.


Once you have collected this information, you can simply submit the diagnostic data to IBM support.
