Title: IBM Content Navigator (ICN) entry templates are not working for non-admin users despite them having required permission on the document - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Non-admin users opening entry templates created in ICN are only shown the property view of the entry template object instead of the entry template being opened for use, despite the users having the required permissions on the entry template object. This is due to lack of permissions at the object store level. 

SYMPTOM
An admin user creates a new entry template via ICN's entry template manager view and grants non-admin users the appropriate level of permission ("VIEW_CONTENT") on the entry template in order to use it. However, the non-admin users can still not use the entry template, as the "Open" action is greyed out and double-clicking the object only displays the object properties.


CAUSE
When attempting to open an entry template, a check is performed on whether users can generally add items to a repository at the object store level. If permission is missing at that level, the entry template cannot be used even if the user has the required permission on that object.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3.x
FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2.1.x

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Object store permissions need to be set to "Use object store" or higher for a user to be able to use entry templates on that object store.
