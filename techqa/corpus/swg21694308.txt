Text:
TDWC; blank; missing; menu; empty; view; UNAUTHENTICATED TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the page is blank after logging into Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) v9.x's DASH, but the associated WebSphere Administration Console is accessible, then there may be a global security configuration issue. 

SYMPTOM
TDWC v9.x / DASH page is completely blank after login.


CAUSE
Global security configuration problem.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Change the trace level for the JazzSM WebSphere profile to mode wssec_all:


a. Login to the system with the JazzSM instance: root on UNIX, administrator user on Windows 

b. cd <TWAUI_Home>/wastools 

c. changeTraceProperties.sh -user <JazzSM admin user> -password <passWord> -mode wssec_all 

d. Perform login to JazzSM DASH. Default URL: https://<hostname>:16311/ibm/console 

e. Inspect the trace.log file found here: <JazzSM_Home>/profile/logs/server1 

 

Example entry: 


[1/9/15 15:11:35:043 BRST] 00000084 WebSecurityCo > <init> Entry
Subject:
Principal: /UNAUTHENTICATED
Public Credential: com.ibm.ws.security.auth.WSCredentialImpl@6336c402

<null>
<null>
[1/9/15 15:11:35:043 BRST] 00000084 WebSecurityCo < <init> Exit"

In the above example the global security setting appEnabled was set to "false.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Resolve the global security configuration issue. If "Enable Application Security" is not enabled (true) then change it to be enabled: 


1. From WebSphere Admin Console (WAC) as the primary administrator user:

NOTE: Default WAC URL: https://<hostname>:16316/ibm/console

a. Go to: Security -> Global Security

b. In the Global Security panel locate the section titled "Application Security" make sure that there is a check in the box next to "Enable application security". 

c. Restart WebSphere to make the change effective.

- OR -

2. As root (on UNIX) or administrative user on Windows change this setting within the security.xml file:

Location: <JazzSM_Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml

a. Create a backup copy of security.xml

b. Change the second line to have: appEnabled="true" and save the file.

c. Restart WebSphere to make the change effective.
