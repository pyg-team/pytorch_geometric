 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSource GNU Glibc is used by IBM Netezza Host Management. IBM Netezza Host Management has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-8778 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8778]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bound memory access and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111086 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111086] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-8779 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8779]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the catopen function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111087 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111087] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-9761 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9761]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nan function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085] for the current score

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Security Patching for IBM PureData System for Analytics appliances [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615012] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Mitigation of the reported CVEs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) applies to the following platforms only:

PureData System for Analytics N1001
IBM Netezza High Capacity Appliance C1000
IBM Netezza 1000
IBM Netezza 100

CVE-2014-9761: Do not use any applications which call the affected nan* functions. These functions are used only very rarely.
CVE-2015-8778: Do not use any applications which call hcreate or hcreate_r with a large size argument. These functions are used only rarely, and most callers supply a constant argument. Other applications calculate the size argument in such a way that the error condition cannot be triggered.
CVE-2015-8779: Do not use applications which call catopen with unbounded strings. The catopen function is rarely used. Typical application usage involves passing a short, constant string to catopen, so most applications are not affect even if they call catopen.
