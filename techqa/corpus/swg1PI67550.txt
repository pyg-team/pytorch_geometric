APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Installation Manager to install MobileFirst Platform
   Foundation V8 on the BASE version of Liberty, if it is selected
   to install Application Center during the installation, the
   installation will fail with an error message that says "Liberty
   edtion BASE is not supported".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the MobileFirst application to be deployed on the server
   does not require any features that present in Liberty BASE but
   not in Liberty Core, the installation can be completed by
   installing on the Liberty Core instead of BASE.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Liberty BASE inclusion was causing error in MFP
   installation, hence only Liberty Core was supported. Later on
   discussion with OM and architects of WAS it was decided taht we
   cant stop support for Liberty BASE. It has to continue. Hence
   the code was modified to add support to Libert BASE in 8.0 and
   also handle the error which were getting previously.
