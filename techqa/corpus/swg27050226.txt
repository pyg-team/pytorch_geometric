High Speed Scan and Index Client 
The High Speed Scan and Index (" HSSI") Client is a new IBM Datacap Navigator plug-in that is targeted for high-speed scanning and indexing scenarios. This client offers improved performance as well as enhanced accessibility and usability features and simplifies the end-user actions. 

Important:  * The features listed below are available only in the new Datacap Navigator plug-in that supports High Speed Scan and Index ("HSSI") Client. These features are not available in the regular Datacap Navigator. 
 * Only one Datacap Navigator plug-in can be installed on an instance of IBM Content Navigator.



Performance Improvements  * Asynchronous upload is available as the default option in the Speed Scan Client. During upload, users do not need to wait until the upload is completed to proceed to the next task. The jobs in the queue for Asynchronous upload are auto-recoverable and the upload is resumed from the point of failure when user logs back in the application. 
 *  Improved the performance by reducing the time for pages to be scanned and displayed in the Datacap application.



Enhanced support for Daeja ViewONE Virtual document viewer 
Implementation of Daeja ViewONE Virtual as the document viewer in Datacap Navigator provides the following features:  * Improved Thumbnail view in the Speed Scan client to allow Zoom capability to the thumbnails. 
 * Improved tabbing focus in the viewer. 
 * Persistent thumbnail views and size when the viewer window is detached and reattached. 
 * Ability to manage the scanned images from a single Actions view. This feature has two benefits:  *  Less number of Actions required from the user. Improved memory consumption by the Scan Client. 
   
   

Enhancements to Panel Designer
These features enable Datacap Administrator to perform the following actions: 

 * Define a look-up button and map the task profile that is defined in Datacap Studio for performing REST/SOAP/Database services look-up. 
 * Ability to customize the tab order and define Hot Key for look-up button.


Enhancements to Usability
These features enable the users to perform the following actions: 

 * Limited tab cycle between Batch Structure and Field panel in the Index client to improve productivity. 
 * Added View History button in the Speed Scan and Speed Index clients for ease of reference of the batch history. 
 * The Speed Scan Client scanner properties reflect the default values in the task settings, or the custom scanner settings if the selected scan source has custom settings. 
 * The values displayed in the Speed Scan Client UI during scan are the same values used to perform the scan for all the scan operators. 
 * Added a confirmation dialog when user closes the clients.


Centralized Scanner Setting 

 * Datacap Administrator can now define a group of users that is allowed to update the Scanner Settings in the Speed Scan Client. 
 * Datacap Administrator can set the Scanner Settings to be visible in the Speed Scan task. 
 * Datacap Administrator can also set the Scanner Settings to be editable in the Speed Scan task.
