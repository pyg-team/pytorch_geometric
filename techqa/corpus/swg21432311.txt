Title: IBM Cannot augment the Deployment Manager profile with the dmgr.bspace profile template - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to augment the deployment manager profile for the cell with the dmgr.bspace profile template as documented, you receive a message similar to the following:
INSTCONFFAILED: Profile augmentation failed. For more information, consult D:\We 
bSphere70\AppServer\logs\manageprofiles\Dmgr01_augment.log.

This might occur if the deployment manager profile was initially created in WebSphere Application Server using the Cell profile template instead of using the Management profile template. The deployment manager profiles created from these profile templates have some differences. 

SYMPTOM
While reviewing the log as directed after the augmentation failure you might see the following error message: 

[..\profileTemplates\BusinessSpace\dmgr.bspace] is not a valid profile template.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must have a deployment manager profile created from a WebSphere Application Server Management profile template to augment with the dmgr.bspace profile template.
