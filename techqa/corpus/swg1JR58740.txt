APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you use wsadmin to install some SCA modules with Store and
   Forward qualifiers in offline mode, for example
   
   wsadmin.bat -conntype NONE
   
   you might see some warning message, like following message, in
   <BPM_HOME>\profiles\<Dmgr_Profile>\logs\wsadmin.traceout:
   
   Core          W   CWSCA0001W: "DetermineScoreBP.component" is
   not a valid Service Component Definition Language file for the
   following reason:
   "org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource$IOWrappedException:
   Package with uri
   'http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/wbiserver/storeAndForwa
   rd/7.0.0' not found.
   (file:///c:/BPM857/profiles/DmgrProfile/bin/DetermineScoreBP.com
   ponent, 6, 71)".
   
   The SCA modules would be installed successfully, but the Store
   and Forward feature could function incorrectly when you run
   these SCA modules.
   
   Such an issue occurs only during the first installation of an
   SCA module with Store and Forward qualifiers in a wsadmin
   command session. You don't see this issue during installation
   afterward in the same session.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install a dummy SCA module with Store and Forward qualifiers
   first in the wsadmin offline mode, and then install the real
   applications next in the same wsadmin command session.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Store and Forward component did not implement an extension which
    the classloader of IBM WebSpere Application Server used to
   initialize the EMF packages in the wsadmin offline mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that implement the extension is available for IBM BPM
   V8.6.0.0 CF 2017.12.
