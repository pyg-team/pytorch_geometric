Ask the Experts session 
12 December 2013 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EST 

Time Questions asked 00:00 General introduction 02:40 Technical introduction 03:38 How can I use command line options to find what is installed and what offerings are available in the repository? 06:05 What option can I use to uninstall ifix and fixpack? 07:43 IMShared directory is using a lot of space, is there an option to delete files from this directory? 11:27 Is it possible to change AppData agent directory from default after WebSphere Application Server and other offerings are installed? 15:24 What options do I have to install Liberty 8.5.5? 17:00 Open lines for live question and answer period 17:03 On a non-administrator install, does it have to be the user_home? Can it be directed to a shared (NFS) space? 17:40 What is the difference between WAS installation through IM and Silent mode installation? 19:21 How to import license from RAD 7.0 to 8.5.5 (trial version)? 19:51 Can you please give an overview of using IM to install ifix? 20:38 I have WAS ND 8.5.5 32-bit installed on a 32-bit linux server, and I have a new linux 64bit server that we want only the 64bit 8.5.5 WAS, and use the DMGR on the 32-bit server, how do we do this? 22:14 Why is IBM only providing Installation of WebSphere Application Server through Installation Mananger? 23:01 When we go for Ifix and when we go for fixpack, what is basic difference between those? 23:50 Can you pleasee give information about what is the use of Liberty profile and its advantages? 24:57 What do you recommend if there is a need to duplicate the WebSphere environment? 26:54 What are the basic pre-req checks for installation of Installation Manager? 28:19 Do you have a link for how to federate the 64-bit WAS ND APPSERVER to 32-bit DMGR, instructions/step (jython scripting) so it can be automated? 29:20 With WebSphere products changing the method of installation, is there a white paper, or recommended practices, for setting up a central repository? 30:33 Is there any way make a WAS back-up through Installation Manager? 30:52 Do we have to uninstall previous ifix before installing latest fix pack? 32:09 We are planning to migrate from WAS 6.1 to WAS8.5.5, can I install 8.5.5 on top of the existing 6.1 profile? Or does it have to be a fresh installation? 33:10 I have an NFS share on 3 servers and IIM is installed there. Can I utilize IIM to install/uninstall with 2 different users without any issues on all 3 servers? 34:44 Is there a document for migrating WebSphere 7 to WAS 8.7 entire cell, say node-by-node? 35:11 What provisions does WebSphere Application Server provide to prevent denial of service attacks? 35:40 If we have 32-bit 8.5.5 DMGR and 1 APPSRVR 32-bit 8.5.5 and a 2nd APPSRVR 64-bit 8.5.5, does the DMGR have to be updated first or can we update the APPServers first? That is, does the order matter for fixes? 36:58 Is it a good idea to create any dependency on the dmgr for runtime? For example, Adobe Life Cycle installed on top of WAS uses some cache mechanism called gds, gemfire, etc. 37:42 I noticed on IM with 8.5 that when you choose to install the updates, it always goes through your IBM PA account to get the updates and the latest. But with Maximo application for instance, you only want to go to 8.5.0.1 for instance, so the only way I found is run the update pointing to the repository for fix 1, and choose update and keep clicking cancel to look online to continue and install the fix 1. Is this the only way to install a fix on V8 or V8.5? 39:40 When migrating WAS from 6.1 to 8.5, do you guys recommend using the migration tool or create configurations using scripts? 40:44 To upgrade websphere from 6.1 to 8.5, What path do you suggest: fresh install or migration proces?. If you suggest migration process where can I get the documentation? 42:34 To get to WAS 8.0 from WAS 8.1, is this a migration process only? 42:57 What is the latest fix pack available on top of 8.5.5.0 base (and location to down load from Passport Advantage)? 43:37 Is there a fixed release scheduled for FixPacks? I hear that it's every 3 months or so. 44:24 If I have 1000 servers to apply FP, whats the recommended method to apply fixes to large number of servers in minimum time; any tools available? 47:01 I have IIM, WASND, WAS installed and configured per application's requirement. Now, I want to install another instance of WAS. Does IIM have an option to take the existing WAS as a template so that I can get the configuration also? 47:49 We are planning to upgrade from 6.1 to 8.5.5.0. What's the stable version (already being used by companies)? 48:45 Closing remarks 50:05 End of Call
