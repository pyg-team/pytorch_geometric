APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If WBI-FN MSIF receives a File which contains a blank in the
   FileInfo Tag (e.g.:
   <Sw:FileInfo>SwCompression=None; ;Test=Y</Sw:FileInfo>
   
   Error events

   c3e2d840e6d4c9f14040404040404040c4a64c4830d4038c  Processing the
   message of type SNL_SERVER (SNL Sw:HandleFileRequest) failed for
   'RCV'
   request 'Initial' in state 'Initial' and condition 'new'; see
   event 'DNFO9501E' for more information.

   error;
   reason='org.w3c.dom.DOMException: INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An
   invalid or illegal XML character is specified. '.
   
   are raised, and CIN stops processing;
   continue of File processing (successful CIN restart) is only
   possible after deleting the request message for this transfer
   from the Queue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact the sender of the file and ask to specify FileInfo as
   defined by SWIFT

   ****************************************************************
   Formerly, when WebSphere BI for FN MSIF received a file which
   contained a blank in the FileInfo tag, error events DNFO1057E
   and DNFO9501E were raised, and CIN stopped processing. To
   continue file processing (successful CIN restart) was possible
   only after deleting the request message for this transfer
   from the queue. That required to contact the sender of the
   file and ask to specify FileInfo as defined by SWIFT.
   Now, the behaviour is changed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CIN STOPS ON RECEIVING A FILE WITH A BLANK IN FILEINFO TAG
   This behaviour is changed.
