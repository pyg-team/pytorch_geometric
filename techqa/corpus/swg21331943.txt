PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Daylight Savings issue with MS C++ MFC, and what is the impact on Cognos products? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
We have consulted with the Microsoft Technical team, and from a Cognos perspective, we do not believe this bug will have any impact. The buggy function "cvtdate" is used in Visual C++ Runtime (CRT), but Cognos utilizes the ANSI standard because our software must run on UNIX.

This bug boils down to a time/date (timestamp) being off by one hour for one week until the Daylight Savings function corrects itself. Previous timestamps from the anomalous period will probably not be corrected. From a business perspective, the impact is minimal. Microsoft indicated that they will fix the bug in its next update for Visual Studio and Windows.

You may see this bug in your OS system clock, which will effect timestamps. For example, we changed the system clock to April 2, 2001. We then opened PowerPlay, created a report and published it to Upfront. The timestamp for the report in Upfront was off by one hour. This is an attribute of the Microsoft OS and not Cognos products.
