QUESTION
 How do I convert local profiles into IBM Rational Rhapsody Design Manager domains and assign them to my Design Manager project area? 

CAUSE
Actively Managed (AMM) project areas in Design Manager allow the project area administrator to manually assign system-defined and user-created domains to that project area, allowing models contained within to be displayed with the appropriate ontology. Externally Managed (EMM) project areas do not present this option to the administrator.

ANSWER
Design Manager will automatically apply a custom domain to an Externally Managed project area if a model being imported into that project area via the Import Engine has a custom profile assigned and the profile has a corresponding domain on the Design Manager server in the Domains project area. 

In order to achieve this, the following must be true: 

 

1) The custom profile must be located in the Rhapsody share\profile folder on the client, and have been created with a text file with the same name as the .sbs file, in the same folder. This allows a Rhapsody project to be created of that 'type'. 

 

Example: 

 

C:\Users\John\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.3\Share\Profiles\MyProfile\MyProfile_rpy\MyProfile.sbs 

C:\Users\John\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.3\Share\Profiles\MyProfile\MyProfile_rpy\MyProfile.txt 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016594&amp;aid=1]


2) Design Manager -> Create / Update Domain is performed from within Rhapsody while the model that defines the custom profile is open. This is required in order for the profile itself to be writable, and thus receive the property changes to the .sbs file which are introduced when publishing a profile as a domain. 

 

Example: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016594&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016594&aid=2] 

 

3) The entire custom profile folder must be copied to the Import Engine share folder. The Import Engine may be installed on the same computer as the Rhapsody client, or it may be installed on a separate computer. * 

 

Example: 

 

Copy - C:\Users\John\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.3\Share\Profiles\MyProfile 

To - C:\Tools\IBM\Import Engine\RhapsodyModelServer\Share\Profiles\MyProfile 

 

4) The entire custom profile folder must be copied to the Design Manager share folder on the server. The Rhapsody client will almost certainly be installed on a different computer to the Design Manager server. * 

 

Example: 

 

Copy - C:\Users\John\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.3\Share\Profiles\MyProfile 

To - C:\DesignManager605\RhapsodyModelServer\Share\Profiles\MyProfile 

 

 

Now a model that uses the profile can be imported into an Externally Managed project area in Design Manager via the Import Engine. 

Design Manager will recognise that the model uses a custom profile (e.g. MyProfile) and that a corresponding domain (e.g. MyProfile) for that profile already exists. That domain will be automatically assigned to the project area during the import. 

 

* Each time the content of the profile changes and the domain is updated, it is necessary to repeat these steps to ensure that the latest version of the profile is available to both the Import Engine and Design Manager.
