APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Two options are missing from the "Directory to install
   application" field description within the "Select installation
   options settings" topic. This issue pertains specifically to
   the WebSphere Application Server (Base) documentation. There
   are five options for specifying the directory to install
   applications. Two of the five options are missing from this
   documentation. These two options use the $(CELL) variable.

   the "Select installation options settings" needs to be

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The description for the Directory to install application field
   has been updated. The following information is a complete
   description of the field and replaces the information in the
   current description for the WebSphere Application Server
   product:
   
   Directory to install application
   Specifies the directory to which the enterprise archive (EAR)
   file will be installed.
   
   By default, the EAR file is installed in the
   profile_root/installedApps/cell_name/application_name.ear
   directory.
   Setting options include the following:
   -Do not specify a value and leave the field empty.
    If you do not specify a directory for Directory to install
    application, the default value of APPDEPL_INSTALL_DIR is used.
    The default value is APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name, where the
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT variable is profile_root/installedApps. A
    directory having the EAR file name of the application being
    installed is appended to APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name. Thus, if
    you do not specify a directory, the EAR file is installed in
    the profile_root/installedApps/cell_name/application_name.ear
    directory.
   
   -Specify a directory.
    If you specify a directory for Directory to install
    application, the application is installed in
    specified_path/application_name.ear directory. A directory
    having the EAR file name of the application being installed is
    appended to the path that you specify for Directory to install
    application. For example, if you are installing Clock.ear and
    specify C:/myapps on Windows machines, the application is
    installed in the myapps/Clock.ear directory. The
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT variable is set to the specified path.
   
   -Specify ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for the initial
    installation of the application.
    If you intend to export the application from one cell and
    later install the exported application on a different cell,
    specify the $(CELL) variable for the initial installation of
    the application. For example, specify
    ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for this setting. Exporting the
    application creates an enhanced EAR file that has the
    application and its deployment configuration. The deployment
    configuration retains the cell name of the initial
    installation in the destination directory unless you specify
    the $(CELL) variable. Specifying the $(CELL) variable ensures
    that the destination directory has the current cell name, and
    not the original cell name.
   
    Important: If an installation directory is not specified when
    an application is installed on a single-server configuration,
    the application is installed in APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name.
    When the server is made a part of a multiple-server
    configuration (using the addNode utility), the cell name of
    the new configuration becomes the cell name of the deployment
    manager node. If the -includeapps option is used for the
    addNode utility, then the applications that are installed
    prior to the addNode operation still use the installation
    directory APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name. However, an application
    that is installed after the server is added to the network
    configuration uses the default installation directory
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT/network_cell_name. To move the application to
    the APP_INSTALL_ROOT/network_cell_name location upon running
    the addNode operation, explicitly specify the installation
    directory as ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) during installation.
    In such a case, the application files can always be found
    under APP_INSTALL_ROOT/current_cell_name.
   
   -If the application has been exported and you are installing
    the exported EAR file in a different cell or location, specify
    $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/cell_name/application_name.ear if you did
    not specify ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for the initial
    installation.
   
    The exported EAR file is an enhanced EAR file that has the
    application and its deployment configuration. The deployment
    configuration retains the value for Directory to install
    application that was used for the previous installation of the
    application. Unless you specify a different value for
    Directory to install application for this installation, the
    enhanced EAR file will be installed to the same directory as
    for the previous installation.
   
    If you did not specify the $(CELL) variable during the initial
    installation, the deployment configuration uses the cell name
    of the initial installation in the destination directory. If
    you are installing on a different cell, specify
    $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/cell_name/application_name.ear, where
    cell_name is the name of the cell to which you want to install
    the enhanced EAR file. If you do not designate the current
    cell name, cell_name will be the original cell name even
    though you are installing the enhanced EAR file on a cell that
    has a different name.
   
   -Specify an absolute path or a use pathmap variable.
    You can specify an absolute path or use a pathmap variable
    such as ${MY_APPS}. You can use a pathmap variable in any
    installation.
   
    This Directory to install application field is the same as the
    Location (full path) setting on an Application binaries page.
    Data Type  String
    Units  Full path name
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the March 2008
   update to the information centers.
