PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When viewing fax images in DotEdit or DotScan, the images appeared "scrunched". The images were described as short and wide, or tall and skinny, depending on the rotation. When viewed in other viewers, like Microsoft's Viewer, the images appeared fine. 

CAUSE
The page dimensions (width and height) were of varying dimensions, causing the "scrunched" appearance.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the EqualizeUnbalancedImage action from the Equalize Action Library on each image before rotation. This will normalize the dimensions of the image and allow proper viewing.
