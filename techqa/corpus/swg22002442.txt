QUESTION
 What files require modification when updating, upgrading, moving, or migrating a System Monitor MSSQL database in IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor 5.2 

ANSWER
The files are:
$CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cfg/cala_rex_finca.cfg

$CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cfg/cala_rex_srv.cfg

$CENIT_ROOT/.prodinfo/FSM_SERVER.settings

$CENIT_ROOT/eventserver/cfg/db-cfg.xml

$CENIT_ROOT/gui/cfg/db-cfg.xml

$CENIT_ROOT/initdb/cfg/db-cfg.xml



There is a chance that a monitor could be configured to check the status of the monitor's database server, in which case the MSSQL database server name is also defined in this file:

$CENIT_ROOT/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged.ctb.


Please note: If the port, user, or password changes, these must also be reflected in the above files.
