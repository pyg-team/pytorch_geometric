QUESTION
 What are the steps to remove the IBM® Rational® Agent Controller or the IBM® Data Collection Infrastructure manually from either a Microsoft® Windows® computer or a Linux® computer, if it was installed from IBM Installation Manager? 

ANSWER
To manually uninstall the Rational Agent Controller or the IBM Data Collection Infrastructure, follow these instructions. 


First Method: Installation Manager 

If you installed the Rational Agent Controller (RAC) or the Data Collection Infrastructure (DCI) by using the Installation Manager (IM), first try to uninstall the RAC or DCI by using the IM. To do this, from the IM main window, click Uninstall, select the RAC or DCI, and then follow the instructions in the wizard. If you cannot uninstall the RAC or DCI using the IM, then do the following to manually uninstall RAC or DCI. 

Note: The RAC and DCI can be a feature embedded in some offering's feature list. In this situation, to uninstall the RAC or DCI feature select Modify in the main IM window, then in the offering's feature list clear the RAC or DCI feature checkbox and proceed with the modify action. 

Second Method: Manual Alternative 
Use this method only if the first method fails or if later attempts to install the RAC or DCI fail because of items left behind after an unsuccessful attempt to uninstall. 

RAC
Stop the Rational Agent Controller (RAC) service, if it is running. 

Windows: 
In the RAC installation directory, run the \AgentController\bin\RAStop.bat script to remove the IBM Rational Agent Controller Windows service. 
Alternately, type the following at a command prompt:
\AgentController\bin\manageservice.exe remove "IBM Rational Agent Controller"
If the manageservice.exe file does not exist, try installing the RAC on another Windows computer, and then copy the manageservice.exe file from there.
Use the Services control panel to stop the RAC service, or use Task Manager to end the ACWinService.exe and TPTP*.exe processes. 

Linux: 
In the RAC installation directory, run the /AgentController/bin/RAStop.sh script. 
Alternately, to find the process to stop, type the following at a command prompt:
ps -ef | grep -i RAS 
Use the kill command to stop the process. Repeat this for any running TPTP* processes. 
Remove the "AgentController" directories.

Important: In the case where multiple products have been installed from the IM, you should uninstall them using the IM before deleting these folders: 
Windows: 
C:/Program Files/IBM/SDP 
C:/Program Files/IBM/IBMIMShared 
Linux: 
/opt/IBM/SDP 
/opt/IBM/IBMIMShared

DCI
Stop the Data Collection Infrastructure (DCI), if it is running. 

Windows: 
In the DCI installation directory, run the \DCI\rpa_prod\stopDCI.bat script to stop the DCI.
Alternately, Open Task Manager and select the process tapmagent.exe. Right-click and select End Process. 

Linux: 
In the DCI installation directory, run the /DCI/rpa_prod/stopDCI.bat script to stop the DCI.
Alternately, at a command prompt, type the following:
kill tapmagent.exe 

Next, remove folder IBMAGENT_70 with its content

Windows: 
Delete C:\WINDOWS\IBM\IBMAGENT_70\

Linux: 
Delete /etc/IBM/IBMAGENT_70/

Note: 
If the above does not clean up the DCI and Tivoli components, then further manual removal may be necessary; see Tivoli cleanup below. 

Remove the "DCI" directories.

Important: In the case where multiple products have been installed from the IM, you should uninstall them using the IM before deleting these folders: 

Windows: 
C:/Program Files/IBM/SDP 
C:/Program Files/IBM/IBMIMShared 

Linux: 
/opt/IBM/SDP 
/opt/IBM/IBMIMShared


Tivoli cleanup 
The following steps remove the Tivoli components installed with the IBM Data Collection Infrastructure (DCI). Follow these instructions if the DCI remains after uninstalling through Installation Manager.
Note: Do not remove these items if you have another product using the RAC or if you installed the RAC without using the IM. (The RAC is part of the DCI individual installation.)

On Windows, remove the following:
C:/Windows/IBM/IBMAGENT_70
C:/Windows/vpd.properties 

Do not delete the vpd.properties file if it has entries other than ITCAM. In that case, remove only ITCAM entries starting with: 
"ITCAMTTR|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_Base|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_win|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_linix86|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|" 
Remove the following directories: 
C:/Program Files/Common Files/InstallShield/Universal/ibmrac
C:/Program Files/Common Files/InstallShield/Universal/ipotdci 
Remove the following registry keys: 
HKLM/SOFTWARE/IBM/Rational Agent Controller
HKLM/SOFTWARE/IBM/Rational/Software Development Platform/products/com.ibm.rational.data.collection.infrastructure
HKLM/SOFTWARE/Tivoli/Tivoli Transerf Service/parameters 

On Linux, remove the following:

/etc/IBM/IBMAGENT_70
/root/vpd.properties 
Do not delete the vpd.properties file if it has entries in it other than ITCAM. In that case, remove only ITCAM entries starting with: 
"ITCAMTTR|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_Base|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_win|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_linix86|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|" 
Remove the following directories: 
/root/InstallShield/Universal/ibmrac
/root/InstallShield/Universal/ipotdci
