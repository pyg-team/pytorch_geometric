com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.COIWrapperPluginImpl.buildLogicalComponentInstances)

at: com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.COIWrapperPluginImpl.buildLogicalComponentInstance 
s(COIWrapperPluginImpl.java:700) 


CAUSE
The BIRTExtension is installed by the product which is deployed with TIP, not TIP itself. If you try to install BIRTExtension while installing TIP fix pack the upgrade may fail with above errors.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This can typically happen if you are using a response file for installation of TIP fix pack. The response file have following lines as an example. These lines tell the installer what components to install. 

 

#IAGLOBAL_COI_SELECTED_LOGICAL_COMPONENTS=Common,TIPFinal,BIRTExtension
#IAGLOBAL_COI_SELECTED_LOGICAL_COMPONENTS=Common,TIPFinal 

 

If you have un-commented the first line then comment out that line and un-comment the second line which does not have BIRTExtension (or remove ,BIRTExtension from the first line) . After this try installation again.
