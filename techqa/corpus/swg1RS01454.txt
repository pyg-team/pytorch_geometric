ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running a DVS test with the "Create an Excel file
   separate from the report to store the output values" option,
    it may take a long time to generate the resulting Excel file
   when clicking on "Click here to download the output
   values" in the report.
   
   This occurs when the ruleset parameters include collections (a
   deep model as opposed to a flatened model): the generation of
   the report make take minutes, even 30 minutes, to complete.
