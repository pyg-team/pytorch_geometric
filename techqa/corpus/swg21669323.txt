CONTENT
These five updated products in the IBM CICS Tools V5.2 family combine together to increase the value of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V5.2. CICS Tools V5.2 support the new features, resources, options, and metrics in CICS TS V5.2. They improve the operational efficiency and service agility of systems that power much of modern business. CICS Tools enable development, systems, and operational teams to adopt a collaborative, DevOps approach, by working together to plan, design, build, test, deploy, manage, and optimize CICS applications and infrastructure. With the CICS V5.2 family, it is now quicker and easier to build mobile-enabled applications and deploy them in a CICS cloud. 
CICS Tools V5.2 satisfies many user requirements. See customer requirements answered in CICS 5.2 Tools [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27041591] to learn about each user requirement that will be delivered in CICS Tools V5.2.

Key enhancements delivered by products in the CICS Tools V5.2 portfolio:


 * CICS IA V5.2 collects more information about applications and platforms, to help clients create a more dynamic CICS cloud environment. The new Command Flow visualization provides yet more insight into program behavior. A new variable sampling technique is introduced to help reduce the CPU overhead by up to 75% while collecting data. This technique can be applied to production regions to balance the impact of collection, the fidelity of the data collected, and production throughput. 
 * CICS DA V5.2 introduces a new RESTful API that allows the deep insight captured in the discovered model to be shared with other management tools, or viewed from mobile devices and browsers. New cloning options deliver value to a wider range of client environments. A new compare option highlights key differences in region configuration and helps to ensure standards conformance and system reliability. 
 * CICS PA V5.2 supports the CICS cloud with new Performance Summary reports for platforms and applications, while multi-version application support enables fine-grained analysis of ever-changing mobile applications. New, simply configured, batch reporting of CICS TS and CICS Transaction Gateway (CICS TG) statistics provides a wealth of valuable diagnostic and planning information. Plug-in enhancements, that include new Performance Alerts, and more advanced visualization and analysis, help development and systems staff to identify and resolve performance issues quickly. 
 * CICS CM V5.2 improves DevOps collaboration with new plug-in support for Migration Schemes and Deployment Analysis. New support to manage CICSPlex SM (CPSM) Topology and Workload Management definitions allows dynamic mobile workloads to be quickly reconfigured. 
 * CICS VR V5.2 adds new support for extended address volumes (EAVs), and delivers usability, installation, coexistence, and customization enhancements. CICS VR provides Disaster Recovery support for online data and operation support for batch to minimize the batch window. CICS also supports the replication of VSAM data for IBM GDPS Active-Active continuous availability, enabling cross-site workload balancing, continuous availability, and disaster recovery. 


CICS Optimization Solution Pack for z/OS V5.2 is updated to include the new releases of CICS IA, CICS DA, CICS PA, and CICS CM.
