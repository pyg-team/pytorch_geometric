APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is running on Win2k, Access Manager 4.1 WebSEAL
   running FP6 and LDAP 4.1 FP2.
   .
   The customer also has two junctions, one Public, (UNAUTH ACL)
   and the other Private (Default-WebSEAL ACL).
   .
   After doing a few redirects via links on some password change
   pages, WebSEAL goes down.  No Dr. Watson.
   .
   I was able to successfully recreate this issue on an AIX 5.2 box
   at the same level of code.
   .
   I have gathered a senddata for my recreated box to help with the
   troubleshooting of this issue.
   .
   I placed this datapkg on ftp site pdlevel3
   .
   /pmrs/67532,004
   .
   The RECREATE STEPS are as follows from my recreate.
   .
   When I did the recreate, I just created two junctions called
   PUBLIC and PRIVATE with UNAUTH ACL applied to Public and the
   default-webseal acl applied to the Private junction.  These
   junctions where just linked to two websites. I then
   manually changed links via the address bar in IE.  (Note change
   from HTTP to HTTPS, this is a factor in the recreate.
   .
   .
   1. Access http://webseal/public (no login)
   2. Change link in url to https://webseal/private [https://webseal/private]
   3. Login with test user
   4. Change password https://webseal/pkmspasswd [https://webseal/pkmspasswd]
   5. At the password change success page, change link again to
      http://webseal/public [http://webseal/public]
   6. Then again change back to https://webseal/private [https://webseal/private]
   7. WebSEAL Cores or goes down at this point
   .
   See customers comments below on recreate.

      Hi Lance,
   .
      I have recreated problem... I can cause WebSEAL crash by
   creating 2
   junctions: /public, which points to a HTTP server, and /private,
   going
   to the TAM WPM. On the HTTP Server index.html page, I added a
   link to it
   pointing to the private junction (
   https://webseal_server_name/private/pdadmin ). I then open a
   browser,
   and go to http://webseal_server_name/public , which brings up my
   modified HTTP page. I select the link I added, and browser
   switches to
   https session, and I get BA challenge from WebSEAL. I login, and
   pdwpm
   login page is displayed. I then enter
   https://webseal_server_name/pkmspasswd to go to change password
   page. I
   change the password, and then get the password changed page. I
   initially
   placed links on this page, one to the /public and one to the
   /private
   junctions, and WebSEAL would crash. I have found, however, that
   using
   the default message page, I can still cause WebSEAL to crash.
   From the
   default page, I reenter the /public junction URL in the browser,
   then
   reselect the link to switch to https ( go back to
   /private/pdadmin ),
   and this will crash WebSEAL as well.. in other words, without
   changes
   any WebSEAL pages, I can cause WebSEAL to crash.. Catch me when
   you get
   in, and I can go over.. Thanks..
