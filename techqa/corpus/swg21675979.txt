Title: IBM Sticky field not propagating with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
sticky checkbox TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In an application configured for the Sticky function in prelayout.aspx, the value does not propagate even when the Sticky checkbox is checked in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture. 

CAUSE
Although the Sticky feature is intended to provide a method to propagate values to subsequent pages, the option itself only makes the checkbox feature. It does not provide the actual functionality to move the value.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Datacap Taskmaster does not provide a method to move the value when Sticky is checked. A custom action must be written to provide this functionality.

This solution is specific to 8.0.1. For 8.1, see the Datacap Knowledge Center, Sticky Variable [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_8.1.0/com.ibm.dc.develop.doc/dcadg480.htm?lang=en].
