 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The purpose of this document is to provide a tutorial for installation of IBM Tivoli Monitoring
6.3.0.2 and IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) for Applications 7.3 in a Linux machine. 

CONTENT
The overall objective is to have ITM and ITCAM services monitoring MQ queue managers in 

Windows and in Linux, and additional tutorials will provide steps for other components.

The Tivoli agents in Linux will connect to the "Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server - TEMS" that was setup in the following techdoc:

Installation of ITM 6.0.3.2 in Windows to monitor MQ queue managers

In order to keep the overall scenario as simple as possible, only the most essential
components will be installed. Therefore, this tutorial does not show other ITM and ITCAM components; of course, if you need additional components, then you can go ahead and install/configure
them.
