Title: IBM Rule Team Server/Decision Center does not use the Intellirule editor for rules that are created from templates - United States

Text:
template; editor; freeze; RTS; BAL; Intellirule; guided TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center use the guided editor for rules that are created from templates even when the RTS/Decision Center settings are defined to use the Intellirule editor? 

CAUSE
The Intellirule editor does not allow you to freeze sections of BAL rules, so it would allow a user to modify sections that were frozen in the template.

ANSWER
The Intellirule editor is therefore not made available in RTS/Decision Center for rules created from templates, to guaranty that frozen sections will not be changed by business users.
