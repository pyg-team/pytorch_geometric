QUESTION
 Why does Atlas Hold Notice not change to Sent status after publish? 

CAUSE
Hold Notice remained in the Published status and could be caused by timer task not running

ANSWER
 

 1. Review Atlas logs and identify the error message if any 
 2. Verify if Atlas database was restarted without restarting the Application server 
 3. Verify if Java Heap Size set for the Atlas application server is sufficient. You can refer to this technote (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990551) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990551]
