APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In InfoSphere Data Replication for VSAM 11.3.0, when attempting
   to run a batch performance test using CICSVR and IIDR, the
   target server log is swamped with 1000s of CECW0027I, CECW0029I
   and CECW0030I messages.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Data Replication for VSAM                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Customer has 8 batch jobs running on    *
   *                      6 LPARs. If a block is being read       *
   *                      from one LPAR and VSAM LRI finds that   *
   *                      a job from a second LPAR                *
   *                      needs a commit, the log reader sends    *
   *                      a log block header and a manufactured   *
   *                      commit for the second LPAR and sets     *
   *                      a flag saying the log block header      *
   *                      was sent. This causes the block         *
   *                      header from the first LPAR to not be    *
   *                      sent and changes in the block are       *
   *                      incorrectly associated with the         *
   *                      second LPAR.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a CICS VR log block is read, a check is made to see to
   see if any tracked jobs need to be committed.  The commit
   is generated if 50 blocks have been read since the last
   non-recoverable commit for the stream was done.  Also, 2
   seconds must have passed since the last non-recoverable commit
   for the job and the time in the current log block header, and
   that job must also have changes sent to the capture service
   that haven't been committed. If a block is being read
   from one LPAR and VSAM LRI finds that a job from a second
   LPAR needs a commit, the log reader sends a log block header
   and a manufactured commit for the second LPAR and sets
   a flag saying the log block header was sent. This causes the
   block header from the first LPAR to not be sent and changes
   in the block are incorrectly associated with the second LPAR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Classic code will be changed to reset a flag after the
   generated commit processing to ensure the current log block
   header being read is sent to the capture service. This will
   allow the changes in the block to be associated with the
   correct LPAR.
