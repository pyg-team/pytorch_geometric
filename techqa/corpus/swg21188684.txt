Title: IBM WINDOWS: Uninstalling XDE - United States

Text:
uninstall; reinstall; install; 1188684 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If an IBM Rational® XDE™ installation was interrupted or damaged so that it cannot be uninstalled using normal Windows procedures, or a complete uninstall of XDE is required in order to complete a re-install without conflict, these procedures will restore a system to a state without XDE. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
XDE 2002/2002 SR2 UNINSTALL/INSTALL PROCEDURES 

==============================================

1. If XDE is integrated with Rational ClearCase, rebase the views before proceeding with an uninstall.

2. Back-up or remove existing projects

The project files should be removed if a complete uninstall is desired. If XDE is to be reinstalled or upgraded, then the 

project files can be left alone, but a backup should be made to aid recovery if additional problems should appear.

The project directories are typically under My Documents on the drive where Windows is installed. The project folders will 

be in a subdirectory called "XDE Workspace" (for Java) or "Visual Studio Projects" (for .NET). The project folders can also 

be found by doing a search of local drives for files named '*.wdx'. Files found in directories under C:\Program 

Files\Rational\XDE (or the XDE program directory if different from the default) can be ignored.

For Windows 2000/XP:
XDE projects are stored by default in the user's My Documents under the C:\Documents and Settings directory away from the 

XDE program files.

For Windows NT 4.0:
XDE projects are stored by default in the user's My Documents directory under the C:\WINNT\profiles directory away from the 

XDE program files.

Back up each project directory separately and restore into the "XDE Workspace" or "Visual Studio Projects" directory (which 

may be located elsewhere based on XDE configuration choices) after re-install.


3. Uninstall using Windows Control Panel Add/Remove Programs:

If XDE is missing from the Add/Remove Programs list, start the Rational un-installer manually with this command:
'C:\Program Files\Rational\RSSetup\rssetup.exe" /uninstall /product XDE"'
Note: Make sure there is a SPACE between all entries above (i.e. rssetup.exe <SPACE> /uninstall <SPACE> /product <SPACE> 

XDE).


4. Remove all remaining XDE program files and directories. The path to the program files by default is:
'C:\Program Files\Rational\XDE'
Delete this directory and all its contents.

Delete per-user XDE configuration data under each user's Application Data directory:

For Windows 2000 the path to the configuration files by default is:
'C:\Documents and Settings\(user)\Application Data\Rational\XDE'
where (user) is the Windows login of each user who accesses XDE on this system.

For Windows NT 4.0 the path to the project files by default is:
'C:\WINNT\profiles\(user)\Application Data\Rational\XDE'
where (user) is the Windows login of each user who accesses XDE on this system.

The Application Data folder is a hidden folder. If the user doesn't see the Application Data folder configure Windows 

Explorer to see hidden folders.


5. For a complete uninstall, remove XDE project directories.

These are the directories and files identified in Step 1. If a backup has been made, and/or a complete uninstall is desired, 

then remove the "XDE Workspace" directory. Since the "Visual Studio Projects" directory is shared with Microsoft Visual 

Studio, do not remove this directory.


6. Remove XDE program settings from the Registry.

=======================
WARNING
Using the Windows Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require a reinstall of the operating 

system. Rational cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use 

Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor 

(Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe. Note 

that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If you are running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also 

update your Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

Rational requires you to make a Windows Emergency Repair Disk or otherwise backup the Registry before altering the Registry. 

See the topic below: RESTORING THE REGISTRY
=======================

The XDE (for Java or .NET) registry keys to be removed are:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rational Software\XDE]
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rational Software\XDE]

Using Regedit.exe, select each of these folders, press the "Del" key or choose menu: Edit > Delete, and choose "Yes" in the 

"Confirm Key Delete" dialog box. After both keys are deleted, exit Regedit.exe.


7. Reboot. This permits Windows to restart using the updated/clean registry settings.

8. Remove any shortcuts or Start Menu items manually.

9. If reinstallation will follow, skip down to the " REINSTALLING XDE" steps, below.

Removing the Microsoft VS.NET Integration:
1. Start VS.NET
VS.NET will report "Help is updating your help file contents based on recent changes. This may take several minutes." 

Afterward, this warning will be reported:
===
Package Load Failure
Package 'rtepackage Package' has failed to load properly ( GUID = {C59EF73F-55D1-402D-A4F4-23BB8E07F302} ). Please contact 

package vendor for assistance. Would you like to disable loading this package in the future? You may use 'devenv 

/resetskippkgs' to re-enable package loading. Application restart is recommended, due to possible environment corruption.
[Yes] [No]
===
2. Respond to the warning by clicking the "Yes" button.
3. Close VS.NET.

Removing the IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSSAD) Integration
1. Remove from "C:\Program Files\IBM\Application Developer\plugins" the directories:
com.rational.xde_1.0
com.rational.hshell.ratltool
com.rational.hshell.ratltoolstartup
2. Remove from "C:\Documents and Settings\(user)\My Documents\XDE Workspace\.metadata\.plugins" the directories:
com.rational.hshell.ratltool
3. Repeat step 2 for each separate user on this system.
4. Start WSSAD.
WSSAD will report once "Errors during startup" but will then be functional without XDE extensions.
5. Close WSSAD.


REINSTALLING XDE
================

1. Before installing, stop all other running applications.
Windows may start helper applications and a virus scanner automatically after reboot. Stop these programs as well before 

re-installing.

NT: Press CTRL-ALT-DELETE. A Windows NT Security dialog box will appear. Click Task Manager. Under the Applications tab, 

click an item, and click End Task.

Make sure any virus checking program currently running is disabled.

2. Install XDE
If the install process requires a reboot, log in again once using the same login id used to start the install. This permits 

the setup program to complete any tasks postponed until after a reboot.

3. Questions if problems continue:

* install log
During install XDE will create a text file listing what is being
done during that install. This file is named RSSETUP.LOG. Default location:
'C:\Program Files\Rational\RSSetup'

Please forward this file to support.
* Any other errors returned during install? If so what _exact_ ones?
* Which exact operating system? Which service pack?


RESTORING THE REGISTRY

Before editing the registry, make sure it can be restored if a problem occurs. For more information see:
"Restoring the Registry Help topic in regedit.exe" or "Restoring a Registry Key Help topic in regedt32.exe"
