CVE-2014-0114
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the failure to restrict the setting of Class Loader attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the class 
parameter of an ActionForm object to manipulate the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code on the system. There is partial impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This issue has been fixed now.

CVE-2014-0050
Apache Commons FileUpload and Tomcat are vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of Content-Type HTTP header for multi-part requests. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop. This issue has been fixed by incorporating a newer version of the affected libraries.
