APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  User includes one or more datasets in the Additional SYSLIB
   Libraries section of FM panel, 0.6.
   
   At some later date, one of the libraries is deleted, but the 0.6
   panel specification is not changed.
   
   The next time the user attempts to use FM Edit, they receive a
   "Dataset Not Found" error message.
   
   Changing the message to identify the missing dataset is needed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually compare the SYSLIB concatenation and remove any missing
   dataset names.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: File Manager users working with copybooks    *
   *                 and templates.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: "Data set not found" message may be     *
   *                      received by users when trying to use    *
   *                      (compile) copybooks for formatted       *
   *                      data viewing when additional SYSLIB     *
   *                      datasets specified in COBOL or PLI      *
   *                      compiler settings have been specified   *
   *                      by the user but later on became invalid *
   *                      or not available. This message          *
   *                      correctly identifies the data set but   *
   *                      does not point out where the data set   *
   *                      name has been specified.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   Current message is providing not enough information for the user
   to be able to easily correct the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new message will be used in the above scenario and point to
   the COBOL or PLI compiler options on the Settings panel as the
   source of the invalid/missing dataset.
