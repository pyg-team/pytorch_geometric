APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This issue is similar to APAR PM56811 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM56811], but affects later WTX SAP
   Packs that use JCo3 (instead of JCo2).
   
   When using the -BPC or -BPC 2 parameter for JALE connections
   with the WTX Launcher, a core dump can occur after a period of
   time if the SAP Gateway cannot be reached.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00044737
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: Ensure that Launcher is stopped if the SAP
   Gateway is to be brought down for maintenance.
