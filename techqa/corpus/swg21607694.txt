PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In order to examine rulesfiles configurations and customisation's outside of the production environment it is sometimes necessary to use replication methods. 

CAUSE
Unable to replicate issue in a production environment

ENVIRONMENT
Test environment

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

In order to test complex systems, develop rules file code and replicate production issues
involving probes, it is necessary to understand the available methods. 

This document covers the standard methods used for event replication and loading of object servers
using probes.

The Support's Guide to Probe Event Replication covers the following probe types:

• Standard Input probe [rules file testing for all probes]
• SimNet probe [Object Server loading]
• Socket based probes [replaying TCP streamcapture]
• Tivoli EIF probe [postzmsg]
• MTTrapd probe [TCP/UDP/PACKET DATA]
