APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the maintenance task of the IBM Content Collector FileNet P8
   Connector runs on several primary nodes and accesses the same
   object store, numerous empty XIT objects might be created in the
   object store.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To prevent this problem, ensure that only one primary node has
   the maintenance task enabled. If there are other primary nodes
   in the system that are archiving email with the IBM Content
   Collector FileNet P8 email data model, but to different object
   stores, configure these additional object stores on the primary
   node that is running the maintenance task. This extra
   configuration is required only if each primary node uses a
   separate configuration database. However, also in a cluster
   environment aimed at high availability, it is a good practice to
   ensure that all required FileNet P8 object stores are configured
   on the primary node that runs the maintenance task.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem might occur if the following three criteria are met:
   - Multiple IBM Content Collector primary nodes are running,
   either in a clustered environment or as separate instances.
   - The maintenance task is enabled on more than one primary node.
   - Multiple primary nodes reference the same FileNet P8 object
   store.
   
   All primary nodes that have the IBM Content Collector FileNet P8
   Connector maintenance task enabled periodically query the
   configured FileNet P8 object stores to check if instances of the
   ICCMailSearchUpdateAnnotation class exist. If the class exists,
   duplicate email has been collected, and the maintenance task
   tries to consolidate the duplicate email data into the
   ICCMailSearch class.
   
   If multiple maintenance tasks are querying the same object
   store, the ICCMailSearch class might be detected by some of the
   maintenance tasks as modified by an external source. In this
   case, the maintenance task skips the current annotation instance
   and continues with the next instance. As a result, empty XIT
   objects are created. Depending on the system resources and the
   task schedule, the problem occurs for some, many, or all
   ICCMailSearch documents.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 2.2.0.3 LA011 and
   IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 2, the maintenance
   task has been updated to search for the latest ICCMailSearch
   version that contains a content element and add the duplicate
   email data to this version. In addition, when the updated
   content has been successfully added, all superseded
   versions are deleted.
