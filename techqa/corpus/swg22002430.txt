Title: IBM Unable to install the command line interface to import StoredIQ for Legal data - United States

Text:
commandline python import proxy TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I not able to install the command line interface to import StoredIQ for Legal data? 

CAUSE
The command line interface is being installed on a desktop which is using a proxy server. The proxy server requires authentication and is throwing the following error:
Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/: [https://pypi.python.org/simple/:] connection error: ('Cannot connect to proxy.', error('Tunnel connection failed: 407 authenticationrequired',))


ANSWER
The Proxy Admin setup a rule to allow access to python and updated a certificate to allow https access to an external URL.
