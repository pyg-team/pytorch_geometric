Title: IBM System Requirements: Hardware and Software Requirements for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture Version 8.0 - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This page describes the minimum system requirements to operate IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture Version 8.0. Any configuration that exceeds these minimum requirements will result in better performance.

Important: 
Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible.

Minimum system requirements

The following table specifies the minimum system requirements for an installation of each type of station: 

Station Type CPU/equiv RAM (GB) Available Disk (GB) Network (MBS) Taskmaster Server/File Server Intel® Core™ 2 Duo T7500 (2.20GHz) 
AMD Opteron™, Athlon™ or Sempron™ 3 100 (Fast) 100 Taskmaster Web Server Intel® Core™2 Duo E6850 
(3.0GHz) 
AMD Athlon™ or Sempron™ 4 80 100 Rulerunner Service Intel® Core™2 Duo E6850 
(3.0GHz) 
AMD Athlon™ or Sempron™ 3 80 100 Rulerunner Enterprise Service Intel® Core i7 879 2.93GHz 
4-core, 8-thread or better 
AMD Phenom™ or Opteron™ 4* 80 100 Scan Station Pentium Dual Core E2160 
(1.80GHz) 
AMD Athlon™ or Sempron™ 2 10 100 Verification Station Pentium Dual Core E2160 
(1.80GHz) 
AMD Opteron™, Athlon™ or Sempron™ 2 10 100 * 4 GBytes maximum for 32-bit O/S, 6 GBytes for 64-bit O/S.

Additional comments

 * The Rulerunner station provides all unattended processing, including document identification, recognition, image processing, and export of data.
 * Taskmaster Web Verification stations require Internet Explorer 6.0 or later.
 * Network is assumed to be Ethernet with TCP/IP running Microsoft file servers.



Hardware considerations

 * A file server is required to store the images and intermediate processing files.
 * The Taskmaster Server can be the same computer as the file server.
 * Additional hard disk storage is required for images.
 * Storage space needed depends on the image size and volume.
 * The Taskmaster Web Server can run on the same computer as Taskmaster Server in a secure configuration (Intranet, VPN, and so on).

Operating system support

Taskmaster 8.0 works with these Microsoft Windows systems:

 * 32-bit: Windows XP SP3, Windows 7, and Windows 2003 SP1 Server
 * 64-bit: Windows 7



Databases (Taskmaster Admin and Engine Database support)

 * In a production environment, the two primary Taskmaster databases (Admin and Engine) can reside in either Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008, and Oracle 11g, are fully supported.
 * SQL Server Express and other versions of SQL Server and Oracle are generally compatible with Taskmaster 8.0.
 * Taskmaster does not require a dedicated database server or instance; a departmental or enterprise database server can be used. 
 * IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture ships with Microsoft Jet databases for the sample application and the Datacap Studio Application Wizard in "Create new application" mode. You can view and these database by using Microsoft Access.



Scanner Support

 * ISIS drivers are supported with IBM Taskmaster Capture clients (so-called "thick" clients).
 * TWAIN drivers are used for Taskmaster Web Capture remote scan clients (so-called "thin" clients).
 * Kofax VRS v. 4.50.032 is supported with some scanners. The Kofax VRS Scanner Configuration Utility displays the supported scanners in the "Available image devices" list. To enable support, you must select "Kofax VRS Scanner" in the iScan task setup window in the Taskmaster thick client Workflow tab. 



Server virtualization technologies
