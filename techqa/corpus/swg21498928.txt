 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have a DataPower box with the ODBC license feature. I would like to be able to communicate with my Oracle RAC using DataPower's SQL Data Source object. How do I configure this? 

ANSWER
RAC uses clustered nodes with shared storage. While a normal DataPower - Oracle database connection links to an Oracle SID (a database instance name), a RAC connection links to a ServiceName (an alias for one or more database instances). The ServiceName represents a cluster of database instances. 

In the DataPower WebGUI: 

 1. On the main tab of the SQL Data Source configuration page, select Oracle as the Database Type. 
 2. Select ServiceName as the Oracle Identifier Type. Do not select the default value SID. 
 3. Depending on the RAC configuration, DataPower may need the extra information of a list of alternate servers. In that case, move to the Data Source Configuration Parameters tab and enter the following Name / Value pair:  * Name = AlternateServers 
     * Value = (Hostname=RAC_Node1:PortNumber=<port>:SID=<RAC_Node1_SID>,Hostname=RAC_Node2:PortNumber=<port>:SID=<RAC_Node2_SID>)
    
    

 *
