QUESTION
How do I set the Sametime ini flag to reject a Resolve request from the client? 

CAUSE
This flag:
- Has no impact on Resolve requests that are initiated by Sametime Applications such
as Lotus Sametime Gateway
- Is not applicable for web clients which are resolved by a Sametime Proxy server application
(and not by Sametime Community server). 

Therefore, a Web client can still search and resolve internal users even though the flag 
REJECT_RESOLVE_REQUESTS_FROM_CLIENT is set to 1.


ANSWER
Using the Sametime ini flag to reject a Resolve request from the client. 

This feature is disabled by default.
To enable this feature:
1. Set the REJECT_RESOLVE_REQUESTS_FROM_CLIENT flag to 1 in the [Config] section of the 
sametime.ini file and save the file.
2. Restart the StResolve Service application to make the change effective.
