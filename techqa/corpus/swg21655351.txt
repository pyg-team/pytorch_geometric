Workplace XT; SSL; WAS; Websphere Application Server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In order to use IBM FileNet Workplace (WP) or IBM FileNet Workplace XT (WPXT) without SSL or in an SSO/Container Managed configuration, with IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) version 8.5.x or higher, security settings must be updated. These settings permit non-SSL connections to P8 Content Engine (CE) and allow Container Managed applications to pass HTTP session information to an applet. 

CAUSE
This is related to this technote: Running P8 Client Applications with WebSphere Application Server 8.0.0.x [http://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023814]. There are additional configuration changes that need to be made in a WAS 8.5.x environment to enable IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine (CPE) applets to be opened.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server admin console.
2. Navigate to Security > Global security > Custom properties and confirm that the value for com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies is set to false. Change it to false if it is not already set. 
3. Then navigate to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name > Web Container Settings > Web Container > Session management.
4. Click the Enable cookies link under Session tracking mechanism.
5. Under General properties, un-check the box Set session cookies to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks and click Apply. 
6. Save the settings to the master configuration. 
7. Restart WAS.
