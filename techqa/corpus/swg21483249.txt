 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to license my SPSS product on a Macintosh computer. I am running the License Authorization Wizard. After I enter my authorization (or license) code, a small program bar/toolbar appears with the label "com.law.panels.main" and does not go away on its own and the licensing process never appears to complete. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Under normal circumstances the appearance of the "com.law.panels.main" program toolbar is brief and it closes on its own. When something is interfering with the licensing process (permissions, internet security software), the process does not complete and the "com.law.panels.main" program toolbar may not close properly. If you cannot terminate the program, restart the computer. When the computer has started normally, run the License Authorization Wizard but choose the 'License via Email' option and follow the prompts to license your product via this method
