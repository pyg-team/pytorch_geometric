ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is having an problem with extracting data from RPM
   with their own Custom Exchanger Application.
   
   The extract from RPM is failing. When we tried narrowing the
   data range. We were able to bring down a file, but when we use
   the needed date range the process fails. (see screen shot)
   
   We?ve been sending files of the same size for quite some time
   and this is just now become an issue. When we first started
   doing the extract we were bringing a file that included records
   from inception to date, and it was a much larger file. What has
   changed since the server was moved that is now causing these
   problems?
   We have automated production processes that are now failing
   because these extracts have to have manual intervention in order
   to run. And manual intervention that is taking from 6 hours to
   two days to resolve. I need a permanent resolution to this
   issue.
   
   
   Also answer the following questions:
   
   I questions if the settings have remained the same, you had to
   increase the Java Heap maximum size setting to run the extract.
   The previous week we had run the extract with 6 weeks worth of
   data. It would only run with three weeks worth of data after the
   move. You increased the size and we could then run the extract.
   The data range is a rolling 6 weeks; I agree there could be an
   increase in the weekly time records, though we haven?t had an
   increase in people or projects. But the end results of the
   extract or very close in row number and file size as before the
   move. This leads me to believe, something has changed.
   
   -          Please tell us whether more reports have been
   produced from the system since the move
   -          No there has been no increase or change in how we are
   using the software
   - Whether more online analysis using pivot have been taking
   places
   -          No there has been no increase or change in how we are
   using the software
   - Whether the reports/pivots execution criteria has been
   increased, e.g. time range increase.
   -          No there has been no increase or change in how we are
   using the software
   - Whether MSP import / export have been performed more
   frequently
   -          What is MSP? If this is MS Project we are not doing
   any imports/exports between RPM and MS Project.
   -          - Whether Calculate/Leveling or Copy Leveled result
   have been performed.
   No one is utilizing these features, we are not using RPM for
   resource availability or creating dependencies between tasks
   
   We have been making more attempts at doing the extract or
   running reports because they have been failing. But there has
   not been an increase in demand for reports or pivots.
   
   -       Is the daily export a new process implemented in RPM
   V.6.0.?
   -       No, this process was in place before we upgraded to 6.0
