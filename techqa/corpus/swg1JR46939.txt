APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cancel button is not handled properly under the Select or Add
   People Directory dialog.
            Instead of exiting code execution, a default value
   provided  inside the Add People Directory dialog is being
   validated (bpe/stuff/expressworkflow), and an error dialog
   created.
            Once user selects OK button, the error message dialog
   is closed and a human task editor tab is opened.
            This tab does not contain anything but an error message
   indicating that default value of JNDI name, which was provided
   in the  Select or Add People Directory, was not found.
   
   If human task editor tab stays open, and IID is closed, the next
    time user starts IID, the Add People Directory dialog will show
    up while workspace is being loaded, and user will be asked
            for correct input. If it happens that the license
   validation occurs at the same time, the license validation
   dialog will show up and users will not be able to perform any
   other operations inside
            the IID UI but to close IID.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround is available. Users may re-import projects into a
   clean workspace, and make sure they close a Human Task Editor
   tab before they exit IID workspace.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Cancel button is not handled properly under the Select or Add
   People Directory dialog (BPEL Human Task).
