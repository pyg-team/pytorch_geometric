 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 In response to customer feedback and in order to make error recovery more resilient, the update procedure for IBM Portal Server and Web Content Manager v8.0.0.1 will be changing effective with Cumulative Fix 15. The change is small but significant, as it will affect any automation that you may have implemented, and this announcement is being made to give you time to prepare.

This change affects all platforms except z/OS. 

CONTENT
Summary of the change
Previously, unless you used special parameters, running IBM Installation Manager to apply a cumulative fix would both update the Portal product files and simultaneously configure the Portal profile. With the new procedure, Installation Manager will now only update the product files, and you will be required to run a pair of separate commands to configure the profile. Before now, the additional commands were required in certain situations; now they will be required in all upgrade cases.

The new procedure will bring non-z/OS platforms in line with the same procedure that is currently used on z/OS, as well as that used for all platforms in Portal Server v8.5, providing consistency across platforms and releases.


Details 

The new update procedure is different in two ways from the old.

1. You no longer need to provide IDs and passwords to Installation Manager.
◦ For GUI installs, you will no longer see the panels that ask for the WAS and Portal credentials, and you will not have to wait for them to be validated.
◦ For silent installs, the response file is simplified (although it does not hurt to retain the extra information-- you can safely continue using the same file.)
◦ For command line installs, the command is greatly shortened.
OLD: 

./imcl install com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80 
-repositories <fullpath/to/repository.config> 
-properties user.wp.portal.userid,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<portaladminuser>,user.wp.portal.password,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<encryptedportaladminpassword>,user.wp.was.userid,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<wasadminuser>,user.wp.was.password,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<encryptedwasadminpassword>
-installationDirectory <portal_server_root>
-acceptLicense 
NEW: ./imcl install com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80 
-repositories <fullpath/to/repository.config> 
-installationDirectory <portal_server_root> 
-acceptLicense 
2. After Installation Manager completes successfully, you must run two additional commands for every profile. 
• <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh PRE-CONFIG-WP-PTF-CF -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password> 
• <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh CONFIG-WP-PTF-CF -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password> 

Once these commands return BUILD SUCCESSFUL, the profile is updated and the procedure is complete. 

The rollback procedure will also change, in much the same way as the update. 

1. You no longer need to provide IDs and passwords to Installation Manager. 
◦ For GUI installs, you will no longer see the panels that ask for the WAS and Portal credentials, and you will not have to wait for them to be validated. 
◦ For silent installs, the response file is simplified (although it does not hurt to retain the extra information-- you can safely continue using the same file.) 
◦ For command line installs, the command is greatly shortened. 
OLD: ./imcl rollback com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80 
-properties user.wp.portal.userid,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<portaladminuser>,user.wp.portal.password,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<encryptedportaladminpassword>,user.wp.was.userid,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<wasadminuser>,user.wp.was.password,,com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80=<encryptedwasadminpassword>
-installationDirectory <portal_server_root> 
NEW: ./imcl rollback com.ibm.websphere.PORTAL.SERVER.v80 
-installationDirectory <portal_server_root> 
2. After Installation Manager completes successfully, you must run two additional commands for every profile. 
• <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh PRE-UNCONFIG-WP-PTF-CF -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password> 
• <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh UNCONFIG-WP-PTF-CF -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password> 

Once these commands return BUILD SUCCESSFUL, the profile is rolled back and the procedure is complete. Outlook 

These changes will go into effect with the release of Cumulative Fix 15, currently targeted for early first quarter 2015. The online instructions for applying the fix will be updated at that time.
