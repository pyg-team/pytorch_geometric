ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Approver:MB
   Compid:  5724C04PS Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
   
   
   Environment:
     All platforms and environments.
     This problem exists in ITM 61 base code.
   Problem Description:
     In the TEPS there is a single Snapshot object that contains
   all events.  In an environment where there are large number of
   events the snaphot object can get updated while it is still
   being read for a TEP client. This can cause different events
   to display for different TEP clients.
   
     There can also be TEP Client timeout problems that will appear
   as an event console out of synch.  The only difference is
   that on the TEP client that has timed out, there will be no
   new events displayed.  To correct this problem, please set
   the following parm in the KFWENV file for TEPS on Windows or
   in cq.ini for TEPS on Linux/AIX.
   
     KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_MAX=30
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
     The following should be done on a system that is generating at
   least 200 events simultaneously.  Though this can vary based
   on load.
   
     Have 2 TEP Clients logged in displaying the event console at
   the Enterprise view.
   
     1) Create situations that fire events quickly.
     2) Monitor the event console.
     3) Eventually the events will get out of synch.
   
   Related Files and Output:
     None.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TEP Client situation event console displays different events
   when connected to the same HUB.  The events can be missing from
   the SEC.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Add a semaphore to the snapshot object to serialize access and
   allow each client to maintain a copy of its own snapshot object.
