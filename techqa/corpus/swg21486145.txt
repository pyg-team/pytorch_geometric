Title: IBM Installation of the Sentinel License Manager from the Modeler Client media/download produces an incorrect lock code - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing the Sentinel RMS License Manager from the Modeler Client media/download, user is not able to produce a valid licence during the licencing phase. This is due to the fact that the lock code being produced by the License Manager (LM) is: 1F-*****.

From previous experience, lock codes must always start with: 10-*; 4-*; or 100-*.
A licence code does get generated, however when starting up Modeler Client it fails with Licencing Error: 18.

Manually editing the 'echoid.dat' file does not change the 1F lock code of the LM.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please remove the current Sentinel RMS License Manager (LM) and download the latest version from the IBM Passport Advantage website here [http://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage].

Please note that you will need to be authorised by your Site/Primary contact in order to login and download IBM SPSS software and utilities.

After installing the latest version, you should now be presented with a 10-* lock code, which can generate a valid licence for your product. Please remember to restart the Sentinel LM service after a licence is generated before starting up the client application.
