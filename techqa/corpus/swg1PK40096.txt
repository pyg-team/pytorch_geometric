APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The insert cursor annoyingly warps to the beginning of the
   Description field when the focus is lost. This annoying because
   I was planning on pasting some output at the bottom of the
   window and instead it got pasted at the beginning.
   
   When entering a description I often want to copy/paste text
   so I Ctrl-Tab to the screen where I copy the text and when I go
   back to ClearQuest my cursor is located at the top of the
   description and blank lines have been removed.  Description is a
   multiline text field that is required.  The user
   expects the cursor not to move to the top of the
   field and the blank line he put at the end of the
   test to still be there.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Currently no fix
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The cursor returns to the first character position of
   multi-line
    field when the focus is lost.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  No plans to fix.
