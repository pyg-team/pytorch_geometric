APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Intelligent Management calls PMI appendCustomSetString method
   for every new URI request within 15 seconds poll interval for
   each module. This drives many frequent calls to
   appendCustomSetString and this causes hung Alarm threads and
   high CPU.
   
   The related AlarmThread is as follows:
   AlarmThreadMo W   UTLS0008W: The return of alarm thread
   "Deferrable Alarm : 0" (0000007f) to the alarm thread pool has
   been delayed for 12114 milliseconds. This may be preventing
   normal alarm function within the application server.
   The alarm listener stack trace is as follows:

   Impl.java:5474)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The code is being fixed by calling appendLockCustomSetString
   method provided by PMI.
   
   This will fix the unnecessary call to PMI appendCustomSetString.

   ****************************************************************
   Intelligent Management calls the PMI appendCustomSetString
   method for every new URI request within 15 seconds poll
   interval for each module. This drives many frequent calls to
   appendCustomSetString and this causes hang Alarm threads and
   high CPU.
   The threads are hung at the following :
   com.ibm.ws.pmi.server.PmiCollaboratorImpl.appendCustomSetString(
   PmiCollaboratorImpl.java:218)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR requires prereq APAR PI48619 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI48619].
   
   The fix removes calling "appendCustomSetString" by Intelligent
   Management to enable PMI metrics but calls new method
   "perhapsCallPmiAppendLock" exposed by PMI once to enable
   the metrics and it remains enabled.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.8.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
