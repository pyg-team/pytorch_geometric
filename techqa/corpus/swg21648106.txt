PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting Data documents aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

CAUSE
In the event of a failure during the attempted installation or upgrade of the Tivoli Storage Manager V6 Server code it will often be necessary to provide support with the corresponding installation logs so that the source of the failure can be identified. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting Troubleshooting Data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBMÂ® Support quickly determine if: 

Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery).
There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved.
There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity.
Locating root cause can speed development of a code fix.

Gathering General Information 
For supported levels of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager you can use IBM Support Assistant (ISA) to capture general information. Alternatively, you can also manually collect the general information. 

Entering general information into an electronically-opened PMR (ESR) [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html] eliminates waiting on the phone to provide general information to Level 1 support. 



Manually Gathering General Information 
The install process should create a zip file (logs.zip) containing all of the required logs in the following locations:  * Windows: the logs.zip file will be created in the specified installation directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM), 
 * UNIX/Linux: the logs.zip file can be found in the /var/tivoli/tsm directory.


Manually Gathering v6 Server Installation Information 
If the logs.zip file is not present, the following data should be manually collected and provided to support for analysis: 


Log Type Log Name UNIX/Linux Location Windows Location Install Anywhere log.txt /var/tivoli/tsm (Chosen install directory) Deployment Engine acu_de.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_cbe.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine DE_Install.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_msg.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_trace*.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_trace.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_msg.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_cbe.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Composite Offering Installer install folder /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan Composite Offering Installer inventory folder /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan DB2 tmp folder /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan DB2 logs folder /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan 
. 

Submitting Information to IBM Support 
After a PMR is open, you can submit diagnostic troubleshooting data [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21257908] to IBM. 

If using ESR [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html], update the PMR to indicate that data has been sent. 

Online Self-Help Resources 
 * Review up-to-date product information at the Tivoli Storage Manager Product Support page [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/sysmgmt/products/support/IBMTivoliStorageManager.html].
