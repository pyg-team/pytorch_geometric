PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are experiencing a Default Configuration Wizard problem with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) and would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the WebSphere Message Broker Support team can diagnose your problem. 

This MustGather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris systems.
Return to the WMB / IIB MustGather index [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. 
 2. Check for known issues: Using the Default Configuration wizard [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ae20200_.htm]
    Running the Configuration Manager Proxy API Exerciser sample [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ae33360_.htm]
    [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/tserver/support/]WebSphere Message Broker support site [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Message_Broker]
    
    
    



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. mqsidc
    See: mqsidc usage instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu46012_.htm]
     * When running the tool, select the option for 'Broker Collector', when prompted.
    
    
 2. 
 3. Message Broker API trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au20102_.htm] 
    
 4. 
 5. DefaultConfigurationWizard.log [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/be68220_.htm] Note: The configuration process is written to a log file in the Eclipse workspace directory:  * Windows: user_home_directory\eclipse\workspace\.metadata\DefaultConfigurationWizard.log
     * Linux: user_home_directory/IBM/<wmbt version>/workspace/.metadata/DefaultConfigurationWizard.log
    
    
 6. 
 7. 
 8. General Broker information
    If the mqsidc tool was not run, then capture this information manually  * Record the WebSphere Message Broker version, release, and maintenance level.
       This can be captured using the command 'mqsiservice -v'.
     * Record the operating system version, release, and maintenance level.
     * Record the version, release, and maintenance level of any related products and components for the problematic application.
     * Collect the local error log. On Window systems, the local error log is the Windows Application Event Log.
       You can find the Event Viewer from the Windows Control Panel.
       See: Event viewer logs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg21295454] 
       
       On UNIX and Linux systems, the local error log is the syslog.
       The location of your syslog is configured in the syslog daemon.
       See: Configuring the syslog daemon [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an04230_.htm]
       
       
     * Collect the Standard Output/Error logs.
       On Window systems, WMB writes information to a 'console.txt' file.
       On UNIX and Linux systems, WMB writes information to both 'stdout' and 'stderr' files.
       These files are located under the Message Broker workpath.
       See: Standard System Logs [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14165_.htm] 
    
    



ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 



STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
