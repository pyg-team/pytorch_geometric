APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Update Installer (UPDI) is designed to do lots of prereq checks
   before it really installs a maintenance package.
   One of the prereq checks is an APAR Prereq check. The
   following 2 items about mutex (mutually exclusive) APARs will
   be checked:
   #1 whether the installed APAR contains the mutex APAR for
   current selected maintenance.
   #2 whether the current selected maintenance contains the mutex
   APAR for already installed maintenances.
   
   Scnerio :
   If the installed APAR PKXXXX has a mutex APAR PKYYYY.
   When installing a Fix pack, UPDI finds that the Fixpack contains
   APAR PKYYYY which is a mutex APAR for PKXXXX.
   Although APAR PKXXXX will be uninstalled during the FP
   installation, it still exists during the prereq check period.
   So it comes out in the error  message.
   
   Currently UPDI doesn't have the ability to predict the APARS
   which are going to be uninstalled during the mutex pre-req
   checking and this APAR will resolve it.

   UPDI is designed to do mutex prereq checking before it
   really installs a maintenance package. Currently UPDI doesn't
   have the ability to predict the APARs which are going to be
   uninstalled during the mutex pre-req checking. If the
   installed APAR PKXXXX has a mutex APAR PKYYYY. When installing a
   Fix pack, UPDI finds that the Fix pack contains APAR PKYYYY
   which is a mutex APAR for PKXXXX. Although APAR PKXXXX will be
   uninstalled during the fix pack installation, it still exists
   during the prereq check period. So the UPDI prereq checking
   will fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  UPDI will be enhanced to exclude the APARS which are going to
   be uninstalled during the mutex prereq checking when applying
   a Fix Pack.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 7.0.0.19.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
