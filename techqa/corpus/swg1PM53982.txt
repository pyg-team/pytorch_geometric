APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   published a recommendation, "Transitions:  Recommendation for
   Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key
   Lengths", NIST special publication 800-131A,
   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.p [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.p]
   df, for using stronger cryptographic keys and more robust
   algorithms to protect sensitive information.
   The default encryption key lengths have been increased for
   the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)  and the Diffie-Hellman
   Algorithm (DH), to conform to the NIST recommendations.  Support
   for this NIST recommendation has also been implemented in ICSF
   FMID HCR7790 and ICSF FMID HCR7780 with APAR OA36882 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1OA36882] applied.
   **
   This new function is specific to the z/OS IBMPKCS11Impl provider
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The z/OS IBMPKCS11Impl provider may throw exceptions due to
   software cryptographic key length changes.  These exceptions
   are caused when software cryptographic provider keys are
   translated to hardware cryptographic provider keys with
   lengths greater than what is supported by installed
   cryptographic services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Beginning with IBM SDK 6.0 SR10, IBM SDK 6.0.1 SR1, and IBM
   SDK 7.0 SR1, default key lengths have been increased for the
   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and the Diffie-Hellman
   Algorithm (DH), to conform to the NIST 800-131A
   recommendations.  The default key length for DSA and DH
   where changed from 1024 to 2048.
   
   One of the exceptions that may be thrown in such a situation
   is a java.security.InvalidKeyException that includes the
   string "Invalid key spec:  Attribute value is invalid"
   
   ICSF PKCS #11 supported key lengths can be found in "z/OS
   Cryptographic Services ICSF Writing PKCS #11 Applications",
   publication SA23-2231-04.
