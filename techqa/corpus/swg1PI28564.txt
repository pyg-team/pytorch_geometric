APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using either copy option from the edit menu of a Modeler table
   node output with all the contents of the table output
   highlighted, and more than a few thousand rows of data in the
   table output, can result in only the first 350 rows being copied
   to the clipboard when working in a Modeler Server environment
   where the server has a relatively slow connection to
   the client, rather than all the rows that are selected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This is not the intended use of this functionality, in order to
   export data you should either use the data export nodes, or, if
   you want to create a file on the client machine directly, then
   you can use the file>export options from the table object
   dialog. This allows you to export to html or csv (on the client
   machine), If you want it in Excel ultimately you can then import
   the text file into Excel.
   
   The current behaviour reported in this APAR will be changed in a
   future version as follows:
   
   1. If running in local mode copying all the data in an output
   node will copy all the data.
   2. If running in server mode copying all the data will copy the
   current data window only. If the total amount of data in the
   table on the server is greater than this a warning will be
   displayed to the user indicating not all the data has been
   copied.
   
   Without this change, copying large amounts of data from the
   table output node in Modeler in a client\server environment
   could cause client hangs, out of memories, or very sluggish
   behaviour.
