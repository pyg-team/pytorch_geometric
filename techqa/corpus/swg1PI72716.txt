APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rhapsody crashed when executing 'export Diagram Image' on a
   customer's statechart.
   
   In customer's statechart, there are more than 70 graphic
   elements (states, conditions, junction connectors). If  we
   delete most of them until only around 20 element was left, then
   the diagram can be exported. But I can't find any special
   diagram element which caused this problem. If I created a simple
   statechart which include more than 30 graphic elements (states,
   conditions, junction connectors), but same problem never occurs.
   Hence, It can be only reproduced on customer's model.
   
   [Reproduce steps]
   1) open customer's model
   2) execute 'export Diagram Image' on a customer's statechart.
   3) rhapsody crash

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem in the diagram can be solved by going to the browser
   and delete the following elements:
   - Under the "condition_105", delete the "default of
   condition_105" from the incoming transtions
   - Delete the "terminationconnector_161"
   This can be done by the user.
