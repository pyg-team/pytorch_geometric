ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  V5R14SP02 BOM Installation problem
   Hello Dassault,
   'Help about' in BOM Editor shows 'V5R13 Service
   Pack 7', after having
   installed SmarTeam V5R14SP02.
   Relaunch of V5R14SP02 installation showed only
   SmarTeam Editor installed
   on this machine.
   Scenario:
   1. Set up a new machine with Windows XP SP1
   2. Install SmarTeam V5R14 Editor Standalone as
   described in the
   Installation Guide
   3. launch Editor and check 'Help about'
   --> it says 'V5R14 Service Pack 1'
   see st_v5r14ga_editor_inst_help_about.bmp
   4. run regedt32 from a DOS box
   --> you will see, that SmarTeam Editor V5R13SP6
   Build Number 74 is
   installed
   see st_v5r14ga_editor_reg_entry_2.bmp
   5. Install BOM package V5R14
   see st_v5r14ga_bom_inst.bmp
   6. launch BOM editor and check 'Help about'
   --> it says 'V5R14 Service Pack 1'
   see st_v5r14ga_bom_inst_help_about.bmp
   7. Start V5R14SP02 installation
   when installing from CD, the same problems were
   encountered as
   already reported with PMR 49241,660,706 for
   SmarTeam Editor.
   When the Service Pack for BOM is installed, it says
   is installing
   V5R13SP07
   8. launch BOM Editor and check 'Help about'
   --> it shows 'V5R13 Service Pack 7'
   see st_v5r14sp2_bom_help_about.bmp
   9. run regedt32 from a DOS box
   --> you will see now, that SmarTeam Editor
   V5R13SP7 Build Number 24
   and SmarTeam BOM V5R13 Service Pack 7 are
   registered
   see st_v5r14sp2_reg_entry.bmp
   10. Start V5R14SP02 installation again and you will
   see, that only
   SmarTeam will get updated
   see st_v5r14sp2_relaunch.bmp
   At this stage it is impossible to remove BOM from
   this installation. You
   have to reinstall before you can remove it.
   Even I do not know, what the patch on CD2 is for
   (I could not find
   any reference in the documentation nor in the
   program directory), I
   installed it on top of the V5R14GA code.
   Installation of V5R14SP02 was abended, when the
   BOM part was going to be
   installed.
