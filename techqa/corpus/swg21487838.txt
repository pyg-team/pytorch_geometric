 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error Message: The process terminated with the error code -3.
I installed Collaboration & Deployment Services (aka C&DS) 4.0 and SPSS Statistics Server 18.0.2 and the adapters for SPSS Statistics. 
When I run a job containing a trivial syntax step (e.g. : show licenses. ), the job fails with the following log.

--- PRMS ---
The process terminated with the error code -3.
Remote PASW Statistics Server failed to execute syntax job.
--- STDOUT ---
--- STDERR ---


Why do we get this error and how can we resolve this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue is fixed in PASW SPSS Statistics Server 18.0.3 patch
