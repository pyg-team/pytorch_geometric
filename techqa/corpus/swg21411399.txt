Title: IBM Applying an upgrade to the monitoring servers of Global Monitor - United States

Text:
RN7.1.1 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you have deployed ClearCase 7.1 or a later version with Global Monitor and want to upgrade to the latest version, IBM Installation Manager can upgrade the ClearCase servers, ClearCase clients, and Global Monitor agents on your ClearCase hosts. However, upgrading Global Monitor's monitoring servers or bundled Tivoli agents is not especially intuitive. 

SYMPTOM
MultiSite Global Monitor is already deployed and is being upgraded to a higher version.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Bundled software products are not updated in the ClearCase releases and fix packs. ClearCase MultiSite includes 

 * IBM DB2 Enterprise Edition 9.1, and 
 * IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.2 FixPack 1 (6.2.0.1)


in 7.1, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and subsequent patch releases. The artifacts that require an update are the Global Monitor support files for Tivoli components. 
These are the steps to upgrade by Tivoli component. 

 * Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) client
   There are two components that need to be upgraded on the TEP client host - one is the Global Monitor support file, and the other is the Global Monitor Language Pack. (The Global Monitor language pack is an optional-install product to provide a localized user interface.) To upgrade the Global Monitor support file, 
   
    * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Navigate to the KRCSupport\WINDOWS\ folder and execute setup.exe 
    * Follow the upgrade wizard by choosing default options. You don't have to change the Selected Features panel, either. If you upgrade support files on the TEMS host, please check 'Monitoring Agent for Rational ClearCase' at the Agent Deployment panel
   
   
   To upgrade the Global Monitor Language Pack,  * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Navigate to the KRCLangPack\ folder and execute setup.exe 
    * Follow the upgrade wizard by choosing default options.
   
   
 * Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
   There are two components that need to be upgraded on the TEPS host - one is the Global Monitor support file and the other is the Global Monitor Language Pack. (The Global Monitor language pack is an optional-install product to provide a localized user interface.) If you install the TEP client and the TEPS on single host, you don't have to repeat these upgrade steps. There is no need to apply a fix or an upgrade for the TEPS database to make it work with a version of Global Monitor. To upgrade the Global Monitor support file, 
   
    * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Navigate to the KRCSupport\WINDOWS\ folder and execute setup.exe 
    * Follow the upgrade wizard by choosing default options. You don't have to change the Selected Features panel, either. If you upgrade support files on the TEMS host, please check 'Monitoring Agent for Rational ClearCase' at the Agent Deployment panel
   
   
   To upgrade the Global Monitor Language Pack,  * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Navigate to the KRCLangPack\ folder and execute setup.exe 
    * Follow the upgrade wizard by choosing default options.
   
   
 * Hub or Remote Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)
   There are two components that need to be upgraded on the TEMS host - one is the Global Monitor support file and the other is the Global Monitor bundle in the remote depot. If you install the TEP client or the TEPS as well as the TEMS on single host, you don't have to repeat the Global Monitor support file upgrade step. You have to upgrade Global Monitor support files on all remote TEMS hosts as well as the hub TEMS host. To upgrade the Global Monitor support file, 
   
    * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Navigate to the KRCSupport\WINDOWS\ folder and execute setup.exe 
    * Follow the upgrade wizard by choosing default options. You don't have to change the Selected Features panel, either. If you upgrade support files on the TEMS host, please check 'Monitoring Agent for Rational ClearCase' at the Agent Deployment panel
   
   
   To add the Global Monitor bundle to the TEMS Depot  * Locate the ClearCase MultiSite DVD labeled 'IBM ClearCase-GMON KRC Agent ', or download and extract 'global_monitor.zip' from the Fix Pack web site. 
    * Open a command prompt and follow Instruction Step 5 from this on-line help:

 * Windows/Linux/Unix Operating System agent
   There is nothing to upgrade for the Operating System agent. The existing OS agent installed by previous release can work with your Global Monitor deployment. 
 * Warehouse Proxy agent
   There is nothing to upgrade for the Warehouse Proxy agent. The existing Warehouse Proxy agent installed by previous release can work with your Global Monitor deployment. 
 * Summarization and Pruning agent
   There is nothing to upgrade for the Summarization and Pruning agent. The existing Summarization and Pruning agent installed by previous release can work with your Global Monitor deployment. 
 * Tivoli Data Warehouse
   There is no need to apply a fix or an upgrade for the database software used by the Tivoli Data Warehouse, to make it work with your Global Monitor deployment. Consult with your database vender to see if there are any updates.


ClearCase servers and Global Monitor agents do not have to be upgraded all at once. The higher version of Global Monitor support files on Tivoli monitoring servers can monitor equal or lower version of Global Monitor agents. For example, Tivoli monitoring servers with Global Monitor 7.1.1 support files can monitor all 7.1, 7.1.0.2 and 7.1.1 Global Monitor agents. You have to upgrade Global Monitor support on the TEP, the TEPS, and the TEMS server before you upgrade Global Monitor agents on ClearCase hosts. Once Global Monitor support is installed, you can upgrade ClearCase hosts one by one. It is not supported to connect a higher version agent to a monitoring server with older support files.
