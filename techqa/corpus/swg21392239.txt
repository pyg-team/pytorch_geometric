Title: IBM Using backslash path separators is not supported for Websphere DataPower SOA Appliance and can cause unpredictable results - United States

Text:
backslash; back-slash; path; separator TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The use of the backslash path separator "\"is not supported for the IBM Websphere DataPower SOA Appliance and can cause unpredictable results. 

SYMPTOM
When using backslash path separators in XML, XSLT, WSDL, XSD, or other files that are being used by an IBM Websphere DataPower SOA Appliance configuration, unpredictable problems may occur when the appliance attempts to process or reference the unsupported backslash path location.

Following is an example scenario where this issue has been observed. When exporting a domain configuration with a " .\" path separator used within a referenced schema file, the resulting export package may have problems during a subsequent import. This may result in the following: 

 * An error is seen in the subsequent Import Configuration results. 
 * System log may show the following error: 
   
   Import: Filesystem full
   
   
 * System log may show the following error: 
   
   File Import error
   


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the files that are being used for the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance configuration and verify that the unsupported backslash path separator "\" is not being used.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
By replacing the unsupported backslash "\" path separators with the proper forward-slash "/" path separators, the backslash path separator problems may be resolved.
