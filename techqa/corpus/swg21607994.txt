Title: IBM Error messages on the GX7 appliance after upgrading to firmware 4.5 - United States

Text:
ERROR; info; GX7; GX7000; 4.5; firmware TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users may see multiple errors in /var/log/messages on the GX7 network IPS after moving to firmware 4.5. 

SYMPTOM
The following messages may be displayed: 

[INFO]CRM: FIPS mode was already enabled.
[ERROR]Apply policy command failed
[ERROR]Queue connect command failed
[ERROR]CtrlSocket sendto() error. Connection refused.
[ERROR]Could not send policy to iss-ppd.
[ERROR]Stop packet processing command failed
[ERROR]Start packet processing command failed
[ERROR] CRM Processes - Internal process failure detected


CAUSE
The network IPS firmware version 4.5 on the GX7 includes an update to the power PC that controls the carrier board components.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The update to the power PC along with other updates, causes the upgrade on the GX7 to take longer than usual. This longer upgrade delays the watchdog process. The delayed watchdog process causes the error messages. 


These messages will go away after the GX7 completes the upgrade.
