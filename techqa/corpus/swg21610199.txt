PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to log into Tivoli Integrated Portal, users receive an error "Error 500", followed by "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.ibm.isc.api.argus.ArgusUtil" 

SYMPTOM
The customer had recently made some security related changes in the Websphere Administrative Console


CAUSE
In the WAS Admin Console, the customer had the Global security > External authorization providers > Authorization Provider drop-down option set to "Built-in Authorization". The correct option is "External JACC provider" which is required to correctly use the Argus authorization component in TIP.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The page error will show:
"Error 500", followed by "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.ibm.isc.api.argus.ArgusUtil". The <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/systemOut.log will show similar errors to the following at the time the issue occurs:

"SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception created in one of the service methods of
the servlet action in application isc. Exception created :
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class
com.ibm.isc.api.argus.ArgusUtil"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
