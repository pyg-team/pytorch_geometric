Title: IBM SPSS C&DS cannot export model to an xml file. - United States

Text:
script export model xml pmml AEQMJ0249E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In our streams we are using scripts to export models in xml format. We are able to run this streams in SPSS Modeler, but when adding the streams into a Collaboration & Deployment Services job and execute the job this fails with below error:

------------------------------------------------

AEQMJ0249E: Failed to execute 'export model ˆDrug as model_export format pmml'
AEQMJ0249E: Failed to execute 'export model ˆDrug as model_export format pmml'

------------------------------------------------


ENVIRONMENT
SPSS Modeler Server 16.0
SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 6.0 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Example of script used in a Modeler stream:
---------------------
execute 'Drug':c50
var model_export
set model_export = '$P-ExportPath'><'Testing.xml'
export model ^Drug as ^model_export format pmml
------------------------



The $P-ExportPath has been defined in the "Parameters" tab 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To have the C&DS job, containing a stream with a script that exports a model as an xml file, running successfully you will need to do the steps below. 

When your C&DS server is installed on a Windows platform: 

----------------- 

Open the job that contains the stream 

In the "parameter" tab specify the path using an additional backslash as escape sequence

e.g.: When your model needs to exported to: 

\\your_server\your_directory 

the value that you need to enter is:
\\\\your_server\\your_directory\\ 

-------------------- 

Note that if you didn't add the 2 last backslashes the job will run successfully but the file will be found into \\your_server and called your_directoryfilename. 

 

When your C&DS server is installed on Unix /Linux platform: 

-----------------------
When the model needs to be exported to 
e.g.: /opt/dir/dir 

the value in the 'parameter' tab will need to be
/opt/dir/dir/ 

---------------------- 

Attached stream 'druglearn with script.str' provides an example of 

- script used 

- export path parameter 

 

Note: 

In the C&DS job the export path parameter can be set to any path as long the above rules are used. 

If in the 'parameter' tab of the C&DS job no value is specified the job will run successful and the file will be created into the default directory of the application server used by C&DS. 

The user that executes the C&DS job will need to have sufficient permissions to the directory specified in the parameter value.
