Title: IBM Imaging SPSS applications and licensing - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am installing my SPSS application using a site license. Since all of the machines in our organization were built from the same image, I can see that they all share the same lock code. In this case, can I distribute the image with the application already licensed so I don't have to license each individual machine? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS has implemented new licensing technology that makes it easier for your organization to be in compliance with your license. You have the right to distribute your software however you see fit, including imaging (ghosting). If you choose to image the software and do not wish to license each machine individually, we recommend the following to make it easier to be in compliance with your license:

1. Push the spssactivator.exe/licenseactivator.exe command line to each machine. Please refer to Resolution 56400 for further details for windows or Resolution 74761 for MAC using spssactivator.jar.

2. Purchase a network license. This license entails configuring a license manager to monitor concurrent usage of the software. No licensing is necessary at the client end.

If you ghost the software and do not use one of the two suggested methods above, it will be more difficult to remain in compliance with your license using the technology provided by SPSS. In these cases, we ask that you provide SPSS with your plans to remain in compliance with your license. Also, please be aware that in these cases SPSS has the right to audit your organization to ensure compliance
