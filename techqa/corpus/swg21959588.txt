ANSWER
 

Import the certification file into the agent by doing the following command:

Note : You can use either .cer or .pem. 
Make sure the file is in ASCII not binary. 
Where the /usr/ITM/JRE is your Java location and <fileName> is your file name.

ex: 
/usr/ITM/JRE/aix526/jre/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias 
ligitalsso -keystore /usr/ITM/JRE/aix526/jre/bin/lib/security/cacerts 
-storepass <fileName> -file /NEWSSL-sscert.cer
