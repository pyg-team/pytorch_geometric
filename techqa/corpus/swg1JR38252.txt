ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Preface:
   
   1. In the left navigation pane you have the option to select
      "List View" for the modules "catalogs", "hierarchies" and
      "organizations" when opening the context menu with the
      right mouse click.
   
   2. The idea behind the "List View" is to enable users to show
      a summary of the module's content that can be navigated in.
   
      Example catalog: Imagine a category containing many hundred
      items. In the regular left navigation pane you would see
      the first 100 items but would not be able to navigate to
      item number 101 in the left navigation pane.
   
      The "List View" allows you to see a limited number of items
      only - but you have the opportunity to navigate within all
      items in this specific category.
   
   3. Known limitation: the context menu for items and users the
      context menu is disabled.
   
      a) In a catalog you cannot check out an item to a
         collaboration area when using the "List View".
   
      b) In a catalog you cannot cut, copy, remove or delete an
         item via the context menu when using the "List View".
   
      c) In a organization you cannot cut, copy or remove users
         via the context menu when using the "List View".
   
   Current situation:
      The Information center does not mention the existence of
      the "List View" feature nor its intention as well as its
      limitation.
   
   
   Desired situation:
      The Information Center should mention the existence of the
      "List View" feature as well well as its intention and
      limitation.
