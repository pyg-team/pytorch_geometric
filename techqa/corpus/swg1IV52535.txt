APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is inconsistency in the historical data collection for the
   attribute group KVM VM DATASTORE UTILIZAITON. In this attribute
   group,
   all the virtual machines listed under the column
   Virtual_Machine are not
   considered for summarization and results in missing data in
   agent
   reports. This is the issue with the design consideration
   followed to
   define primary keys for attribute group table
   KVM_VM_DATASTORE_UTILIZATION.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There is inconsistency in the historical data collection for the
   attribute group KVM VM DATASTORE UTILIZAITON. In this attribute
   group, all the virtual machines listed under the column
   Virtual_Machine are not considered for summarization and results
   in missing data in agent
   reports. This is the issue with the design consideration
   followed to define primary keys for attribute group table
   KVM_VM_DATASTORE_UTILIZATION.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There was inconsistent design consideration for a primary key
   causing the historical data for the table
   KVM_VM_DATASTORE_UTILIZATION not being consistently summarized
   in summary table KVM_VM_DATASTORE_UTILIZATION_D. Hence added a
   unique identifier in the attribute group
   VM_Datastore_Utilization.
