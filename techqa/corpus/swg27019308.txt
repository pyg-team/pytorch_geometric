 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document summarizes the hardware, platforms, and software supported by IBM InfoSphere Optim Application Repository Analyzer 5.1. 

CONTENT


HARDWARE CONSIDERATIONS
The following are minimum requirements. Actual hardware capacity for acceptable performance depends on many factors, including but not limited to data volume, service level agreement, and access to nonrelational data, as well as the number of open dialogs, number of database tables that are active, and memory demands from other active applications and services. 

The PC on which Application Repository Analyzer is to be installed should have the following:

 * 1 GB RAM
 * 40 MB disk space for the Application Repository Analyzer software
 * The appropriate client connectivity software (e.g., Oracle Net 9) for connection to the Application Repository Analyzer repository database and the Enterprise Application database

A database connection will be required for each database with which Application Repository Analyzer needs to communicate. This will normally be two connections for each Enterprise Application to be reverse-engineered:

 * One for the Application Repository Analyzer repository
 * One for the source Enterprise Application database

Application Repository Analyzer uses Microsoft® ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to communicate with databases. (Note: this does not apply to the SQLite database type).


PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS
Application Repository Analyzer supports the following operating systems:

 * Windows 95/98
 * Windows 2000
 * Windows 2003
 * Windows 2008
 * Windows NT 3.5x, 4
 * Windows XP
 * Windows Vista


DATABASE CONSIDERATIONS
Application Repository Analyzer supports the following databases:

 * Oracle version 8 or greater
 * IBM DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows version 8 or greater
 * Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or greater
 * Sybase SQL Anywhere 8.0 or greater


SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS
The ADO technology is part of the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). It is recommended that MDAC 2.8 or higher is installed on each PC where Application Repository Analyzer is to be installed. The table below shows the recommended ADO Providers and versions that are required for each of the RDBMS types Application Repository Analyzer supports.

OPTIM DESIGNER
Application Repository Analyzer provides a pre-built integration to export data models in a format that Optim designer can consume. Optim designer is a component of Optim solutions for supported enterprise applications, for example, the Optim Data Growth Solution for PeopleSoft Enterprise. Optim designer allows you to create, import, and modify data models, define data privacy policies and Optim interoperability request models. You can use Optim designer to run Optim and Optim z/OS® requests. You can also use Optim designer to create and test your data management services.

To use the data model exports from Application Repository Analyzer, you must have Optim designer installed along with the other Optim components. For detailed information on installing and using Optim designer, see the IBM Optim Designer User Guide, online help, and tutorials.


SUPPORTED ENTERPRISE APPLICATION VERSIONS
Application Repository Analyzer supports the following enterprise applications:

 * PeopleSoft Enterprise version 8 and above
 * JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Xe and above
 * Siebel version 6.5 and above
 * Oracle E-Business Suite version 11 and above
