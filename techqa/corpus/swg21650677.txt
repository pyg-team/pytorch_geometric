Title: IBM Unable to connect to DB2, missing libpam - United States

Text:
pam; library; libpam.so.1.0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installation, ncp_model fails to start. After checking database connectivity using ncp_db_access.pl the following error is received. 

SYMPTOM
install_driver(DB2) failed: Can't load '/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux-thread-multi/auto/DBD/DB2/DB2.so' for module DBD::DB2: libpam.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory at /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/perl/lib/5.8.8/i686-linux-thread-multi/DynaLoader.pm line 230.
at (eval 2) line 3
Compilation failed in require at (eval 2) line 3.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Run ncp_db_access.pl against your ITNM discovery domain. For example, if your ITNM domain name is NCOMS: 

cd $NCHOME 

source env.sh 

ncp_perl precision/scripts/perl/scripts/ncp_db_access.pl -domain NCOMS 

The script constructs a datasource from the configuration in $NCHOME/etc/precision/DbLogins.NCOMS.cfg 

If the result of the attempt to connect includes failures to open shared object file libpam.so.0 then either the library is not in your $PATH or it is not installed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Installing the 32 bit version of the library will resolve the error.
