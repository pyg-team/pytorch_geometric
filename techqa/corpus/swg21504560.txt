PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Opening IBM Rational Functional Tester (RFT) results in the Script Explorer and the Functional Test Projects section showing multiple "Unable to Create the View" errors. 

SYMPTOM
The Script Explorer shows the error:

Could not create the view: com.rational.test.ft.wswplugin.rational_ide (Initialization failure) 

The Functional Test Projects tab shows the error: 

 

Could not create the view: An unexpected exception was thrown" followed by "com.rational.test.ft.sys.Mutex$Invalid$MutexEception". 

 

An error appears in a pop-up which states: 

 

An error has occurred. See error log for more details. com.rational.test.ft.wswplugin.rational_ide (initialization failure)

CAUSE
This issue can occur when RFT is using a floating license server and does not have the Rational License Key Administrator (LKAD) installed on the system.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When using RFT 8.2 and higher with a Floating License, you must have the following configuration: 

 * IBM Rational License Key Server 8.1.1 or higher (on the server system) 
 * IBM Rational Functional Tester 8.2 or higher 
 * IBM Rational License Key Administrator with a version matching the License Key Server (on the RFT system)


After installing LKAD on the RFT system you will need to configure LKAD to point to the IBM Rational License Key Server (see: Use License Key Administrator (LKAD) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rational/v0r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.license.doc/topics/t_open_lkad.html] for information on how to do this). After setting up LKAD, you should no longer see the errors in RFT.
