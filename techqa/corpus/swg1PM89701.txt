APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RT changes include definition of whether specification or
   implementation depending on existence of component file.
   
   Scenario 1:
   When component is RO(read only) and write include statement in
   cpp file, RT adds the header information to ImpIncludes
   property.
   Also when write include statement in .h file, RT adds it to
   SpecIncludes property, as mentioned online help..
   
   However, when component file(header file) is already existing as
   RO(read only), RT adds include information to only SpecIncludes
   property, though write the statement in cpp file.
   
   Scenario 2:
   When write include statement in cpp file (component is not RO),
   normally RT adds a dependency under .cpp SourceArtifact with
   usage 'Implementation'
   Also when write include statement in .h file, RT adds the
   dependency with usage 'Specification'
   
   However, when componentfile(header file) is already existing, RT
   adds a dependency with usage 'Specification', though write the
   statement in cpp file.
