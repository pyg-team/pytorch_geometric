APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "reauthentication" login form that is presented in DASH
   when the LTPA token expires does not allow the loginID field to
   be edited.  If the loginID contains a backslash, the backslash
   is missing in the loginID field in the form and therefore will
   fail to reauthenticate the user because the loginID in the form
   is not valid.
