Title: IBM Another version of this product is already installed. Installation of this version cannot continue. - United States

Add-On Module; Add-On; Add; On; Module; Another version of this product is already installed. Installation of this version cannot continue. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I purchased an addition module for Statistics.
I went out to the IBM Software and Download Portal, search for and downloaded the additional module software.
When I click on installation software to install it on my computer I received the following message:

"Another version of this product is already installed. Installation of this version cannot continue. To configure or remove the existing version of this product, use Add/Remove Programs on the Control Panel." 

CAUSE
You cannot install the same version of software on top of itself.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you purchase a Statistics Add-On Module license, there is no additional software needed to install.


 You will need to activate your add-on module license locally or on the license manger, depending on the license type. An "Authorized User" license gets activated locally by running the "License Authorization Wizard". A "Concurrent User" license needs to be activated on the computer where the license manger resides.
