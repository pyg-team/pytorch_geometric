Text:
ORA-29885; Maximum String Length TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Content Engine modifying property definition string length results in Oracle ORA-29885 error. 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to modify a property definition's maximum string length value in FileNet Enterprise Manager may result in an error message: 

An error occurred accessing the database. Error code: 29,885, Message: 'ORA-29885:domain index is defined on the column to be modified.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An Oracle database index is defined on the column which corresponds to the property template that is being modified in FileNet Enterprise Manager. Remove the index via database tools or if the Set/Remove index option is available, via FileNet Enterprise Manager. The Maximum String Length may then be changed and the database index may be rebuilt.
