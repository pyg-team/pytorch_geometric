APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.0 and adding remote access for MQ
   Administrators, the following 2 runmqsc commands were issued:
   .
   SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody','*MQADMIN')
   SET CHLAUTH(SYSTEM.ADMIN.*) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody')
   .
   They are described in this technote:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137]
   WMQ 7.1 / 7.5 queue manager RC 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED or
   AMQ4036 when using client connection as an MQ Administrator
   .
   The output of the dmpmqcfg command shows the following stanza
   for the first of the newly added channel authentication records:
   + begin
   SET CHLAUTH('*') +
      TYPE(BLOCKUSER) +
      USERLIST('nobody' +
              ,'*MQADMIN') +
   * ALTDATE(2014-07-24) +
   * ALTTIME(10.36.23) +
      ACTION(REPLACE)
   (blank)
   * Unknown Selector 1021(205) +
   ACTION(REPLACE)
   + end

LOCAL FIX
 *  Removing this text from the dmpmqcfg output will make it usable:
   
    * Unknown Selector 1021(205) +
      ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   This text is returned when there are no protection policies
   defined on the queue manager and so can be safely removed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of dmpmqcfg who do not have any security policies defined
   are affected by this issue
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The dmpmqcfg utility will send an inquire policy command to the
   queue manager in order to ask for information about policy
   objects. If no policy objects are defined in the queue manager,
   then the following is printed by the dmpmqcfg command:
   
    * Unknown Selector 1021(205) +
      ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   This problem is caused when the queue manager sends back a PCF
   message that the dmpmqcfg utility does not understand and the
   dmpmqcfg command then tries to display it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified so that the dmpmqcfg utility ignores the
   "no protection policies found" response from the queue manager
   rather than try and display it.
