ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   ---------
   Code coverage report incorrectly reports that a transition is
   not covered
   
   
   Description:
   ------------
   Email Ref from Christian:
   1. There are some bugs regarding coverage of transitions.
   Currently the
   animation notification for a behavioral step
   (notifyBehaviorStep) does
   not contain information about the instance doing the step and TC
   has to
   estimate which instance is doing the step to compute the
   coverage. If
   there are SendActions in the statechart or if events are sent
   from the
   entry or exit action of states (which is the case in this model)
   then
   sometimes TC doesn't get the correct instance.
   To fix this the notifyBehaviorStep has to include the instance
   doing the
   step (this was just implemented by IBM in the latest 7.5.1
   prototype)
   and we have to do some changes in TC to use this information. I
   expect
   this bug is fixed with the 7.5.1 beta.
