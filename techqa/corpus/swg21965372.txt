QUESTION
 When searching for "EDITION" in IBM eDiscovery Manager (eDM) and expects multi-lingual terms such as 'PROFESSIONAL利便EDITION' to highlight the 'EDITION' part of the word. Why the 'EDITION' could not be highlighted? 

ANSWER
eDM highlight code only highlights if the word "EDITION" is by itself. That is, it can't be a sub string of a larger word, even if the larger word has multi-lingual characters (or any other non-space characters).

Highlighting works as follows: 

 * A word is highlighted ONLY if it matches the search term. It can't be a sub string in a larger word (even if the sub string is separated by multi-lingual or non-alphanumeric characters) 
 * Wildcards are highlighted. If the search term is forward*, then words such as forwarding and orwarded are highlighted. 
 * Stem words are not highlighted. If the search term is forward and stemming is enabled (only applies to CONTENT), then words such as forwarding and forwarded are NOT highlighted.
