ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Rose(TM) 2003.06.00 and 2003.06.12 when generating
   code for a Corba class under a nested package, Rose produces
   both classes in the code.
   
   Below are the steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Open Rose and set the languague to Corba
   a. Go to Tools / Options / Notations
   b. Change the default languague to be Corba
   
   2. Create a package called Testing under the logical view and
   stereotype that as CORBAModule
   a. Right click on the Logical View and select New Package
   b. Right click on the new package and select Open Specification
   c. Change the Stereotype to be a CORBAModule
   
   3. Create 2 packages a and b under the Testing package and
   stereotype type as CORBAModule
   a. Right click on teh Testing package and select New Package
   b. Open the specification of the package and name the package a
   c. Right click on the new package and select Open Specification
   d. Change the Stereotype to be a CORBAModule
   Do the same for package b
   
   4. Create 2 classes with the same name, one under package a and
   the other under package b, stereotype one as a CORBAStruct and
   the other as a CORBATypedef
   a. Right click on package a and select New / Class
   b. Right click on the class and open the specification
   c. Name the class Test and set the stereotype to CORBATypedef
   d. Right click on package b and select New / Class
   e. Right click on the class and open the specification
   f. Name the class Test and set the stereotype to CORBAStruct
   
   Note: A warning message will be displayed, but just click okay.
   
   5.Create two components and assign each class to a component
   a. Right click on the Component View and select New / Component
   b. Name the first component a
   c. Name the second component b
   d. Right click on the component a and open the
   standard specification and go to the Realizes tab
   e. Right click on the test class in package a and select assign
   f. Click Apply and ok
   g. Right click on the component b and open the standard
   specification and go to the Realizes tab
   h. Right click on the test class in package b and select assign
   i. Click Apply and ok
   
   6. Now generate code for the test class under package b
   a. Right click on the test class in package b
   b. Select the Corba / Generate Code
   
   7. Browse the code for this class and you will see the code for
   class test in package a
   a. Right click on the test class in package a and select Browse
   code
   b. Below is the code that gets generated:
   //Source file: C:/test/b.idl
   #ifndef __B_DEFINED
   #define __B_DEFINED
   
   /* CmIdentification
     %X% %Q% %Z% %W% */
   
   module x {
   
    module b {
   
     struct test {
     };
   
    };
   
    module a {
   
     typedef  test;
   
    };
   
   };
   
   #endif
