APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Performing an installation of the Admin Center as a non-root
   user may result in the Deployment Engine (DE) being installed in
   the non-root user's home directory, if a global DE does not
   already exist.  The subsequent installation of a product
   requiring the DE (eg. Reporting and Monitoring) will create a
   second, global DE (eg. in the /usr/ibm/common/acsi directory).
   Once the global DE has been created, all subsequent
   installations/upgrades will attempt to use the global DE and
   won't look for existing entries in the original, local DE.  This
   can result in installation failures when attempting to upgrade
   the Admin Center due to the fact that the product is already
   installed.
   
   Platforms affected:
   6.1.x and 6.2.x versions of Admin Center
   
   Additional Keywords:
   administration install isc tip tivoli storage manager tsm
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually uninstall the Admin Center prior to performing the
   upgrade.
