APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After installing ITCAM ITCAM AD the following messages show up
   in the z/OS joblog:
   ICH408I USER(xxxxxxxx) GROUP(xxxxxx) NAME(WAS SERVANT REGION  )
   562
   /root/etc/ibm CL(DIRACC  ) FID(00000001000000010000000000000000)
   INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO MKDIR
   ACCESS INTENT(-W-)  ACCESS ALLOWED(OTHER      R-X)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There needs to be a setting when the servant first starts up to
   avoid trying to create files in <SYSTEM>/etc.
   
   Check the servant genericJvmArguments in server.xml or
   via the
   WAS Admin Console and make sure that the following settings are
   included:
   
   -Djlog.propertyFileDir.CYN=/ctl/tcw/I1_V71/I11/runtime/was70.I11
   .AppServerName
   -Djlog.common.dir.CYN=/ctl/tcw/I1_V71/I11/runtime/was70.I11.AppS
   erverName
   -Dibm.common.log.dir=/ctl/tcw/I1_V71/I11/runtime/was70.I11.AppSe
   rverName/logs
   
   If these are not already there, as a workaround, please add them
   to the genericJvjArugments and recycle the servant.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On startup ITCAM for AD 7.1 DC JFLT logging attempts to create a
   directory for default jlog properties in the system /etc
   directory (/etc/ibm/tivoli/common/cfg). If the servant user ID
   does not have write access to the /etc directory a permission
   error is issued (e.g. RACF ICH408I message).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ITCAM AD conmfiguration and maintenance upgrade now defines a
   property jlog.common.dir.CYN  in java.dc.properties so that
   JLog will not create a default jlog.properties file in /etc
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
