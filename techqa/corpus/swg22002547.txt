QUESTION
 How do customers of Daeja ViewONE within IBM Content Navigator get access to Daeja updates?

ANSWER
Customers with direct entitlement to Standalone IBM Daeja ViewONE 


IBM Daeja ViewONE product updates are available via FixCentral [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]. Customers with direct entitlement to Daeja can independently access those packages and proceed with in place upgrades.

In place upgrade of the Daeja ViewONE product is not recommended to V.R.M. releases[1]. It should be limited to iFixes and FPs of the Daeja ViewONE product.

[https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] Customers without direct entitlement to Daeja can not independently access those packages.

The Daeja updates package they need might be available via an existing or upcoming Content Navigator update.
