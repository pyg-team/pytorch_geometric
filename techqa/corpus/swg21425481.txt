PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error that can occur when trying to install CCRC on 64 bit Red Hat client. 

SYMPTOM
 

On a RedHat 5.3 64 bit machine if you try to install CCRC client software but you get the following error:


The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag.


CAUSE
ClearCase and CCRC are 32 bit applications. Even on a 64 bit machine, you need to install 32 bit libraries for the install. 


ENVIRONMENT
64 bit Linux Red Hat machine, trying to install CCRC or ClearCase using the gui.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The installer is unable to run in graphical mode.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This is a supported configuration. However, CCRC requires the 32 bit libraries for the install.

Platforms that support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications require both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the following packages: 

o compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-61 

o compat-db-4.2.52-5.1 

o libXp-1.0.0-8
