APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the JBOSS server is restarted while the Event Server is
   running, new JMS messages placed on the JMS queue after the
   JBOSS restart, are not picked up by the Event Server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  LOCAL FIX:
   WTXCQ - WTX00025343
   TR / TR
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The JMS adapter's listener can now seamlessly reconnect to the
   JMS server after it has been recycled.  Before this fix, the WTX
   adapter could not automatically determine whether or not the
   JBOSS JMS server was up and running or not.   As a result, JMS
   messages would go unprocessed until the WTX launcher was itself
   recycled.
