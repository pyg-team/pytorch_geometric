APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user has created a new architecture virtual system pattern
   using the Pattern Builder that contains multiple components.
   They want to access the pattern attributes during deployment.
   
   The attributes are not displayed during deployment.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To show missing component attributes for configuration, lock any
   one of the attributes, such as the name attribute. This action
   causes the other component attributes to be displayed for
   configuration.
   
   This is an issue described in the PureApplication System version
   2.0.0.1 release notes.  The release note can be found at the
   following link:

   t=SSM8NY+SSPQ5Q [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044407&context=SSM8NY+SSPQ5Q]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code reference to "locked" attributes when none exist in the
   pattern throws an exception and prevents the pattern attributes
   from being displayed during deployment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.0.0.1 interim fix 1, and higher versions, that prevents the
   exception when locked attributes do not exist in the pattern.
