APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On a SOAPInput node it is possible to provide a messageSet to
   validate against. This can be a specific messageSet, a Shared
   Library reference or left blank to validate against Application
   level
   resources.
   
   If validation is turned off in the SOAPInput node and a Validate
   node is used to perform validation then it is possible that a
   BIP5057 will be encountered.  This will only occur if a specific
   messageSet is named or a Shared Library reference is used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem can be worked around by not using a validate node
   and validating directly in the SOAPInput node.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM Integration Bus v10.0 validating a SOAPInput node's
   message with a separate Validate node, if a specific messageSet
   is named or a Shared Library reference is used.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a SOAPInput node references a Shared Library as the
   messageSet and a separate Validate node is used to validate the
   message it throws a BIP5057 exception reporting the messageSet
   is blank, because the SOAP Root parser does not look up the
   current messageSet in use.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SOAP Root parser's behaviour has been corrected.
