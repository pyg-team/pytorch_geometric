ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer attempts to define a cyclic period based on work days
   (on panel eqqtmrpl). He is able to define the period
   succesfully. However, when he attempts to print a report of
   the periods that he has defined the report never finishes (it
   appears that it is in a loop. Examining the printout one sees
   that the origin date is incorrect.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:   Field SHIFT was not initialized       *
   *                        to zero right before EQQXT48X         *
   *                        was called.  EQQXT48X gets the        *

   *                        periods.  Since SHIFT had garbage     *
   *                        in it and was used for arithmetic     *
   *                        operations, it produced bad data      *
   *                        in the print report and the program   *
   *                        went into an endless loop.            *
   *                        This only happens when the FIRST      *
   *                        WORKCYCLIC PERIOD to be printed       *
   *                        has an ORIGIN DATE of today or        *
   *                        later, not earlier.  If the first     *
   *                        WORKCYCLIC period has an ORIGIN       *
   *                        DATE that's earlier than today's      *
   *                        date, then the program will end       *
   *                        normally and the report will          *
   *                        contain the proper data.              *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Field SHIFT needs to be initialized to zero before EQQXT48X is
   called to obtain the next work day for a WORKCYCLIC period.
