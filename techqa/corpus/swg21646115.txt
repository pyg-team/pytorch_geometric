PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the Tivoli Common Reporting installation, if you provide the Federated Repository (LDAP) user credentials for WebSphere Application Server(WAS) user, then Common Reporting link will not be visible in the Tivoli Integrated Portal console. 

SYMPTOM
If Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) is installed with Federal Repository (LDAP) user, the user will not be added the required 'tcrPortalOperator' role. This role is required for the user to access the 'Common Reporting' portlet in the Tivoli Integrated Portal (TIP)/ Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) environment.


CAUSE
Tivoli Common Reporting installer uses the Websphere file repository user id (o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm) to assign users to tcrPortalOperator role. But for LDAP users, a different uid needs to be used to achieve the same.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After installing Tivoli Common Reporting, login to Tivoli Integrated Portal, go to the Users and Groups > User Roles page and select the tcrPortalOperator role for the particular user. After assigning the role to the user, re-login to Tivoli Integrated Portal and the Common Reporting link will be visible.
