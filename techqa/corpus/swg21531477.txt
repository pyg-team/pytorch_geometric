QUESTION
 What error code handling is available when using the direct.exe executable in a batch program? (SCI19203) 

ANSWER
The basic error functionality of the direct.exe is as follows:

(1) direct.exe returns the highest RC it received on processing all user input. This is a standard return code, so %errorlevel% is set at the shell. The user has to code to check it. For example:
if errorlevel 0 DoThis else DoThat

(2) there is no user control available over direct's return codes.

There is no masking of return code values on Windows. We will set the return code to the highest value received from executing the user commands. Usually, any value different from 0, 4, 8, 12 is an user RC.

If the user Runs a Task, then we will use the Run Task return code.
