ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  *******************
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
   *******************
   The customer exports his Project as EAR file out of WID
   6.1.2ifix004.
   Sometimes the created EAR file is missing some ****mapping.xml
   files as
   e.g. the
   KXPlusLoan_rules_MP00EJB.jar/KXPlus_Loan_Rules_MP00EJB/META-INF/
   KXPlus_Loan_Rules_MP00_Rule_JyoukenShijiHTTPExport_mapping.xml
   
   It could be the case that during creation of the EJB Staging
   projects
   the files get lost.
   
   We need WPS L3 to have a look at this PMR as the issue seems to
   be with
   the EJB staging projects that are created by runtime.
   
   
   *******************
   REPRODUCTION
   *******************
   We couldn't reproduce the problem locally yet, but the customer
   can
   reproduce it 1 out of 10 times on a japanese WID 6.1.2ifix004.
   So this
   may be a timing related issue:
   
   The steps the account team used to reproduce the problem are
   mentioned
   below:
   0. Download "59016.69D.760.20100217_ReProduce_PI_and_log.zip"
   file
      from ECuRep
      Open a new workspace and de-activate the Auto-build option in
   WID's
      project menu
   
   1. Import PI "Projects_with_dummy_PI.zip" into workspace.
   
   2. Try following steps several times
      (In my environment, I reproduced the problem in 10 tries.)
     2.1  Rename project name of "LB_KXPlus_WF_01" to another name
          (like "LB_KXPlus_WF_02").
     2.2  Rename project name of "KXPlus_Loan_Rules_MP00_01" to
          another name (like "KXPlus_Loan_Rules_MP00_02").
     2.3  Delete all ...App, ...EJB, ...Web projects within the
          workspace.
     2.4  Select "Project" > "Clean" to clean build the projects
          within the workspace.
     2.5  Check all "ejbModule/META-INF" folder of ...EJB projects
          if it has "10" ...mapping.xml files.
     2.6  If the generation fails, the number of ...mapping.xml
   files
          is less than 10 (9, in my environment)
