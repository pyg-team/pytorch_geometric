APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Applications that use the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and
   SQLJ (also called the JCC driver) to connect to a database with
   CCSID (coded character set identifier) 1156
   might disconnect from the database with an error including:
   'Unsupported ccsid, encoding, or locale: "1156".
   ERRORCODE=-4499'.
   
   The change that this APAR introduces is to allow applications
   that use the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ to connect
   to a database with CCSID 1156 without disconnecting from the
   database with that error, provided that the JDK (Java
   Development Kit) supports CCSID 1156.
   
   CCSID 1156 is BALTIC EBCDIC with the euro symbol.
   The non-euro-enabled counterpart of CCSID 1156 is CCSID 1112.
   At code point hex 9F where CCSID 1156 has the euro symbol,
   CCSID 1112 has the International Currency Sign
   (the character at Unicode code point U00A4).
   Even without the change that this APAR introduces,
   applications that use the IBM Data Server for JDBC and SQLJ to
   connect to a database with CCSID 1112 will not disconnect from
   the database with that error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If practical, as a workaround you can connect to a database with
   a CCSID other than 1156, such as CCSID 1112.
