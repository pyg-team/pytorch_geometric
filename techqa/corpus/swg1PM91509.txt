APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An authoring template is created that creates a content item in
   the current site area and places it in a workflow named "" with
   a draft stage named "". The AT has two elements that reference
   components as default values:
   
   An image component named "Image Component"
   An HTML component named "HTML Component"
   
   An authoring tool is created with the following New action
   properties:
   Authoring Template: Selected
   Selected AT: {the above authoring template}
   Site Area: Current
   Enable inline item creation: TRUE
   
   A user who has contribute access to all library item types and
   edit access to content item types can create a new content item
   in a site area with the above authoring template  using the WCM
   Authoring Portlet.
   The same user can NOT "inline create" a new content item using
   the authoring tool, the user gets the following message in the
   inline widget: "You are not authorized to perform this
   command."
   
   Creating content using authoring tools with inline option and an
   authoring template that has prepopulated component references
   may fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  grant the user editor access to the default components.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An authoring template is created that creates a content item in
   the current site area and places it in a workflow named "" with
   a draft stage named "". The AT has two elements that reference
   components as default values:
   
   An image component named "Image Component"
   An HTML component named "HTML Component"
   
   An authoring tool is created with the following New action
   properties:
   Authoring Template: Selected
   Selected AT: {the above authoring template}
   Site Area: Current
   Enable inline item creation: TRUE
   
   A user who has contribute access to all library item types and
   edit access to content item types can create a new content item
   in a site area with the above authoring template  using the WCM
   Authoring Portlet.
   The same user can NOT "inline create" a new content item using
   the authoring tool, the user gets the following message in the
   inline widget: "You are not authorized to perform this
   command."
   
   Creating content using authoring tools with inline option and an
   authoring template that has pre-populated component references
   may fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WCM was checking for editor access on the items referenced in
   the elements.  The code has been updated to perform the correct
   check.
