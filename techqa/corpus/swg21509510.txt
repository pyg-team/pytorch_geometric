QUESTION
 How do I delete a document hierarchy node, such as a blank page, so that it no longer processes rules or appears in a batchview listing? 

CAUSE
It is sometimes desired to remove pages or documents from a batch, as they are no longer needed or to simplify processing for a Verify operator.

ANSWER
The DeleteChildType from the Validations library can be used by running it from the parent of the object to be deleted and specifying the specific child. 

For example, to remove blank pages from a batch: 

 1. Create a special page type attached at the batch level called something like DeleteMe. 
 2. Use an action like BlankPagesIDBySize to identify the blank page:  * BlankPagesIDBySize (1000,DeleteMe)
    
    
 3. Create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type DeleteMe.


If building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object.
