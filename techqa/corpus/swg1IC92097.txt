APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The EgSharedClassLoader is not currently set as the thread
   context classloader when the evaluate method of a customer's
   JavaCompute node is executed. This means that in some
   instances the JavaCompute node may not be able to find a
   required class or resource, or may find one that is not
   deployed, but placed in the shared-classes directory.

   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The EgSharedClassLoader is not currently set as the thread
   context classloader when the evaluate method of a customer's
   JavaCompute node is executed.
   This means that in some instances the Java Compute node may
   not be able to find a required class or resource, or may find
   one that is not deployed, but placed in the shared-classes
   directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker v6.1 now sets the EgSharedClassLoader
   as the thread context classloader before calling the
   onInitialize and evaluate method's of a JavaCompute Node.
