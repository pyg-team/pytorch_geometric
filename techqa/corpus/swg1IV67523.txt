APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Change IBM Tivoli Monitoring so that its local data can reside
   in a file system separately from CANDLEHOME.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Since its inception, IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) has stored
   local data such as configuration files, log files, and
   historical data together with the installation files in
   CANDLEHOME.  For example, ITM normally installs in a directory
   named /opt/IBM/ITM.  Within that directory, it stores programs
   in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/bin and
   /opt/IBM/ITM/classes.  It also stores local data in subdirectory
    names like /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs.  This
   homogeneous design is a problem for installations that require
   an approach that keeps code in /opt and stores data in the /var
   file system.
   
   Under this APAR, ITM added a new mechanism to move local data to
   a different file system.  For example, data typically stored in
   /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs can be redirected to
   /var/IBM/ITM/config and /var/IBM/ITM/logs.  This new file system
   location is designated by the user at installation time, and it
   is referred to as CANDLEDATA.  A conversion utility is provided
   to implement CANDLEDATA for existing installations.
   
   Complete documentation for the new CANDLEDATA mechanism is
   available here:
