QUESTION
 I would like to change the settings for the maximum time that a commuter license can be checked out. I am familiar with setting the SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE environment variable in Microsoft Windows operating systems, but how do I change this environment variable on Apple Macintosh operating systems? 

ANSWER
The following information can be found in the Sentinel License Manager Network License Administrator's Guide:

The maximum length of time a user can check out a commuter license is specified by the SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE environment variable on the desktop computer. Set the value of this variable to the maximum number of days for which an end user can check out a commuter license. This should be a number between 1 and 30. On Mac and Linux, you can store this environment variable in the statisticsenv.sh script.

Environment variables for PASW Statistics are stored in the 'statisticsenv.sh' script file. The 'statisticsenv.sh' file can be edited using the following procedure:

Select the Macintosh hard drive icon on the Desktop (e.g. 'Macintosh HD')
Select the 'Applications' folder.
Locate the program launch icon of the version of Statistics program for which you wish to configure the maximum life of the commuter license.
Select the program launch icon using either (1) Ctrl+click or (2) right-click.
Select 'Show Package Contents'.
Select 'Contents'.
Select 'MacOs'.
Locate the file named 'statisticsenv.sh'.
Open the file with TextEdit.
If the SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE environment variable is not already defined in the file, add a line like the following at the end of the file:

export SPSS_COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE='x'

(Where 'x' is a number between '1' and '30'.)
If the line is already present in the file, change 'x' to reflect the maximum number of days that a commuter license can be checked out by this computer.
Select 'File'.
Select 'Close'.
Select 'Save'.
Close all open windows.
The commuter utility should now allow the client computer to check out a commuter license for 'x' number of days
