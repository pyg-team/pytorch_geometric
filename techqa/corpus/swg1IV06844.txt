APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity: 2
   Approver: gdc
   Compid: 5724C04LN
   Release: 6.2.2
   Abstract: Take Action not executed with KLZ FILEINFO attribute
   Environment: The Monitoring Agent for Linux OS 6.2.2
   
   Problem Description:
   On Linux the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS doesn't
   executes the TakeAction related to FILEINFO attribute group when
   there are multiple situations that monitor the same file.
   (cf. IV06842 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV06842])
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This problem does not occur when TEMS evaluate the situation.
   Adding a dummy 'valid formula (tautology)' into the formula to
   make TEMS evaluate the situation will solve this symptom.
   
   Example:
   ========
   *IF *VALUE File_Information.Path *EQ '/tmp/'
     *AND *VALUE Linux_File_Information.File *EQ test.txt
     *AND *VALUE Linux_File_Information.File_Content_Changed *EQ
   Yes
     *AND *COUNT
   Linux_Machine_Information.Number_of_Physical_Processors *NE 0
   ========
   
   The last term is a dummy to do it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On UNIX, the monitoring agent for UNIX OS does not execute the
   Take Action related to the FILEINFO attribute group when there
   are multiple situations that monitor the same file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The UNIX OS agent now correctly executes the Take Action.
