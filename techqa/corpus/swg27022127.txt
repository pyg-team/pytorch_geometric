 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 An error might occur when you redeploy Content Engine after you install Content Search Engine Client files. 

CONTENT
If you install Content Search Engine Client files as part of a Content Engine upgrade or following the installation of IBM Case Manager Platform Installation Tool (CMPIT) or IBM FileNet Composite Platform Installation Tool (CPIT), a Java error might occur when you then redeploy Content Engine on WebSphere Application Server or JBoss Application Server.


The error appears on the Content Engine Startup page in the field that is labeled CSE client version, at http://server:port/FileNet/Engine.

server is the host name of the machine where Content Engine is deployed. In a highly available environment, server is the name of one of the servers in the farm. 

port is the HTTP port that is used by the application server where Content Engine is deployed. 

 

To resolve the error, complete the following steps: 

 

 1. Using the application server console, stop and undeploy the FileNetEngine (Content Engine) application.
    
    
 2. Stop the application server where you deployed Content Engine.
    
    
 3. Delete the following directories and files on the application server where you deployed Content Engine:
    Application server type Files and directories to be deleted WebSphere Application Server WAS_install_path/profiles/profile_name/ config/temp/download/cells/node_name/ applications/FileNetEngine.ear 
    
    WAS_install_path/profiles/profile_name/cells/node_name/applications/FileNetEngine.ear
    
    WAS_install_path/profiles/profile_name/installedApps/cell_name/FileNetEngine.ear
    
    WAS_install_path/profiles/profile_name/temp/ node_name/server_name/FileNetEngine JBoss Application Server JBoss_install_path/server/server_name/work/jboss.web/localhost (delete the contents of the localhost directory)
    
    JBoss_install_path/server/server_name/tmp (delete the contents of the tmp directory) 
 4. Start the application server where you deployed Content Engine.
    
    
 5. Install the Content Search Engine Client files on the system where an IBM FileNet P8 component has been installed and uses these files.
    
    
 6. Start Configuration Manager and run the Deploy Application task for Content Engine.
    
    
 7. Restart the FileNetEngine application on the application server.
    
    
 8. Verify the state of Content Engine deployment by checking the Content Engine Startup Context page. Ensure that a version value appears in the field that is labeled CSE client version.
