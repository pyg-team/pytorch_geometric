APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An incorrect error message is reported if trying to remove a
   BLOCKADDR channel authentication rule which does not exist.
   
   The behavior seen is:
   
   SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(BLOCKADDR) ADDRLIST('x.x.x.x')
   action(remove)
   AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of MQ 7.5 or higher using SET CHLAUTH command.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A logic error in the queue manager channel authentication record
   lookup code meant that the correct error response was not
   returned in the event that no matching record was found. This
   prevented the generation of an appropriate error message to
   report that the authentication records was not found.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The queue manager channel authentication logic has been
   corrected to return the correct response when no matching record
   is found.
