PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker        *
   *                 using an ESQL query with an AND operator     *
   *                 in the WHERE clause                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If an ESQL query contains an AND        *
   *                      operator in the WHERE clause and one    *
   *                      of the expressions has to be            *
   *                      evaluated completely at the broker,     *
   *                      BIP2110 is thrown while evaluating      *
   *                      the query.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   BIP2110 is thrown when broker tries to evaluate an ESQL query
   with an AND operator in the WHERE clause having an expression
   that has to be evaluated completely at the broker rather than
   at the database, because the code does not handle this case
   correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that an ESQL
   query with an AND operator in the WHERE clause is evaluated
   correctly.
