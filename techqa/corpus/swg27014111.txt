Supported Environments Ending with IBM Cognos 8 Planning

Cognos is committed to supporting the latest technologies being used by our customers. As we move forward in our support for these newer technologies, IBM Cognos 8.4 Planning will be the last release to support the following environments: 

 * Relational Databases
 * Oracle 9i
 * Microsoft SQL Server 2000



Software Environments

All versions stated of an environment presume the initial release of a 3rd party product without any need for patches/service packs or equivalent terms unless stated. Equally, unless stated, IBM Cognos presumes that the 3rd party product has not been configured to disable new features (compatibility modes) and that all patches/service packs are upward compatible for our products from the versions stated.

 IBM Cognos Planning 8.4 is a 32-bit product and will integrate with 3rd party 32-bit libraries only. 

All references to Windows refer to Windows on x86 Architecture. 

Software environments listed for IBM Cognos 8 Planning 8.4 are listed as active, compatible or not supported. Environments denoted as active are the environments tested by Cognos. Although environments denoted as compatible may also be tested, testing may be limited or support may be based on upward compatibility statements from Cognos partners and third-party vendors. Older releases of environments may transition over time from active to compatible as significant testing would have occurred in previous Cognos releases.
