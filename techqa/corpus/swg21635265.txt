QUESTION
 How can I determine which version of the Tivoli Integrated Portal is installed? 

CAUSE
Usually the output of the listIU script is showing the version, but in case it hangs or cannot be used for other reasons, an alternative is needed to figure out the version of TIP.

ANSWER
Try this command: 

Windows: 

<TIP HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\bin\tipcli.bat Version


Unix:
<TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/tipcli.sh Version 

where <TIP HOME> is the installation directory for Tivoli Integrated Portal.
