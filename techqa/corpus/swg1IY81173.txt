ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:  Sun JRE 1.5.0_06 appears to not work with TEPS via
   IE.
   
   "Facts:
   - While using Sun JRE for TEP client in IE the ITM built-in
   browser is not working correctly.
   - Installing IBM JRE from ITM6 CD on the system does not help
   because IE still pick Sun JRE to run TEP client.
   - According to IBM support ITM6.1 is not supported with Sun JRE
   
   Request:
   - Either make TEP client in IE compatible with Sun JRE or make
   TEP client detect JRE vendor/version and prompt to force install
   and use of IBM JRE for TEP client in IE.
   The later was implemented by new "experimental" JRE that you
   sent me for this PMR.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  no workaround available, as L2 was unable to recreate the issue.
   
   Things to check:
   
   1.  Ensure within the IE options, under the Advanced tab, to
   uncheeck the box which states to use Sun JRE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Sun Java 1.5 overwrites the IBM clsid used to install IBM Java
   JRE 1.4.2. Since IBM's Windows JRE install (1.4.2) uses the same
   Windows CLSID as the Sun install, when the Sun JRE 1.5 is
   installed on Windows, it assumes the 1.4.2 clsid is a Sun clsid,
   not IBM, since they use the same one.   The Sun install then
   updates the clsid to point to the new Sun 1.5.x binaries. So
   when the TEP is executed, it attempts to use Sun java 1.5.x.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM java 1.4.2 runtime install for Windows nows creates a
   unique clsid in the Windows registry.  The TEP browser client
   applet html was changed to reference this new clsid. So even if
   the clsid that is shared by IBM and Sun is over written by the
   Sun install, the TEP client will still execute with the IBM
   runtime since it is now using the new unique clsid.
