Title: IBM The ServiceDeploy command for WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) does not include promoted properties from user-authored primitives - United States

Text:
sca-module-properties.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a mediation module is built using the serviceDeploy command, the mediation module properties file does not contain promotable properties of user-authored primitives. 

CAUSE
The WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus code for the serviceDeploy command was not upgraded to use 'human readable' format for its EMF model when the model changed. It uses a conversion that does not support promoted properties of user-authored primitives. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The <ProjectAPP.ear>/META_INF/ibmconfig/cells/defaultCell/applications/defaultApp/deployments/defaultApp/sca-module-properties.xml file holds the promotable properties.


As a workaround, complete the following steps: 

 1. Build the module with IBM Integration Developer and save the sca-module-properties.xml file, which contains the promoted properties. 
 2. Build the module with the serviceDeploy command. 
 3. Replace the empty sca-module-properties.xml file, which is created by the serviceDeploy command, with the file version that was created by IBM Integration Designer.
