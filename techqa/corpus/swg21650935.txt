PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CPIT 5.2 fails at step 23/28 while running the configPE.bat file. 

CAUSE
The CPIT installer does not allocate enough JVM heap memory to WebSphere application server running the installed applications.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2008 R2 x64

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open the cpit_install_stdout in C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\cpit_install_stdout.txt and look for the following errors.
Error: [FNRPE2131090482E]Server is being initialized. Retry the operation.
OUTPUT>ERROR: Failed to initialize the PE region.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the maximum and minimum JVM heap size for the WebSphere application server.




 1. Login to the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. 
 2. Navigate to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server1 
 3. Under Server Infrastructure expand Java and Process Management and click Process Definition.  1. Under Additional Properties click Java Virtual Machine. 
     2. In the Initial heap size and Maximum heap size boxes specify 512 and 1024.[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21650935&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21650935&aid=1] 
     3. Click Apply and then save your changes. 
     4. Stop and start the WebSphere server.
    
    
 4. Delete decompressed software folders to make room for re-running the install.  1. Under C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\decompressed delete the TDS, CE, WAS, WPXT folders. 
     2. Empty the Windows Recycle Bin.
    
    
 5.  
 6. Replace cpit.properties file in CPIT folder.  1. Remove the cpit.properties file from the CPIT folder where you ran the 5.2.0-CPIT-WIN.exe. 
     2. Replace it with the cpit.properties from C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\install-scripts. This will cause the installer to start at step 23. 
     3. Run 5.2.0-CPIT-WIN and specify the software directory and password you used during the initial install.
    
    


The install should start at step 23 and complete successfully. See the reference screen shot below.
