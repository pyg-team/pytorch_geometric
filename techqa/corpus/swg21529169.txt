QUESTION
 What does the global key startup message mean? (SCI12303) 

ANSWER
The global key is created when the steps are taken to do batch and RSD password encryption. If this encryption is not used the system generates a message that there is no global key, for this situation the message can be ignored. There
is no way to disable the message if encryption is not chosen. For further information on batch and RSD encryption see the section in the "CONNECT:Enterprise for UNIX System Administrator's Guide" about the ceukey command.
