ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM:
   SCHEDULES USING PM DATA CAN TAKE SO LONG TO LOAD THAT YOU THINK
   THE SYSTEM IS HUNG.
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:
   We saw one Insert in the log that took 655 seconds.
   I worked with L3 who suggested a more efficient SQL Insert
   Where clause.   I sent it to the client who said it made the
   Insert take only 1.295 seconds.
   L3 said I should now put in this APAR so they will change the
   code to make the more efficient SQL.
   The log, ITSUSRAW00834_MXServer-UI2_maximo_scheduled.log, is in
   Logs.zip sent 3/23/15.  It is available on EcuRep or I can send
   you a copy.
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   I cannot replicate but I have seen them do it on line and it
   hangs when they click Save for a Schedule with PM data.
   Even when we just did it for a single PM with a single Forecast
   date and waited for 5 minutes nothing happened.
   Now I see the log where it took 655 seconds for the insert.
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   This was the SQL that took 655 seconds:
   20 Mar 2015 09:40:45:991 [WARN] [MXServer-UI2]
   [CID-UIASYNC-3739423]
   BMXAT0165I - User:ACHAKRABO SPID:307 Scheduler project with
   unique
   identifier 1521 takes 671,139 milliseconds and exceeds the time
   limit ,
   the query is insert into skdresource (id, initialized, name,
   skdprojectid, objectid, objectname, refobjname, objrowstamp) (
   (select
   ('CRAFT_' || c.craft || '_' || c.orgid) as id,0, c.description
   as name,
   1521,c.craftid as objectid,'CRAFT', 'CRAFT', c.rowstamp as
   objrowstamp
   from joblabor jl, craft c where jl.craft is not null  and
   jl.orgid =
   'JNJ'and jl.jpnum in (select skdjp.jpnum from  skdpmforecastjp
   skdjp
   where ((jl.siteid is null) or (jl.siteid=skdjp.siteid)) and
   jl.orgid=skdjp.orgid and skdjp.skdprojectid = 1521 )  and
   jl.jpnum in
   (select jpnum from jobplan jp where jl.jpnum  = jp.jpnum and
   jl.pluscjprevnum = jp.pluscrevnum and jp.status in ( 'ACTIVE' )
   ) and
   jl.craft = c.craft and jl.orgid = c.orgid and c.craftid not in
   (select
   objectid from skdresource where skdprojectid = 1521 and
   objectname =
   'CRAFT') group by c.craft, c.description, c.craftid, c.orgid,
   c.rowstamp) ).
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   L3 rewrote the above Insert to be more efficient.   I gave it
   to the client to test and they said it was immensely faster,
   down to 1.295 seconds.   Here is new more efficient form:
   nsert into skdresource (id, initialized, name, skdprojectid,
   objectid, objectname, refobjname, objrowstamp)
   ((select ('CRAFT_' || c.craft || '_' || c.orgid) as id,0,
   c.description as name, 1521,c.craftid as objectid,'CRAFT',
   'CRAFT', c.rowstamp as objrowstamp
   from joblabor jl, craft c
   where jl.craft is not null
   and jl.orgid = 'JNJ'
   and exists      (select 1 from  skdpmforecastjp skdjp
                where ((jl.siteid is null)
                     or
   (jl.siteid=skdjp.siteid)
                     )
                and skdjp.jpnum = jl.jpnum
                and jl.orgid=skdjp.orgid
                and skdjp.skdprojectid = 1521
               )
   and exists      (select 1 from jobplan jp
                where jl.jpnum  = jp.jpnum
                and jl.pluscjprevnum =
   jp.pluscrevnum
                and jp.status in ( 'ACTIVE' )
               )
   and jl.craft = c.craft
   and jl.orgid = c.orgid
   and not exists       (select 1 from skdresource
                    where skdprojectid =
   1521
                    and objectname =
   'CRAFT'
                    and objectid =
   c.craftid
                   )
   group by c.craft, c.description, c.craftid, c.orgid,
   c.rowstamp) )
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   Run in 1 second, not 655.   For testing verify that the second,
   more efficient SQL is created.
