APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Situations with string type attributes are not enclosed in
   single quotes.  The display may show single quotes, but the
   situation predicate values within the CMS may not have single
   quotes.  This can cause problems with how the situation fires
   and when specifying multiple attributes can cause IB request
   errors 1203 rule syntax error and 1131 Bad lodge request.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add single quotes around string values, but there must be a
   change to the string itself for the situation predicate to get
   updated.  Single quotes added without a change to string are
   determined to be "no change" by the CNP and will cause the
   update to not be sent to the CMS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a situation is defined based on a String attribute and the
   test value
       contains embedded spaces, the saved situation will be
   reported as
       'Problem' by the server.

 *  The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
