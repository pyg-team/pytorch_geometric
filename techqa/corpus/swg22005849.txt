 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Customer is hosting their Controller database on an Oracle 12C server. How should they install the Oracle 12C client on their application server? 

CAUSE
If the Oracle client is installed incorrectly, or the wrong version of the client is installed, then the users will receive many different issues/errors.

ANSWER
The following is based on Controller 10.2.1 and 10.3. 

 * The instructions may vary slightly for other versions of Controller.


Steps: 

1. Download the latest patchset version of the Oracle 12C release 1 64-bit client. 

 

At the time of writing: 

 * The latest version is 12.1.0.2.0 
 * This is currently available from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-win64-download-2297732.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-win64-download-2297732.html] 
 * Specifically, you need to download “winx64_12102_client.zip”.


2. Extract this file (“winx64_12102_client.zip”) onto the Controller application server, and run 'setup.exe' 

 * VITAL: During the client installation wizard, select a full 'Administrator' install option:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22005849&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22005849&aid=1]  * Typically choose all the default options for the other wizard choices.


3. After the install has finished, check that it has installed all the expected components, by looking at the size of the "C:\app" folder (or wherever you have installed it to). The total size should be approximately 1.41Gb. 

 

4. Now create/edit your TNSNAMES.ORA file. 

 * By default, this is located here: C:\app\client\Administrator\product\12.1.0\client_1\network\admin 
 * Ensure that it contains entries on how to connect to your Oracle database server(s)


5. Next you need to create a ‘System Variable’ (on your Controller application server) called ‘TNS_ADMIN’ to point to the location of your TNSNAMES.ORA file. 

 * By default, the value would be: C:\app\client\Administrator\product\12.1.0\client_1\network\admin

======================================== 
TIP: Before continuing, due to a bug in Oracle ( https://community.oracle.com/thread/3653584 [https://community.oracle.com/thread/3653584] ) you will probably need to rename the registry key “HKLM\Software\Oracle” to “HKLM\Software\Oracle.OLD”. 
======================================== 
6. Next, download the latest patchset version of the Oracle 12C release 1 32-bit client. 

 

At the time of writing: 

 * The latest version is 12.1.0.2.0 
 * This is currently available from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-win64-download-2297732.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-win64-download-2297732.html] 
 * Specifically, you need to download “winnt_12102_client32.zip”.


7. Extract this file (“winnt_12102_client32.zip”) onto the Controller application server, and run 'setup.exe' 

 * VITAL: During the client installation wizard, select a full 'Administrator' install option:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22005849&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22005849&aid=3]  * The author recommends that you install this software to a SEPARATE folder (from the 64-bit client)  * For example, install it into the folder: C:\app_32\Administrator
   
   

8. After the install has finished, check that it has installed all the expected components, by looking at the size of the "C:\app_32" folder (or wherever you have installed it to). The total size should be approximately 1.41Gb. 

 
======================================== 

IMPORTANT: Finally, undo the registry key renaming that you did earlier. 

· In other words, rename the registry key “HKLM\Software\Oracle.OLD” to “HKLM\Software\Oracle”.
========================================


9. Configure ‘ccr-system-properties.properties’ file (to specify the location of the TNSNAMES.ORA file) by performing the following: 

 * Browse to this folder: C:\Program Files\IBM\cognos\ccr_64\server\integration 
 * For Oracle 12C, by default the location of the TNSNAMES.ORA file is usually the directory:  *  C:\app\client\Administrator\product\12.1.0\client_1\network\admin 
   
   

=> Therefore, in this default case, you need to modify the file ‘ccr-system-properties.properties’ as follows:  

# Oracle Network admin directory path, the location of the TNSNAMES.ORA file oracle.net.tns_admin= oracle.net.tns_admin=C:\\app\\client\\Administrator\\product\\12.1.0\\client_1\\network\\admin
