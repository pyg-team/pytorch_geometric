Title: IBM Missing files error when running a remote Decision Validation Services (DVS) test from Rule Designer - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to execute a Decision Validation Services (DVS) test from Rule Designer on a remote installation of Rule Execution Server (RES), a missing files error is seen.



SYMPTOM
When we try to run a DVS test using the Run Configuration from Rule Designer, the Run button remains greyed out. 

The error says: "The RES component of IBM Decision Server, does not seem to be installed. The default classpath might be incorrect and have missing files.." 


CAUSE
 

This error indicates that you have not installed RES on your local machine. Although it is possible to extend a given Eclipse installation with Rule Designer update sites, if the ODM Decision Server product is not installed on the machine the features related to RES and DVS will not be functional.

To conduct DVS tests, even if using remote testing, you need to install ODM Decision Server RES locally, since there is a dependency on RES libraries/variables in Rule Designer. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install ODM Decision Server on the machine where Rule Designer is to be run.
