APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Security AppScan Standard Edition 8.7.0.1 encounters an
   exception when attempting to export the scan results to an XML
   file (via File ? Export ? Results as XML...).
   
   This occurs because of the
   MSIISMissingHostHeaderInformationLeakage (Microsoft IIS Missing
   Host Header Information Leakage) vulnerability due to it not
   containing any Request or Response in the vulnerability
   information.  This causes the export to fail and the resulting
   XML file will miss any vulnerabilities that follow the
   MSIISMissingHostHeaderInformationLeakage vulnerability.
   
   The workaround to this is to mark the issue as Non-vulnerable or
   Noise (in the right click menu) prior to exporting the results.
