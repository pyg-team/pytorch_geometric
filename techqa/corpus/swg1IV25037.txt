APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Oracle Extended Agent can not be remote deploy to a remote
   window x64 by tacmd addsystem command and it reports the failed
   message about KAC component installation.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   1. Install Windows x86_64 OS agent only locally
   2. Addbundles for Oracle Extended Agent  for Windows platforms.
   3. Run remote deploy by tacmd addsystem command for the first
      time, this time the agent can be installed and configured
      successfully in OS agent site.
   4. Run tacmd addsystem command again to deploy a new agent
      instance, this time the KAC component will be transferred to
      the OS site and installed.
   
   Expected result: KAC component should not be installed as we are
                    in remote deploying the native 64bit agent.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Perform local installation of additional instances of the KOR
   Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using the "tacmd addSystem" command to add a second instance of
   the Extended Oracle Agent to a 64-Bit Windows endpoint results
   in an error.  The error states that the Agent Compatibility
   32-Bit/64-Bit Component (AC) is missing as a prerequisite to the
   addition of the instance.  When a 64-Bit Agent is installed on a
   64-Bit platform, there is no requirement for the AC Component to
   be present as a condition for the installation of additional
   instances.
   
   
   Installation of the Extended Oracle Agent also installs the
   32-Bit JRE Component.  When adding a second instance of the
   Agent, Remote Deploy detects that a 32-Bit JRE is installed on
   the machine,  and that the AC Component be a preqrequisite to
   the installation of the second instance of the Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Exclude the JRE Component as a prerequisite for the installation
   of additional Agent instances.
