CAMSOAALL CAMSOAINT CAMSOAUSE Security Token TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The new Security Token mechanism introduced with ITM 6.3 FP1 prevents SOA agent v7.2 GA to run any Take Action 

SYMPTOM
You get the following error in TEP when using SOA Agent with ITM version pre-6.3 FP1: 

Destination: ITCAM4SOA:<hostname>:D4 
Return Code:-1 
Message: Automation request rejected. User sysadmin has no security authorization credential!


CAUSE
SOA KD4 agent v7.2.0.0 is based on Agent framework 6.3 FP3 (Driver: tms630fp3:d4204a/4455501.19)

This means that it expects to exchange a Security Token as documented at following page:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631465 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631465]

Note that SOA prerequisite page has a missing information: it does not state ITM 6.3 FP1 as a minimum supported platform version, when using SOA 7.2.0.0:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First, you need to apply FP1 to current SOA v7.2 agent, in order to add support for ITM 6.3 FP1 

Then, please make sure to connect the agent to ITM 6.3 FP1 or later.

Here is an additional Technote useful to understand the security token mechanism:
