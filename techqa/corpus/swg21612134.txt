QUESTION
 On Linux platform, running CDC instance creates files in /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/ directory. What is the purpose of those files ? 

ANSWER
Files in /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/ are created by Java virtual machine to implement Java Attach API feature. 

Java Attach API can be used by IBM support to connect to running CDC instance and examine its internal state.
