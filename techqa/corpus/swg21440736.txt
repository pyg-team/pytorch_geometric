RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

 Considerations before collecting data 
Take note of the following before collecting the information described below:

 * Performance  * Runtime tracing may be verbose, and it could impact performance during peak time. If possible, reproduce the problem on a non-production environment to capture tracing.
      
   
   

 * Security  * Some trace strings could capture sensitive or personal infomation. Please be sure to sanitize the logs before uploading to IBM. Commerce uses data masking to help mask sensitive data. See Knowledge Center Masking Sensitive data in traces [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZLC2_7.0.0/com.ibm.commerce.developer.doc/concepts/csdlogging.htm?lang=en]
   
   


 COLLECTING DATA 
 I. Configure environment 

Follow the instructions below to configure your environment to capture the required diagnostic information: 

 1. Modify the wsadmin.properties file located WC_profile/properties/wsadmin.properties
     1. Uncomment the following line by removing the #: 
        #com.ibm.ws.scripting.traceString=com.ibm.*=all=enabled
        
    
    
 2. 
 3. Additional configuration steps:  1. Which Feature were you trying to enable?
        
    
    





ll. Validate the issue was captured 
Before sending logs to IBM, ensure that the issue being reported was captured. Recommend to review the following documents to help facilitate proper log collection: Avoiding pitfalls when collecting traces. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648137]

 SUBMITTING DATA TO IBM SUPPORT 
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR) 
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
