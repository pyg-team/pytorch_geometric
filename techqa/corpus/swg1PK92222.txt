ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   ********
   
   The action part, of a transition that comes out of a junction
   connector, is not and executed correctly.
   
   Desription:
   ***********
   
   The attached project contains a class with an attribute and a
   statechart. Depending upon the value of the attribute, 'state_1'
   is either used or not. The action part of the 'transition 4'
   between the 'junction connector' and 'state_2', is not executed
   if the gaurd condition for the 'transition 1' between 'state_0'
   and 'state_1' is not satisfied. However, the action part
   executes fine if the gaurd condition is satisfied.
   
   Workaround:
   ***********
   
   Using a 'state' in place of the 'junction connector' correctly
   executes the action part.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The action part of a transition that comes out of a junction
   connector is not executed correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In this case, the statechart is not well-formed. State_0 has
   2 enabled transitions, so the choice of which transition
   will be taken is arbitrary. Code generation will generate
   correct code only for well-formed statecharts.
