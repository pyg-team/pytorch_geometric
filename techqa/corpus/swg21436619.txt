Title: IBM Deleting Agent Messages from the Health Summary page - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you delete Agent Message entries from the SiteProtector Health Summary in the agent properties window? 

ANSWER
The health summary tab from an agent contains information about the sensor like when it started and when it stopped. This article provides steps to deleting these entries.

Those events will disappear after a while according to the purge default settings. If you would like to delete these directly and manually, you need to clear the sensor_info events from the analysis view for the sensor so it no longer appears on the health summary tab of the agent properties. You do this by right-clicking on thesensor_infoevent in the analysis view and choosingClear Events.

Then, you need to run the following query in SQL Server Management Studio:


EXEC iss_PurgeSD @BeginDate='yyyy-mm-dd', @ObsType='0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9', @ClearedOnly = 1, @PurgeFlag=1
EXEC iss_PurgeObs @BeginDate='yyyy-mm-dd', @ObsType='0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9', @ClearedOnly = 1, @PurgeFlag=1
EXEC iss_PurgeHealthInfoEvents @BeginDate='yyyy-mm-dd'

yyyy-mm-dd stands for the date from when you want to delete the health summary entries.

Note: Be aware that all data before this date that was deleted from the analysis view will now be deleted from the database.
