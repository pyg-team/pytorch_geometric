ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MMC/FEM throws an error and closes FEM ...when.
   
   You have a DocClass with an associated property template and
   this property is of type boolean ..and a default value has been
   set to either true or false.
   
   When you want to change this back to no value by clicking on the
   'Clear Default Value' button in the properties of the associated
   template ...MMC/FEM throws an error and crashes.

   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Unknown
   
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : Yes
   
   Is there a workaround? : Yes
   
   Work around:
   1_. Check the Property Template Node still has the original
   BLANK value
   setting - once that is then we proceed with the following.
   2_.Create a new DocClass.
   3_. Associate the errant property template with the new
   DocClass.
   4_. Refresh the Object Store.
   5_. Add a dec document object with your new DocClass
   6_. Check that property value is not set.
   7_. Once that is good then we move on to the DocClass with the
   issue.
   
   *NOTE* Each Property Template associated with a Document Class,
   gets a
   column in the table DocVersion to it.
   If you only have this one DocClass associated with this property
   template and remove the association from the doc class, then the
   column
   and any values it may of had get deleted.
   By creating a dummy docclass and associating the same property
   with
   dummy DocClass, we prevent the removal of the column from the
   database.
   
   8_. Expand the Node Document Class in FEM.
   9_. Locate your DocClass, go => Properties => Property
   Definitions.
   10_. Remove the errant property and apply.
   11_. Re-associate the property back to the DocClass (pulls this
   information from the data you see in the Property Templates
   node).
   12_. Apply and test.
   
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : Minimal
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y
   By Who - Fred Dunne
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1_. Open FEM and go to the Doc Class you will use for this test.
   2_. Select your DocClass and right click, selecting 'Add
   Properties to Class'
   3_. Create a single property class of type boolean and complete
   the wizard.
   4_. Once the property is created, right click on the Doc Class
   and select Properties.
   5_. Go to the properties tab 'Property Definitions'.
   6_. Select your new property and click on edit.
   7_. On the properties tabs of the property ...select 'More'
   8_. Under 'Default Value' click on either one of the two values,
   so that the other value is now unchecked.
   9_. Click OK then click Apply and lastly Ok to close.
   10_.Repeate the steps 4 to 7.
   11_. You should be on the More tab of the properties for you
   boolean property - Click on  'Clear Default Value' then click on
   ok.
   
   Actual Results: FEM closes.
   
   
   Expected Results: FEM to stay open and the value to be set so
   that there is no default value.
