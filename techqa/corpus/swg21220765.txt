Wily AutoProbeConnector SDK SR SR5 SR6 appserver deployment manager deploymentmanager nodeagent upgrading SDK TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An error occurs while starting the Deployment Manager, Nodeagent, or IBM WebSphere Application Server after upgrading the Javaâ„¢ SDK:


JVMXM008: Error occurred while initializing System ClassException in thread "main". Could not create the Java virtual machine.

JVMCI161: FATAL ERROR in native method: Try to invoke an instance method as a static method
at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<clinit>(ZipFile.java:79)
at com.ibm.jvm.io.LocalizedInputStream.getZipFileInputStreamClass (Native Method)
at com.ibm.jvm.io.LocalizedInputStream.<clinit> (LocalizedInputStream.java:82)
at com.ibm.jvm.io.ConsoleInputStream.localize (ConsoleInputStream.java:86)
at java.lang.System.initializeSystemClass(System.java:955)

JVMDG218: JVM is not fully initialized - will not do dump processing. 

CAUSE
Wily Introspect that is configured with Websphere Application Server did not update the AutoProbeConnector.jar file with the current Java SDK information. 
Whenever the Java SDK is updated, the AutoProbeConnector needs to be re-created for Wily.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following from a command prompt: 


C:\WebSphere\AppServer\wily532\connectors>C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\java\
bin\java -jar CreateAutoProbeConnector.jar -current -output AutoProbeConnector.jar

Output should look like:

8/12/05 10:58:33 AM PDT [INFO] [Creator] AutoProbe Connector Creation Utility Release 5.3.2 (Build 170311)

After performing the above, restart the Deployment Manager, Nodeagent, or Application Server.
