TPAESTARTCENTER maximo TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may experience an issue scenario where you are creating a new Start Center in Maximo and the database record gets written to the SCTEMPLATE table 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You may experience an issue scenario where you are creating a new Start Center in Maximo and the database record gets written to the SCTEMPLATE table, but the PRESENTATION field of this table is blank after the record is written. 

The log file will point to this error :
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl incompatible with javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory

Steps to replicate : 
- Log into Maximo. 
- Note Start Center options: Change Content/Layout, Display Settings, Create New Template, Modify Existing Template, Update Start Center. 
- Select Create New Template. 
- Change the Description (e.g., "JOE-TEST-04"). 
- In the Left Column, select the Select Content button. 
- Select KPI List and OK. 
- Select Finished. 
- Select Save Template. 
- Note: The new template does not appear as a tab in the Start Center, but it should. 
- Run this query on the database: select * from sctemplate order by createdon desc; 
- Note that all fields appear normal except for the PRESENTATION field, which is empty. 

In the SystemErr.log file you will see this : 

java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl incompatible with javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory

The first thing that we recommend you to check is about how exactly you rebuilt the EAR files from the environment where you are experiencing this issue (in case you are using WebSphere 8x version)

Did you manually build the maximo.ear file? If yes, which command did you use the build it? buildmaximoear.cmd or buildmaximoearwas8.cmd ? 

To build or rebuild the Maximo 7.5.0.8 (or 7.5.0.7) EAR file with WebSphere 8, only the buildmaximoearwas8.cmd file will work properly to build all the java classes required.

If you are not sure, we recommend you to rebuild and redeploy the EAR files, but this time make sure that you use the buildmaximoearwas8.cmd command. 

Then redeploy the maximo.ear on the WebSphere Server, clear cache and the issue should be resolved.
