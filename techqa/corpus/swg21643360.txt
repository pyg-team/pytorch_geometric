Title: IBM Access to content using /mycontenthandler/ URIs is rejected with HTTP 401 Unauthorized. - United States

Text:
HTTP 401; Unauthorized; GET; mycontenthandler; timeout.resume.session TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Portal is configured with an external security manager such as IBM Security Access Manager (Tivoli Access Manager), CA Siteminder or a custom Trust Association Interceptor (TAI). 

The Organize Favorites and Page Properties portlets do not show the expected content even for the Portal Administrator.

All requests for URIs that contain /myportal/mycontenthandler/ are rejected with HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

The resulting Page Properties page is displayed without its corresponding stylesheet.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Capture the issue using Fiddler http://fiddler2.com/ [http://fiddler2.com/] (preferred) or a similar tool. Observe that GETs for theme-related objects return HTTP 401 as in the examples below:

/.../mycontenthandler/!ut/p/digest!192eVEENLPziU-evq2Nu0w/dav/fs-type1/common-resources/ibm/css/common.css

/.../mycontenthandler/!ut/p/digest!192eVEENLPziU-evq2Nu0w/dav/fs-type1/themes/PageBuilder2/css/master.css

/.../mycontenthandler/!ut/p/digest!192eVEENLPziU-evq2Nu0w/dav/fs-type1/themes/PageBuilder2/js/init.js



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the Integration Solutions Console, navigate to: Resources > Resource Environment > Resource Environment Providers 


Locate WP ConfigService and select Custom Properties. 

If the property timeout.resume.session is not in the list of custom properties, add it with value true and restart the Portal.
