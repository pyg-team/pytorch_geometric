PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
How can you configure the Netcool Omnibus ITM Agent silently? 

SYMPTOM
 

There is no response file to silently install the Netcool/Omnibus ITM Agent


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

The response file is in /opt/IBM/ITM/samples or equivalent directory 

The silent_config.txt file is the generic response file for an agent. Configure the ITM parameters that are desired. Also add these 2 parameters for the agent-specific configuration. For example: 
# Location of the metrics log files for the OMNIbus agent 
KNO_LOG_DIR=/opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus/log 

# Name of the ObjectServer to monitor 
KNO_OBJSRV_NAME=NCOMS 

Then run this command to do the silent config: 

itmcmd config -p <absolute_path_to_response_file> -A no 

If the files do not exist in the samples directory then you need to do the following:

$CANDLEHOME/bin/itmcmd manage & 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438008&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21438008&aid=1]

The agent will supply the silent_install.txt file, but you must generate the silent_config.txt parameter file using an installed agent. This file can then be used as a template. To create the silent config response file, open the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) window, right-click selected agent and choose "Advanced/Utilities/Generate Response Files" menu option. Be aware that in created file, all passwords/encryption keys need to be provided manually. This file can then be modified and used as the parameter to configure other instances of that agent.
