 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 You can change a setting in your IBM Case Manager desktop to prevent the behavior that requires users to select a folder when adding case documents. 

CONTENT
You can configure a case type setting in Case Manager Builder to allow users to add documents from non-case management repositories. However, with this setting, users might also be required to select a folder when they add a case document. 

Workaround:

You can prevent this behavior of requiring the user to select a folder by changing the default setting in the IBM Case Manager desktop:

1. As an administrator in IBM Content Navigator, navigate to Desktops > Case Manager and click the General tab.
2. Expand the Desktop Configuration settings.
3. Under Additional Settings, uncheck the setting Require users to save new documents and folders in a folder.
4. Save your changes.
