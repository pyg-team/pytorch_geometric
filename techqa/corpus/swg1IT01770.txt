APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When logging is set to high levels, it is possible for the
   memory consumption of the logging procedures to become very
   large.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MessageSight appliance who
   have logging set to a high level while there is a high volume of
   messaging occurring.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When log messages are being generated at a very high rate, the
   logging routines are designed to limit the number of log entries
   that can be queued for writing to the log file. The intention of
   this is to limit the amount of memory that can be consumed by
   queued log entries when the system is under heavy load and the
   logging level is high. There was an error in the logging routine
   that resulted in new log entries always being queued, regardless
   of how many were already queued. Under certain circumstances,
   the rate at which new entries are queued can exceed the rate at
   which they can be processed and written to the log files. when
   this happens, the memory usage of the logging component can
   become very large.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The logging routines have been updated to ensure that when the
   maximum threshold for queued log entries has been reached, new
   entries are discarded. This continues until enough of the
   previously queued log entries have been processed and the number
   of queued entries is reduced to a lower threshold.
