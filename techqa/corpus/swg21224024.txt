Title: IBM Java core dump and product failure results with incompatible firewall software cahookd.dll - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you are using cahookd.dll firewall software with IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD), a RAD failure can occur when you are trying to specify a URL for the export feature for Portal or creating a new WebSphere® Test environment version 5.x and overwriting the hostname in the wizard. Rational Application Developer becomes unresponsive and eventually stops, giving an error message that indicates a Java™ core dump that references the cahookd.dll file. 

CAUSE
The Java Core dump contains the following reference to a cahookd.dll:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Cahookd.dll is contained in firewall software from CyberArmor. Running this firewall software on a machine where RAD is installed causes an access violation to occur, resulting in a RAD failure, when either of the following tasks are performed: 

 * Tying to specify a URL for the export feature for Portal 
 * Creating a new WebSphere® Test environment version 5.x and overwriting the hostname in the wizard


RAD installations running on machines without this specific firewall software do not exhibit this behavior when the stated tasks are performed. Also, Rational Application Developer works well with other firewall software.
