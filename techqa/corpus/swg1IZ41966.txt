ERROR DESCRIPTION

   Approver : GC
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  I've placed a zip file (HF_70536,487,000.zip) that contains 2
   modified
   SDMS bat files.
   
   The fix affects two SDMS script files.
   
   1)
   DMS/ws/code/com.ibm.management.soa.dms.config/src/kd4TestSDMSdb2
   dbAuthor
   ization.bat
   2)
   DMS/ws/code/com.ibm.management.soa.dms.config/src/kd4TestSDMSdb2
   dbConnec
   tion.bat
   
   To apply the fix:
   
   a)
   
   Back up the kd4TestSDMSdb2dbAuthorization.bat  and
   kd4TestSDMSdb2dbConnection.bat scripts in the
   <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin and
   <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\latest\bin  directories
   
   b)
   
   Extract the updated scripts from the HF_70536,487,000.zip
   Copy the updated scripts to the <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin
   directory  and to the  <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\latest\bin
   
   After updating the scripts, run ConfigDMS from the
   <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin directory to update the
   authentication
   for the SDMS and TCORE databases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ITCAM for SOA script needs modification to handle "!" character
   being passed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix for this problem will be available on next
   available formal maintenance for ITCAM for SOA 7.1
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX

   upgraded script to correct this problem.
