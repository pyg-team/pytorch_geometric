APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the IBM Content Collector configuration backup host was
   restarted (full machine restart) while the primary Content
   Collector node was down, neither Configuration Manager nor
   the Task Routing Engine service could  be started on the
   secondary node. Configuration Manager tried to connect to the
   primary configuration host in an endless loop, which failed
   because the primary node was down. The following error
   message was displayed:
   
        Unable to contact the Configuration Access service at:
   
        Ensure that the following Windows services are running:
        - IBM Content Collector Configuration Access
        - IBM Content Collector Configuration Store
        - IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Manager
   
        Waiting for the configuration store to be accessible...
   
   When you try to restart the Task Routing Engine service, the
   following error message is displayed:
   
       The IBM Content Collector Task Routing Engine service on
       Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop
       automatically if they are not in use by other services or
       programs.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After the secondary server is restarted, the user can use
   the cluster tool to reconfigure the secondary (and make it
   primary since the other primary is down).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, Configuration Manager as well as the
   Task Routing Engine service work as expected on the
   configuration backup host.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
