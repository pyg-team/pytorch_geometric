QUESTION
 Why am I seeing this PAL on my IBM i machine. 

CAUSE
On IBMi partitions that are *OPSYS managed this PAL will appear on most IPL's

ANSWER
As long as it is classified as an INFO PAL, it is the result of the machine being a standalone where the Hypervisors' only way to communicate with the rest of the work is via the front panel of the system and through LIC and the IBM i operating system. 

Check to see if the MSD manager has any dumps saved in it. 

Check for any PALS around the same time that any PERM errors are posted and work those issues accordingly.
