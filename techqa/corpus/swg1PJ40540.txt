APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to reproduce:
   1. Use an object store with a large # of document classes (e.g.
   more than 1k).
   2. Create a search template or open an existing search template
   that includes DocumentTitle in the results columns.
   3. Open the search in Workplace XT, the search will open slowly.
   Subsequent searches will load quickly but if you restart the app
   server to clear any caches, the search will again take a long
   time to load (a minute or more).
