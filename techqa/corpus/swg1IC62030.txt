PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker        *
   *                 version 6 or higher using the MRM-XML        *
   *                 parser to parse decimal fields with          *
   *                 whitespace occurring before a negative       *
   *                 sign character.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Using MRM-XML to parse an xsd:decimal   *
   *                      where the value contains a space        *
   *                      before the negative sign such as        *
   *                      " -100" causes a BIP5505 error.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When parsing an xsd:decimal with the MRM-XML parser leading
   whitespace before a negative sign is not tolerated resulting
   in a BIP5505 error. The xsd:decimal type has a facet of
   whiteSpaceCollapse meaning that sequences of whitespace should
   be reduced to one space character and then up to one space
   character removed from the beginning and end of the value so
   Message Broker should not throw a parsing exception under
   these conditions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to succesfully
   parse xsd:decimal fields with leading whitespace when using
   the MRM-XML parser.
