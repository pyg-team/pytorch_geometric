Title: IBM NPS queries on _v_jdbc_pdfk2 return duplicate results for user tables created in the SYSTEM database - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User tables that are created in the SYSTEM database and queried for table information like 
primary key or foreign key could return more than the expected number of rows. 

ENVIRONMENT
Netezza Platform Software releases 7.1.0.6, 7.0.4.9, and 7.2.0.5 releases

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The SYSTEM database is reserved for storing system objects and users should not create tables in that database. There is no workaround for the duplicate results in the affected releases, but a fix is in progress for a future fix pack.
