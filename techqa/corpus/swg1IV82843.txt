 *  Avoid using agents with 14 character long
   ComputerSystemDisplayName.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The error that happens while adding the workstation to the pool
   is caused by a very rare condition: the xml file containing the
   Logical Resource is corrupted (a coupple of wrong characters are
   presente at the end). An additioanl check to validate the xml
   needs to be added on zOS connector component.
