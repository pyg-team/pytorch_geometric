APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When saving a filter in the Admin&Operations facility, events
   DNPO0007E nested with event DNPO0006E can occur, if the filter
   cannot be saved.
   The event DNPO0006E, reporting the underlaying error, doesn't
   contain information like date, time, service and OU, which is
   mandatory information for an event.
   
   Furthermore, the user must get an error response when saving his
   filter fails. This is currently not the case.
   
   Last, the WBIFN administrator needs to know for problem
   analysis, that the table, where a filter is stored (DNI_UPREF)
   contains an identity column, however, the table is not mentioned
   in the related section in the WBIFN System admin guide ("When
   saving a filter in the Admin&Operations facility, events
   DNPO0007E nested with event DNPO0006E can occur, if the filter

   *                      SURE, THAT THE USER GETS AN ERROR       *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Formerly, when a DB2 error occured during the 'save filter'
   action for events in AO Facility, an event with ID DNPO0007E
   was issued, containing the text of MPU DNPO0006E as error text.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, there are two separated events. One with ID DNPO0006E
   followed by an additional event with ID DNPO0007E. The user
   gets a response, that the runtime database was not accessible.
