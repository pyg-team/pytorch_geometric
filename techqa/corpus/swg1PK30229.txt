APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - New function for Filters called levels. Levels facilitate
   logical AND conditions at the log code level.
   - New function to support leap second offset. New time options
   have been introduced to adjust timestamps by a leap second
   offset. Leap second offset can be applied either by using the
   CVTLSO system settings or extrapolated from records in the IMS
   log.
   - New function to support large files (LFS)
