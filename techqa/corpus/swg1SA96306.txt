PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Collective service delivery for the set of MQ520 CSD09 PTFs
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SA96028 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96028] - MQM400 CHGMQMQ NOT RECOGNIZING *SAME PARAMETER OPTION
             When using the CHGMQMQ command to change the Put
             Enabled, Triggering Enabled, Sharing Enabled or Get
             Enabled parm from *YES to *SAME, the parameter changes
             to *NO.
   SA96202 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96202] - MQM400 USER MANAGED JOURNAL RECEIVER DOES NOT SWITCH
             User Managed Journal Receiver: The RCDMQMIMG *ALL *ALL
             *YES command does not switch when a journal receiver
             size has exceeded its THRESHOLD value.  The receiver
             keeps on growing until it is MANUALLY detached.
   SA96224 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96224] - MQM400 RPG APPLICATION FAILS WITH ERROR CODE RC2023
             In RPG programs, MQINQ returns RC 2023
             (MQRC_INT_ATTRS_ARRAY_ERROR) when IACNT (IntAttrCount)
             is 0, or RC 2067 (MQRC_SELECTOR_ERROR) when SELCNT
             (SelectorCount) is 0.
   SA96244 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96244] - MQM400 CLUSQMGR FIELD OF CLUSTER QUEUE CREATED USING C
             CRTMQMQ IS INVALID WHEN MESSAGE QUEUE MANAGER NAME
             IS *DFT
             Clustering: The field 'Cluster queue manager name
             (CLUSQMGR) in a queue definition is displayed
             incorrectly when using runmqsc or WRKMQMCLQ list if
             the parameter MQMNAME is set to *DFT when the queue
             was created by CRTMQMQ or CPYMQMQ or modified by
             CHGMQMQ.
   SA96247 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96247] - MQM400-F/AMQXSSMS_N-MSGMCH3601 ANY MQ COMMAND HANGS
             AND FDC IS THROWN FOR PROBEID XY353001 COMPONENT
             XSTCONNSHAREDMEMSET.
             The problem MCH3601 is most likely caused by the
             MQSeries SharedMemSet control block getting corrupted
             by another process. This APAR is shipping a partial
             fix which avoids the evaluate pointer exception, and
             logs a new FDC report with probe 1 in function
             xstConnSharedMemSet, which includes a dump of the
             corrupted data area.
   SA96249 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96249] - MQM400 MCH0601 (STATEMENT 116) FOR DECODEANDRUNCOMMAND
             RUNNING AN MQSC COMMAND WHICH IS NOT BEING PROPERLY
             NULL TERMINATED.
             Running an MQSC command which is not being properly
             null terminated fails.  The job log of the application
             failing with MCH0601 shows that we are failing at
             statement 116 in procedure DecodeAndRunCommand for
             program AMQOCPPX in module AMQOCPPX_N.
   SA96280 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96280] - MQM400 - STRMQMMQSC DISPLAY QLOCAL(*) FAILS MSGMCH6902
             Issuing the MQSC command DISPLAY QLOCAL(*) fails with
             a MCH6902 and C2M1212 for the STRMQMMQSC command.
   SA96283 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1SA96283] - CHGMQMQ COMMAND DOES NOT WORK AFTER CSD08 IS APPLIED
             After applying CSD08, the CHGMQMQ command does not
             work. When a change is attempted, the AMQ8008 message
             is displayed stating that the change has occurred, but
             a display of the queue shows the attributes have not
             been changed. This problem is not reported when using
             the ALTER MQSC command to change the queue attributes.
   .
   IY48070 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY48070] - MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE 2033 WITH MESSAGES AVAILABLE ON
             THE QUEUE
             Customer writes groups of messages to a queue.  Later,
             if they try to get a message from this queue, they
             will receive reason code 2033 (0x000007f1 NO MSG
             AVAILABLE MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE).  When this problem
             occurs, if the customer restarts their queue manager,
             then the same application is able to get the message
             successfully.
   IY48319 - MQPUT1 ERROR 2141 DLH_ERROR FROM COMMAND SERVER.
             If the reply message from the command server cannot be
             put to the reply queue passed in the PCF command, the
             command server fails to put the reply message to the
             DLQ with an MQPUT1 failure of 2141 MQRC_DLH_ERROR.
   IY49278 - MQGET RC=MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_FAILED WHEN THE BUFFER IS
             BIG ENOUGH
             When an application puts multiple messages to a queue
             and they are segmented by the queue manager, it is
             possible that the program which gets the messages may
             receive a reason code of MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_FAILED if
             its buffer is not large enough to contain the largest
             messages on the queue.
   IY49438 - MQBEGIN FAILS WITH RC= 2128 ( MQRC_UOW_IN_PROGRESS ).
             Two applications connect to the same Qmgr and they
             execute 2 PC transaction at the same time. If one of
             them executes transaction (not 2PC transaction)
             without MQBEGIN after next MQBEGIN of the other
             application fails with 2128.
   IY49686 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY49686] - MULTI-THREADED C++ APP STARTS SEVERAL THREADS, A NEW
             QMGR OBJECT CAN ONLY BE CREATED ONCE THE GET OF THE
             IMQQUEUE HAS FINISHED.
             If a multithreaded C++ client application attempts to
             connect to a Queue Manager which is unreachable the
             MQCONN waits while the client attempts to connect to
             the Queue Manager.  During this time all other MQI
             calls are unable to complete and hang as they are
             waiting on the MQCONN to return.  This meant
             potentially other threads would also hang until the
             MQCONN returned.
   IY49687 - UNINITIALIZED FIELDS IN AMQ7217.
             Message for error AMQ7217 has blank fields.
   IY50188 - CLUSSDR CHANNEL FAILS TO START WHEN MESSAGES ARE PUT
             UNDER SYNCPOINT.
             Clustering: sender channels fail to start
             automatically when messages arrive on the
             SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE. These channels remain
             in INACTIVE state after disconnecting normally due to
             reaching DISCINT.
