Title: IBM Large data files could cause environment exports to fail with an error - United States

QUESTION
 Why does exporting large data objects sometimes fail when performing a WebSphere Product Center environment export? 

ANSWER
When you export a large number of WebSphere Product Center objects, the export might fail with the following error if the data files are too large: 

Error occurred while archiving..., Exception; A file cannot be larger than the value set by ulimit.
java.io.IOException: A file cannot be larger than the value set by ulimit

The reason is that Java limits the size of zipped files to 2 GB. This is a limitation of the Java zip utility. This limit is applied even if the ulimit for file size is set to "unlimited". If the objects that you are exporting will create a data file (.zip file) that is larger than 2 GB, the export will fail with this error. Any data that exceeds this 2 GB limit is not included in the zipped file.

A large export can be divided into smaller exports where each export would have fewer objects than those in the original export. If there is a single object that is larger than 2 GB and can't be exported in smaller exports, contact IBM support for further assistance.
