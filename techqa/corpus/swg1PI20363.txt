APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading WebSphere Application Server from version
   8.5.0.2 to 8.5.5.1, when enabling WebServices Security SAML
   runtime trace, getting this message:
   The configured trace state included the
   following specifications that do not match any
   loggers currently registered in the server:
   ''com.ibm.ws.wssecurity.saml.*=all''
   This is likely to occur when specifiying trace events for a
   specific package.  The issue is that the specific package does
   not match the "registered loggers", a set of of groups and
   classes that are registered to the trace service.
   One might also see TRAS0040I messages logged, for example
   [10/22/14 19:17:22:249 EDT] 00000120 ManagerAdmin  I
   TRAS0040I: The configured trace state included the following
   specifications that do not match any loggers currently
   registered in the server: com.ibm.ws.wssecurity.saml.*=all
   This message appearing to be an error, although user later
   finding out that there is no problem with this trace
   specification.
