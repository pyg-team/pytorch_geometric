APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR IT01763 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT01763] provided functionality to suppress Content-Length
   in HttpRequest header for GET method.
   
   If a "Content-Length: 0" header is required then it can be
   explicitly requested by using ESQL in a Compute node before the
   HTTPRequest node to
   SET OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
   
   However, when you specify the Content-Length as 0 (i.e. the
   value without quotes) then broker throws an error:
   
   BIP2328E: A value of SQL datatype ''INTEGER'' encountered when
   datatype ''CHARACTER''.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the content-length as
   SET OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V9.0 using the HttpRequest
   node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   You should be allowed to suppress the "Content-Length" for the
   GET or HEAD method when the request is empty, i.e. has a length
   zero.  If  "Content-Length: 0" header is required in the HTTP
   Request  then it can be explicitly requested  by using ESQL in a
   Compute node before the HTTPRequest node.  The ESQL  can be
   written as:
      SET OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
   
   However, if the ESQL is written so that the Content-Length is
   set to 0 (i.e without single quotes) then an error is thrown at
   runtime as follows:
   BIP2328E: A value of SQL datatype ''INTEGER'' encountered when
   datatype ''CHARACTER'' expected.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now allows you to specify the Content-Length in
   HttpRequestHeader to 0 in either form.
