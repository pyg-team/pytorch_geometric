QUESTION
 How to collect the logs and config info on the Data Collector for ITCAM for AD 7.1 on a Linux/Unix system. 

ANSWER
The location of the logs has changed in ITCAM for Application Diagnostics v7.1 on the Data Collector. There are two types of logs that are available and can be collected: WAS server logs and the Data Collector logs. If you have the WAS TEMA also installed, then you may also need to collect the TEMA config and logs info. See the Related links info below. 

This technote is specifically for Linux/Unix systems. Here is the Windows [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21440466] equivalent of this technote. [http:///]

(Note: In this technote, default directories are used. If you are using a non-Linux platform (like AIX, or HP-UX or Solaris, simply replace the 'opt' in the path with 'usr' or if you are using non-default directories, then collect the logs using the non-default directories.) 

* Collecting the WAS server logs: The default WAS server logs for the profile AppSrv01 server server1 are located in this directory. (See first screenshot below.) To collect these WAS Server logs you can use the standard tar command or use the ITCAM-provided cyn_collector.sh script to collect the WAS server logs and the WAS server config info. The output log file created is in the /root/tmp/CYN/ dir. Send this output file to your friendly IBM support engineer for analysis.

* Collecting the Data Collector logs: Simply use the cyn_collector.sh script again, this time with just the -a option as shown here. This will collect the DC logs, the DC config info and the WAS server logs too. Send this output file to your friendly IBM support engineer for analysis.
