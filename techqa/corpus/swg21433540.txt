QUESTION
 How do I install IBM WebSphere Portal Server, Enable, Extend or Express edition V6.1 on IBM i V7R1 operating system? 

CAUSE
WebSphere Portal V6.1.5.1 is the first release of Portal to support IBM i V7R1. The following document describes what to consider when installing WebSphere Portal or Portal Express V 6.1.5.1 on IBM i V7R1. The process is to install WebSphere Portal with the 6.1.5 fresh install and then upgrade to 6.1.5.1 by applying the 6.1.0.4 fix pack. Later fix pack service levels are also supported.

ANSWER
Details: 

 * The first step to install WebSphere Portal on IBM i V7R1 is to install WebSphere Application Server V6.1 on the system where WP V6.1.5 is to be installed. Note that the Application Server install media that is included in WP or WP Express V6.1.5 does not support IBM i V7R1. The V7R1 installation media enabled Application Server installer must be used. 
 * The required WebSphere Application Server level for installing WebSphere Portal 6.1.5 on IBM i V7R1 is WebSphere Application Server 6.1.0.29 (V7.0.0.7 is not supported with WebSphere Portal Express).


Installing on WebSphere Application Server 6.1.0.x: 

The following table shows the Application Server V6.1.0.29 install images enabled for installing on IBM i V7R1.

Higher service release levels should be used, if available.
   
   Note: IBM i V7R1 does not support the classic JVM, which is the default JVM that WebSphere Portal or WP Express v6.1 configures. During install or additional profile configuration, this default JVM must be changed to use a supported JVM on IBM i V7R1 (JVM J9). This is done by passing the parameter enableClassicJVM.active=false.
   
   install.sh -W enableClassicJVM.active=false
   
   If this was not used, the profile can be changed after configuration to allow it to start by running the following from QSHELL:  1. From the i5/OS command line: STRQSH 
    2. and then: cd /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/AppServer/<version>/<release>/bin 
    3. and end with the command: enableJVM -jvm std32 -profileName <profile_name>
