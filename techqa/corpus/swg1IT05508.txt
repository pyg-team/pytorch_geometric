APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After the Call Home function creates the Problem Management
   Report (PMR) ticket it attempts to upload the problem files to
   the PMR ticket system. If it fails it retries.
   
   The user noticed that during retries the source of the
   failure events seemed to change. Sometimes it specified
   "PureSystems Manager SN#XXXXXXX" and other times it had a source
   similar to "Cluster Cluster 1".
   
   This created 2 separate sets of correlated events. When the
   upload retry succeeded only one of the failure event sets would
   be resolved.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.0.0.1 to prevent invalid retry events from being created.
