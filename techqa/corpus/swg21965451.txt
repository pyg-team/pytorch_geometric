VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2012-5784 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5784]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Axis 1.4, as used in multiple products, could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server and launch further attacks against a vulnerable target.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79829] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2014-3596 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3596]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Axis and Axis2 could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by and incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
