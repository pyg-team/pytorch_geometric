ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: SmartFlow server licensing does not work with V5
   installed
   .
   Operating System:  Windows2000
   Product Group:  SmarTeam 110 on WinNT
   Area Affected: SmartFlow Licensing
   Showstopper: NO
   Regression: NA
   Recommended Fixes Installed: YES
   .
   Environment:
   Both machines have win 2000 with Catia V5R7 SP3, and
   SmarTeam SP4.
   .
   Problem:
   Hi,
   I cannot get the SmartFlow to work with a network (red)
   dongle when I have Catia V5 installed.  I have 2
   machines; one set up as a TeamPDM Client and the other
   setup as a TeamPDM server with a red dongle.  The dongle
   contains 5 licenses for all of the SmarTeam products.
   What I am trying to do is to run SmartFlow on the client,
   however, it cannot find the SmartFlow License on the
   server.
   The NetHasp.ini file is set correctly, as well as the
   SmTeam32.ini file; I made sure that the NetworkPlug =
   Yes, and I have enabled TCPIP and entered all IPs
   correctly.  If I run the LicenseDiagnostics.exe from the
   bin directory of the TeamPDM install on the client, it
   detects that I have a network(red) dongle.  It also
   detects all of my licences.  Also, if I remove Catia V5,
   everything works perfectly fine without making any
   changes.
   I believe that this problem is caused by Catia licensing
   with SmarTeam because if I remove V5 everything works.
   Please advise me on the Problem,
   
   
   
   Hi,
   I have just tested this with Service Pack 5 for V5R7 and
   this
   still does not work.
   
   
   The Client has win2000 with a nodlocked AL2 license.  The
   server
   has has win2000 with a red network dongle for SmarTeam.  The
   server
   is using NeHasp licensing for SmarTeam and does not or never
   had
   Catia or any Catia licensing installed.  If I run the
   smarTeam
   licensing diagnostics on the client, it detects the dongle.
   Also,
   if I unistall Catia on the Client everything works as it
   should.
