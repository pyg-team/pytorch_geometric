ABSTRACT
 General Availability of IBM CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) V4.3 was 25 July 2008. CICS VR V4.3 delivers numerous enhancements to optimize IT operations, improve auditability and governance support, and improve usability and serviceability. 

CONTENT
CICS VR is a member of the IBM CICS Tools family and is used to recover CICS and batch VSAM data from physical or logical corruption. This helps you recover from errors quickly, reducing the need for off-line processing to exceed its batch window, and so improves the availability of your online CICS systems.

New capabilities in CICS VR V4.3 include: 

 * Print and logstream copy enhancements
   
 * Configurable scavenger start times and reduced Recovery Control Data Set (RCDS) contention at logcopy
   
 * Avoidance of duplicate recovery runs
   
 * New security authorization for batch logging and RCDS updates at notification
   
 * Improved server configuration and installation
   
 * Consistent timestamp display
