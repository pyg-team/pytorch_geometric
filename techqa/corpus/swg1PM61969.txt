APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
    The situation Apache_HTTP_Stopped, and custom situations based
    on attributes from TEP group "Apache Web Servers"creates
    multiple rows in the database:
       Not running Apache server causes creation of multiple rows
       with all Web Servers and Apache subnodes,
       what caused unnecessary entries in database and multiple
       situations visible in situation workspace and
       tool tip window, when Advance Situation Option "Display
       Item" is set.
   
    * Description from user's point of view -
       The Apache_HTTP_Stopped situation and custom situations
       based on attributes from the TEP group "Apache Web Servers"
       results in multiple rows created for each web server
       instance. Normally we would expect to see one row per web
       server instance, but we actually see a multiple by the
       number of web sites present for all the web server instances
   
       i.e. if there are two web server instances each running 3
            websites, we see 6 rows per web server instance instead
            of 3  using the default Apache_HTTP_Stopped situation
            the additional rows are not exposed to the TEP when the
            situation fires and we correctly see one alert per web
            server.
   
   
       If the option "Display Item" (found under Advanced Situation
       Options in the situation editor) is set to "Web_Server_Name"
       and only one of the web server instances is not running, we
       see multiple alerts generated. This includes for web servers
       that are known to be running also sent to the TEP, resulting
       in false alerts.
       This behaviour is seen because of the multiple rows created
       at the TEMA
   
    ---------------------------------
   Users Affected:
       KHT 7.1 users monitoring Apache or IHS.
   
    ---------------------------------
   Approvals:
   
   L2:  IS
   L3:  AB
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Situation will be displayed properly,
   In the situation in the Advanced options,
   if "Display Item" in Advance Situation Option is set to
   <none_selected>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM for HTTP agent users, monitoring
   * multiple Apache or IHS web servers with the same KHT agent.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Multiple situation Apache_HTTP_Stopped
   * rise when one of the servers stops.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update agent to 7.1.0.2 LA12 or newer.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Each situation sample contained data for all servers, then
   situation condition was met on each web server, if any of them
   was stopped.
