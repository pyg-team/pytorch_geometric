APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the queueManager name parameter is blank in the WebSphere
   Application Server (WAS) Connection definition, MDB processing
   slows down.  Under heavy load, input queues back up and
   throughput decreases.  The SDSF Enclave display and the
   DISPLAY,WORK,MDB modify commands show only eight to twelve MDBs
   in process, even though the input queue has hundreds of
   messages. Each servant has opened the queue for input in all 35
   defined threads, but there are not more than twelve threads
   active at a time.
   .
   The Control Region (CR) and Servant Regions (SR) are doing
   frequent I/O to SQCSAUTH and the library where CSQBDEFV defines
   the default queue manager name.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Code a queue manager name in the WAS connection definition
   rather than leaving queueManager blank.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Problem Summary:
   A Queue Connection Factory names the Queue Manager which happens
   to be the default QM. With this configuration, MDBs process
   messages at an acceptable rate. However, if the QM name is
   removed from the QCF, MDBs process messages at a slower rate.
   The JMS code optimizes QM connection processing if a QM is
   named in the QCF, but does not if the QM name is blanks.
   
   
   Problem Resolution:
   The JMS code has been changed to also work with a blank QM name.
   
   This fix changes the Java component of MQ, and will be
   included in FixPack 6.0.2.4 (PK58458 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK58458]).
