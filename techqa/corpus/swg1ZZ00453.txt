APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Client has to perform various steps to keep the VIL operations
   running.  We have been running into many VIL issues.  We would
   resolve one and another one would pop up and resolve that and
   an issue we faced before pops up.
   
   Following are the latest issues we have been facing with VIL...
   
   16080,122,000 -- VIL "null' errors and vil-cloud-delete on one
   region deleted a different region
   
   We were able to resolve, to a point, various issues by running
   vil-cloud-delete/create for few regions, but with this, new
   issues, which have been faced before, are seen:
   
   - Repositories are dropping off their location information
   often (i.e. Fairfield).  To get around this, we have to run a
   sync on the external repository that is missing the location
   information.  This resolves the problem temporarily until
   another external repository drops it's locations and we start
   receiving the null pointer exception during CS2 Repository sync.
   
   - The images don't show up in the VIL UI under CS2 repository
   in a reasonable time.  Sometime it takes two or three days for
   images to show up.  We should not have to do any manual sync
   process for images to show up.  This is preventing AT&T to
   register images in SCO for clients to use during their
   deployments.  AT&T is in the process of trying to accomplish
   the following projects but this issue is preventing them to
   move forward:
   
    - Add cent os images to every cluster managed by SCO.
   
    - Changing the current templates to add user support for
         disk extension (add a new mechid for disk extension) to
         address a security issue.
   
   - Extranet external repository is not added back.  We'll need
   to run vil-cloud-create to see if this resolves the problem.
   We have seen this constantly where external repositories are
   missing from the VIL UI and constantly have to run
   vil-cloud-delete/create to get them back in and even after
   that, the repository is not showing properly (takes days to
   show up, images not available, etc.) or impact other external
   repositories.
