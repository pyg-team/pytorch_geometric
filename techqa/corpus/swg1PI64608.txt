APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When submitting changes to an attribute managed by DOORS/CM as
   well as an unmanaged attribute, after the save the change to the
   managed attribute does not display. You have to re-open the
   module and select the RCR again to see the change.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Setup DOORS/CM via OSLC (It doesn't matter if you use RTC or
   Change)
   2. Create a module that contains an object with the Object
   Heading value filled in u
   3. Put this module under change control and have the Object Text
   attribute managed and the Object Short Text unmanaged
   4. Submit an RCR against this module and select it as the
   default to open the module in exclusive edit mode
   5. Modify the existing object from step 2 by adding text to both
   the Object Text and Object Short Text attributes
   6. Save the module
   
   Results:
   You should then see the integration go through the recording
   progress and when it is complete you will see a Recording
   Report. Now if you look at the object you modified, you don't
   see the change made to the Object Text. You should see these
   changes. Once you close and re-open the module and re-select the
   same RCR you will see the change that was made to the Object
   Text appear.
   
   This seems to be introduced after 9.6.0.1 since I could not
   reproduce it in that version. I saw the issue with both a 9.6.1
   client and 9.6.1.6 client.
