APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - When one or more commands like "TRUCATE TABLE with REUSE
   STORAGE option" or "AUTO or MANUAL REORG TABLE with RECLAIM
   EXTENTS option" i.e. commands which perform a "reclaim extents"
   operation are executed on an MDC table while an online backup is
   in progress,
   DB2 frees those extents for the table, but the operation is not
   logged correctly.
   The backup completes successfully.
   
   - Restore of this backup is also successful.
   
   - When the Rollforward is executed, DB2 tries to replay a
   "create new block" operation in logs for the table in question
   and fails with following error as these extents are no more
   available, they were already freed .
   
   db2diag.log will have LEVEL: Error message:
   
   FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, buffer pool services, sqlbExtendObject,
   probe:650
   MESSAGE : ZRC=0x8402001A=-2080243686=SQLB_EMP_MAP_INFO_END "EMP
   MAP INFO END"
   
   The fix will ensure that the "reclaim extent" operations run
   during backup are logged correctly so replay during rollforward
   will not fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, please avoid running the following when there
   is an online backup in progress:
   
   1) TRUCATE TABLE with the REUSE STORAGE option on an MDC table
   2) REORG TABLE with the RECLAIM EXTENTS option (AUTO or MANUAL)
   on an MDC table
