QUESTION
 How do you perform a clean uninstall of IBM® Rational® Functional Tester (RFT) version 6.1.x on Microsoft® Windows®? 

CAUSE
The information in this document applies for both integrated development environments (IDE) of RFT. The IDEs are Java™ Scripting in Eclipse, and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, the latter in both versions 2003 and 2005. 

A clean uninstall removes everything that the installation procedure added. In case of installation or update failure, a clean uninstallation and reinstallation can result in a working RFT installation. 

 

Note: This information is valid for versions 6 only.

Uninstallation of RFT

Uninstallation of the IBM Rational Agent Controller

Re-installing RFT









Verifying the prerequisites  1. Ensure that no RFT IDE is running. 
 2. If you use .NET scripting, make sure, that you had installed one of these two combinations before the installation of RFT:  1. .NET 1.1 Framework with Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 
     2. .NET 2.0 Framework with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
    
    
 3. If you use Java Scripting for RFT, .NET Framework is mandatory. version 1.1 or 2.0 is required. 
 4. End all RFT processes. Use the tool Process Explorer from Microsoft Windows Sysinternals [http://www.sysinternals.com] and follow the steps below:  1. Find processes by DLL substring rtx  1. Select Find > Find Handle DLL. The Process Explorer Search window opens.

    C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\RFT\UninstallRFTRMT. 
    Note: You do not have to run it when you do not have this file. 
 3. Remove files under C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational. 
 4. Remove files under C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\IBM\rationalsdp6.0. 
 5. Clean all the assembly entries. Follow either method 1 or method 2.  1. Method 1: through Assembly Explorer:  1. Go to Start > Run and type assembly. 
         2. Delete all instances of the following:  1. rtxftnet 
             2. SiebelDomainProxies 
             3. SiebelIEHelper 
             4. SiebelNotificationListener 
             5. policy.6.1.rtxftnet[</code>]
            
            
        
        
     2. Method 2: by using gacutil and regasm .NET commands:  1. Go to: Start > Programs > Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (or 2005) > Visual Studio .NET Tools > Visual Studio .NET 2003 (or 2005) Command Prompt. 
         2. From the command prompt, to remove from Global Assembly Cache (GAC) enter the commands below:  1. gacutil /u "<path>\rtxftnet.dll" 
             2. gacutil /u "<path>\SiebelDomainProxies.dll" 
             3. gacutil /u "<path>\SiebelIEHelper.dll" 
             4. gacutil /u "<path>\SiebelNotificationListener.dll" 
             5. gacutil /u "<path>\ policy.6.1.rtxftnet.dll"
            
            
         3. From the Command Prompt, to unregister the Assembly, enter the commands below:  1. regasm /unregister "<path>\rtxftnet.dll" 
             2. regasm /unregister "<path>\SiebelDomainProxies.dll" 
             3. regasm /unregister "<path>\SiebelIEHelper.dll" 
             4. regasm /unregister "<path>\SiebelNotificationListener.dll" 
             5. regasm /unregister "<path>\ policy.6.1.rtxftnet.dll"
            
            
        
        
    
    
    

 * Note:
 * 
 *  Open the Windows Registry editor. Search for all assemblies listed in Step 5 that you were unable to delete. Delete the entries from the Registry. Go back to Step 5 and try to delete the assembly entries once again. This time you should be able to delete them. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rational Software\RationalTest and delete the entire 8 Folder under it.
