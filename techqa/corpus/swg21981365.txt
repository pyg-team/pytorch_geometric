Title: IBM Rulerunner creating multiple batches with IBM Datacap - United States

Text:
cannot change status vscan queue TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When configured to run VScan and there are no images to ingest, Rulerunner keeps creating new batches instead of reusing the existing batch. The Taskmaster Server (tms) log shows:

Cannot change status from 'VScan' 'running' to 'VScan' 'pending' on queue entry 123 

CAUSE
With improvements made to database communications in 9.0, on more powerful servers it is possible to overdrive Access databases. This can result in batches not yet having been set back to pending by the time that Rulerunner is polling the database again for an available batch.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use a database other than Access for the engine database. Datacap supports SQL, DB2, and Oracle. Note that Access should not be used for any database in a Production environment.
