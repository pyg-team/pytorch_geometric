QUESTION
 We have upgraded from WDI 3.2 to WDI 3.3 on z/OS. We would now like to decommission WDI 3.2. Do you have a process in place to do that or will dropping EDIDB32E and it's STOGROUP be enough? 

ANSWER
There are no specific set of instructions provided in the current documentation. However, you are on the right track. One step would be to drop EDIDB32E and its STOGROUPs. Note that there are two different STOGROUPs; EDISG321 and EDISG322. And free the plan(s); EDIENU32 is the default plan name for batch WDI processing and DIENU32C is for CICS. This would take care of the DB2 side of things. There would also be the SMP/E Distribution and Target libraries. A list of these can be found in Table 3 on page 9 of the Installation Guide [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/integration/wdi/library/doc/wdi_32/pdf/wdiyai00.pdf]. But, of course, you do not want to remove any of the EDI.SMP* datasets which may also contain WDI 3.3 elements. That is, do not delete these if you used the same CSI and other EDI.SMP* datasets also for installing WDI 3.3 for z/OS. By the way, the FMID for WDI 3.2 is H28N320. The FMID for WDI 3.3 is H28N330.
