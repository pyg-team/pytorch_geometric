   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048751 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048751]
   PO05190, WorkItem:107741 - Form instructions for multiple
   pop-up search widget is insufficient for screen reader users.
   Previously the form instructions for multiple pop-up search
   widgets was insufficient for screen reader users. This meant
   that it was unclear to a screen reader user that selecting a
   value in the associated dropdown field was mandatory in order
   to successfully complete a search. This has been resolved by
   adding sufficient form instructions to the widget.
