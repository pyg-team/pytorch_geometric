APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The RTC plugin for RDZ currently causes any changes to other
   installed custom plugins to fail.  This was a problem for RSA as
   well, but was limited to the P2 based install of the plugin (we
   got around this by  using the IM based installation of the
   plugin).  However, this work around does not work for RDZ
   version 8.0.3.  Both types of  installations cause this issue
   for RDZ.
