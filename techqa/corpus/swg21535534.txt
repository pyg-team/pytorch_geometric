PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 7.x Java 1.3.1_09 1.4.2_03 plugin issue, configurator launch / console not coming up, JVM.DLL missing .dll error, IE Crash, JRE directory, plug-in cannot be located because values in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 

SYMPTOM
User is experiencing Java plugin issues when loading the Yantra console or configurator. Sometimes even after installing the Plugin, when you bring up the Configurator, it will crash IE

User getting an error message about being unable to find a .dll associated with a jre.

User getting a message 
"Java Plug-in 1.3.1_01 cannot be located because values in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Plug-in\1.3.1_01 is not found or is no longer valid"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These are the steps which helps to correct any general plugin issues. 

1> Ensure that you have installed the correct plug-in which is specified by Yantra. [look in the installation guide] , If there are no issues when launching Yantra this is all set. 
For Yantra 7.3 the valid plugin would be 1.3.1_09
For Yantra 7.5 the valid plugin would be 1.4.2_03 (We know problems where Config did not launch with 1.4.2_11)

2> If you have problems where the system repeatedly tries to download the plugin, refer to Solution 14600
If you do not have access to the Internet, and you have the plugin downloaded to a local intranet/WAN directory set the yfs.proprrties entry correctly
#yfs.config.java.plugin.codebase=

3> If you have successfully downloaded and installed the Plugin, but you are still having conflicts, and not able to launch the console/configurator. then this could be a problem caused by an entry in your Windows PATH variable, which points to a jre directory that is an earlier version. (In particular, if you install oracle client software, chances are you will have the jre installed under the oracle directory in the PATH variable).
Correct the PATH variable as outlined in the example below.

Example to resolve the Issue with the System paths when the system picksup a wrong JRE 

FIXES to Path
=============
Delete those paths containing the word "jre".

Original path
C:\oracle\ora92\jre\1.4.2\bin\client;C:\oracle\ora92\jre\1.4.2\bin;C:\or acle\ora92\bin;C:\Program Files\Oracle\jre\1.3.1\bin;C:\Program Files\Oracle\jre\1.1.8\bin;C:\PROGRAM FILES\THINKPAD\UTILITIES;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System3 2\Wbem;C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI Control Panel;C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files;%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\Python22;C:\Yantra\Yantra7x\bin

New path
C:\oracle\ora92\bin;C:\PROGRAM FILES\THINKPAD\UTILITIES;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System3 2\Wbem;C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI Control Panel;C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files;%SystemDrive%\IBMTOOLS\Python22;C:\Yantra\Yantra7x\bin


4> If this still did not solve the problem, It is recommended you clean up all the JRE by un-installing them and restarting the system, if required. Verify that the windows registry is cleaned up, open the registry by regedit and Look for any entries of JRE and delete them via Windows Control Panel. [User should never attempt the regedit since modifications without knowledge of registries keys could make the system unusable]. 


Note : You are also recommended to uninstall the JRE only by Add/Remove Programs from the control panel , but not by deleting the installation directory directly. 
Also ensure in that SYSTEM PATH that you have the java/jre path entry at the start of the SYSTEM PATH 


5> If none of this helps, As a last resort, you can edit the registry and make the following changes. Please note this needs to be done ONLY by a superuser who is familiar with registry modifications. 

Sample Reg edit 
FIXES to Registry [ version of JRE to use is dependent on the yantra version you are installing - refer yantra installation guide]
=============
1. Run 'regedit' from command prompt
2. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Plug-in\
3. Create 1.3.1_01 as key 
4. Under 1.3.1_01 create New-> Binary Value as JavaHome
5. Modify and give value as C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1_09
