ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you add a namespace that uses a different prefix but the
   same namespace as another entry, and then you use that prefix in
    an assign transformation with a cast of the item, you receive
   the following exceptions in an XML Map that uses XSLT 2.0:

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Integration Designer V8.0.1.2, any prefix that has a matching
    namespace as a prefix in the excluded list is also excluded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for Integration Designer V8.0.1.2 that stops
   the prefix from being added to the excluded list if the prefix
   namespace also matches another prefix namespace.
