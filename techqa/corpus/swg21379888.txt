Title: IBM Supported IBM and third-party software with TXSeries for Multiplatforms 7.1 on Sun Solaris - United States

Text:
 NEWS

ABSTRACT
 The following table lists the IBM and third-party software supported for use with TXSeries for Multiplatforms 7.1 on Sun Solaris. 

CONTENT

This page provides information about the levels of IBM and third-party software that run with TXSeries 7.1. However, since every possible combination of products cannot be tested, we suggest that you also contact the third-party vendor to verify that a particular product is supported for use with TXSeries. Maintenance levels listed below are minimum levels. TXSeries is not tested with every maintenance level of every product; we generally assume vendors do not cause regressions in their patches/SPs/FPs/CSDs/PTFs. If you use later maintenance levels and experience problems, please test with the levels specified below before contacting your IBM support representative.

Products that do not appear in the following tables have not been tested with TXSeries 7.1. TXSeries is periodically tested with additional third-party products and the information in this page is updated accordingly.

TXSeries is a 32-bit product. All libraries linked with TXSeries must be 32-bit libraries. Most vendors offering 64-bit versions of their products provide 32-bit client libraries. On 64-bit UNIX operating systems, TXSeries runs in 32-bit compatibility mode where support is noted in the operating system entry in the table below.

Note


 * Since interaction between releases of operating systems, software products, and TXSeries is very complex, information on this page can possibly conflict with information that is provided by product vendors. If you notice such an inconsistency or if you experience unanticipated problems, consult your vendor's product support and notify your IBM support representative.

 * IBM recommends that you maintain your TXSeries system environments at the latest fix pack level. See TXSeries for Multiplatforms support policy statement [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663762] for more details.
