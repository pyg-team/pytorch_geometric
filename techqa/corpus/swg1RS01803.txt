APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When debugging a Decision Service Project with a DVS Excel
   file, all the breakpoints that I have added in the rules are
   ignored.
   The DVS execution run fine, the report is correct.
   The rules are properly fired.
   
   Execution without using DVS works fine, all the break points
   will properly stop the execution.
