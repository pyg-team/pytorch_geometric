LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The CORBA BAD_TYPECODE exception, is thrown when the specified
   typecode is invalid. The issue seen by the customer is because
   of, the application code is invoking operations on the recursive
   TypeCode before it has been embedded in the enclosing TypeCode,
   and hence it results in a BAD_TYPECODE exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR13
   .
   In Java 142:
   The issue can be resolved by Synchronizing the getTypeCode
   Method, which will in turn ensure that the get() call on HashMap
   is Synchronized.
   In Java 50 & Java 60:
   We have ported the fix from the 626 line where
   conconcurrenthashmap is used to store the typecode which has
   synchronised get and put.
   As there is no concurrenthashmap in 142, we have used a simple
   hashmap and synchronised get and put calls.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20110815 or later
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Please see APAR IV13379 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV13379] for a complete fix to this issue.
