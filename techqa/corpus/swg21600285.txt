QUESTION
 How to collect diagnostics for SMC Switch problems in a Balanced Warehouse System or IBM Smart Analytics System 

CAUSE
Problems with the switch 

ANSWER
To analyze problems with SMC Switches in a Balanced Warehouse System also known as BCU or IBM Smart Analytics System the following diagnostics are necessary: 

 1. Connect to the switch via a telnet session. 
    The IP address for the switch is most likely 172.16.10.1 and 172.16.10.2 
    The default userid and password is admin/admin if this has not been changed.
    If you want to log the output of your telnet session you can do the following:
    telnet -f switchlog1.txt 172.16.10.1
    telnet -f switchlog2.txt 172.16.10.2
    
    
 2. Collect port configuration:
    show running-config
    
    
 3. Collect version info:
    show version
    show system 
    
    
 4. Collect the logs:
    show log flash
    show log ram
