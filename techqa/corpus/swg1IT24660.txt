APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I just received results from a CoalFire Pen Test and it was
   found that when using SSP as a reverse proxy people are able to
   do a ssh user@sgscert.tsysacquiring.net and receive the key and
   provided a login. Now even though our AUTH method is key then
   password, no one is able to get in. Info Security would like
   some guidance as to plugging this hole as it seems it is coming
   from the adapter.
   Example: ssh user@hostname
   user@hostname's password:
   They are wanting to suppress the password prompt and they also
   wander why produce a password prompt if the key fails.
   The policy is set as "key and password"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 561821
   RJ/RJ
   Circumvention: Update to latest SSP Build
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The SFTP adapter presents a password authentication prompt, even
    if the key authentication failed when the authentication policy
    is "Key and Password".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now look for an adapter property "keyauth.reqd.before.pwdauth"
   set to "true" and shut down the session before password
   authentication if the SSH public key is not presented or if key
   authentication fails.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  SSP3432 iFix 0+ Build 235
