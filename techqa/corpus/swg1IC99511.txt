ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Restarting the WebService Proxy (WSP) will restart objects of
   same name regardless of the object being used by the WSP will
   restart object of the same name and could possibly change
   settings within the unreferenced object.
   
   An SLM policy of the same name as WSP will be restarted when the
   WSP is restarted, such as simply clicking apply.  When this
   happens the SLM policy, of the same name, will be restarted and
   possibly have settings changes or options removed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not have duplicate named objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A DataPower WebGUI customer editing a Web Service Proxy might
   change the settings of a SLM Peer group unintentionally.
   
   Fix will be available in next major releases.
