Title: IBM URL links in MIME messages display as plain text in Notes 8 Standard Configuration - United States

Text:
Lotus Notes 8.0 Standard Configuration; mime; message; url; link; plain text; Notes Basic Configuration; mail; email; e-mail; click; display; view; client; program; generated; cannot; can't; preferences; BrowserRenderDisable=1; ie; internet explorer; browser; embedded TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
 

In Lotus Notes 8 Standard Configuration, you receive a MIME message with a URL link that was generated programmatically. The message displays as plain text and you are not able to click the link.

This issue does not occur in the Notes Basic Configuration and started happening when you upgrade to Notes 8 from an earlier release.


CAUSE
 

The embedded Notes browser is not able to display the links correctly. When the embedded browser is disabled, then links will display correctly. By using the System browser, the rendering of HTML formatted messages is improved over previous versions. 

If desired, you can disable this new functionality through a User Preference: "Disable embedded browser for MIME mail". This setting can be found on the "Basic Notes Client Configuration" tab > Notes Client User Preferences > Additional options section. 

Disabling this feature adds a parameter to your notes.ini file: "BrowserRenderDisable=1". Administrators can use the parameter to manage the browser configuration for users through a desktop policy.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This issue is fixed in 8.5.1.

Workarounds:
