QUESTION
 What type of help is available through a Problem Management Record (PMR) or Service Request (SR) opened with IBM PureApplication System, Workload Deployer, WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances, and WebSphere Appliance Management Center Support? 

CAUSE
Identifying the best IBM resource to assist with the specific needs of a customer is essential. The nature and scope of the issue should be considered in deciding which IBM resource is best suited for the task.

ANSWER
The focus of IBM Support is to provide timely problem resolution, relief or workarounds for high impact problems, investigation of possible product defects, quality fixes for product defects, and current information about available maintenance and installation information. 

 
IBM Support may refer you to product documentation or other publications or may be able to provide a specific response with short duration problems involving:

* Installation
* Usage (how-to)
* Specific usage/installation questions for documented functions
* Product compatibility and interoperability questions
* Technical references to publications, such as redbooks or manuals
* Assistance with interpretation of publications
* Providing available configuration samples
* Planning information for software fixes
* IBM database searches
* Feature enhancement requests

IBM Support is not structured to address every issue. The following are examples of areas that are out of scope for Support:

* Analyzing performance
* Writing, troubleshooting or customizing code for a client
* Answering extensive configuration questions
* Recovering a database, or data recovery
* Consulting

In the course of working with IBM Support, you may be directed to another more appropriate resource based on the scope and nature of the assistance that you require. For example, a customer who is thrust into a project without adequate training or who is tackling a newly emerging issue requiring a complex configuration design, debug, and test may be referred to IBM WebSphere Services, [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/services/] a fee-based consulting service. Our Services organization can review your request in the context of network environments and business solutions.

If you would like to propose that a new feature be added to the product in the future, a 
Request For Enhancement (RFE) may be filed for Product Management review. If you are
interested in proceeding with the RFE, please go to the WebSphere RFE Community [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/?PROD_ID=577] page. 
You will need an IBM user ID and password. If you do not have one you can register on the site and receive one. Complete and submit the RFE form.

Other areas best served by IBM resources other than Support would be broad configuration incompatibilities where an overall design needs to be revisited, training is needed, or best practices need to be followed. 

See the Appliance Support Handbook [http://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html]for the definitive reference on understanding the scope of IBM Support.
