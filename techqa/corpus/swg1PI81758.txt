   This fix adds support to CICS Batch Application Control
   to run with CICS TS V5.4
   
   The following documentation change will be made to the
   CICS BAC User's Guide as described below:
   
   Documentation changes to the CICS TS 5.4 Knowledge Center
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   In the CICS TS 5.4 Knowledge Center;
   CICS Batch Application Control for z/OS V1.1.1;
   User Guide ->
   Implementation and customization ->
   Setting up and starting the CICS component ->
   Preparing CICS regions for CICS BAC ->
   CICS BAC program and mapset definitions;
   in the notes below Figure 4 "CEDA commands to define the CBK
   programs and mapset in your CSD":
   
   Additional text is added to note 1.
   At the end of the second sentence, add the following text:
   
   "or 71 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.4 region."
   
   The note should now read:
   
   1. In the CEDA commands shown in Figure 4, replace cbkgroup with
   any character string allowed by the CEDA transaction that meets
   your installation standards. Replace the nn in the program names
   CBKFSXnn and CBKSPXnn with 53 if you are installing CICS BAC in
   a CICS TS 1.3 region; 62 if you are installing CICS BAC in a
   CICS TS 2.2 region; 63 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS
   TS 2.3 region; 64 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS
   3.1 region; 65 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 3.2
   region; 66 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.1
   region; 67 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.2
   region; 68 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.1
   region; 69 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.2
   region; 70 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.3
   region; or 71 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.4
   region.  You can also define the programs for all these CICS
   releases if you want to.
   
   1. This PTF adds 2 new load modules to the SCBKLOAD library.
      Before applying the PTF you should ensure that the SCBKLOAD
      library has at least 18 directory blocks.
   
   2. There are two new programs CBKFSX71 and CBKSPX71 for which
      program definitions are required in the CICS region where
      CICS BAC runs.
      The resource definitions for these programs are in member
      CBKPROGS in the SCBKSAMP library.  They are marked with the
      APAR number PI81758.
      Please ensure that you add these additional resource
      definitions to your CICS system.
      Although these new programs and definitions are only
      required in a CICS TS 5.4 environment, you are advised to
      add the definitions to CICS regions running other releases
      of CICS TS so that they will be available if and when you
      migrate the regions to CICS TS 5.4.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS Batch Application Control base code has been enhanced to
   run with CICS TS V5.4.
