ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to synchronize using the GTS SCM Copy wizard when
   adding new checks...get the following error:
   ***************************
   2/27/2015 00:03:14.622 [ERROR] ComponentLibrary.js
   BFRelevance Error: The operator "undefined" is not defined.
   onSuccess:
   relevance: (id of it as string & "|~|" & mime field
   "x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id" of it & "|~|" & id of site of it as
   string)
   of bes fixlets whose (((exists mime field
   "x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id" of
   it AND ((mime field "x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id" of it =
   "0aef61f6cb9b173134bb10e7e013de50" AND id of site of it =
   undefined))))
   AND not custom flag of it)
   2/27/2015 00:03:15.233 [ERROR] ComponentLibrary.js
   BFExternalInterface.callWithCallback: Error executing specified
   method.
   methodName: addChecks
   Error details: 'null' is null or not an object
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To do the following procedure:
   It appears that at least part of the problem is due to one or
   more duplicate analyses in site (the sync wizard assumes
   uniqueness of every analysis in a given site, based on their
   "x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id" MIME field.
   To test this, try running the following session relevance
   within the console's
   Presentation Debugger in the Debug menu:
   
   (ids of it, names of it) of (fixlets whose (mime field
   "x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id" of it = "enter
   x-fixlet-scm-analysis-id here") of all
   bes sites whose (name of it = "enter name of site here"))
   
   Delete all duplicates found from this and repeat until you no
   longer have the error by removing all duplicates.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: SCA users experience custom check
   synchronization errors.
   Problem Summary:  When attempting to synchronize custom
   checklists with the external checklist they are based on.  These
   errors are 'Unable to get value of the property '0'. Object is
   null or undefined' and/or 'Singular expression refers to
   non-unique object'
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  These issues are resolved in SCM reporting QA v.225 and SCA 1.6.
