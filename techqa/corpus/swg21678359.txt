Title: IBM Security Bulletin: ClassLoader manipulation with Apache Struts (CVE-2014-0114) and Denial Of Service vulnerability in Apache Commons FileUpload (CVE-2014-0050) affect IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.5.0 - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been reported for the Apache Struts 1.1 and Apache Commons FileUpload libraries shipped with one component of IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The vulnerable libraries are used only in an administrative user interface that, by default, is available only to one administrative user. Other usage of the same libraries in IBM Business Process Manager have been addressed by fixes detailed in the security bulletin links in the References section.
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0114 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0114] 

DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Struts might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by the failure to restrict the setting of ClassflLoader attributes. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter of an ActionForm object to manipulate the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code on the system.

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0050 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0050]

DESCRIPTION:
Apache Commons FileUpload and Tomcat are vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by the improper handling of Content-Type HTTP header for multipart requests. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker might exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90987 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90987] for the current score

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The vulnerable application is only required for IBM Support to gather additional information. By default, only a single administrative user (deployment environment administrator) can access the application. You can completely prevent access to the application by removing all users and groups from the Javaâ„¢ Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE) role mapping in this application. 
In the WebSphere Administrative Console, navigate to Applications > Application Types > WebSphere Enterprise Applications > IBM_BPM_DocStoreAdmin_<clusterName> > Security role to user/group mapping. Remove all users and groups from the role mapping.
