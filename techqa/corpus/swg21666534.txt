QUESTION
 Deployed SOA Application (ex: SDMS, TCORE). How can I tell if it is done successfully ? 

CAUSE
After the script configDMS ran, everything seemed OK, but needs to confirm if it actually was completed successfully or not.

ANSWER
 

Here are the steps to follow : 

1. cd C:\IBM\ITM\CNPSJ\bin 
2. Connect to the server by running the command line: 
wsadmin.sh -conntype SOAP -user xxxxx -password yyyyyy 

For example: 

 *  wsadmin -conntype SOAP -user wasadmin (<==when password is empty) 


3. Then enter command on wsadmin prompt:  *  wsadmin> $AdminApp list 


4. You'll get a list like this: 

wsadmin>$AdminApp list 
ITMREST 
KD4SDMS 
LICServlet 
OAL-API-Bean 
RedirectServlet 
TEPSRESTEAR 
ivtApp 
query 
wsadmin> 


5. Make sure that KD4SDMS (for SDMS) and OAL-API-Bean (for TCORE) exists. 
Those are the SOA applications
