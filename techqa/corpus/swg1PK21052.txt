APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are generating COBOL copybooks from a WSDL file using
   CICS Web services assistant DFHWS2LS and are using mapping-
   level 1.1.  The generated COBOL copybooks may contain some
   comments that extend beyond column 71.  This APAR is being
   taken to correct the formatting of the comment lines in the
   COBOL copybook that is generated.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually correct the comment lines so they do not extend
   beyond column 71.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DFHWS2LS generates COBOL comments that  *
   *                      extend past column 71.                  *

   ****************************************************************
   The Web Services Assistant DFHWS2LS is used to generate a COBOL
   data structure from some WSDL. DFHWS2LS adds comments to the top
   of the data structure describing the variables and the source
   XML. DFHWS2LS may generate comments that extend past column 71.
   
   This is due to an error in method MakeLang.splitLongLines when
   formatting COBOL comments to fit between columns 7 and 71.
   
   Additional keywords: WS2LS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The method splitLongLines in class MakeLang has been changed so
   that COBOL comments do not extend past column 71 in a generated
   data structure.
