ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the SQL Server instance is in a cluster the following error
   message will appear when trying to log in from the Search
   Configuration tool:
   Failed to connect to SQL Server due to the following error:
   A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while
   establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not
   found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is
   correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote
   connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 -
   Error Locating Server/Instance Specified)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround for this issue would be to create a SQL Server job
   in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
   
   To do this open the SQL Server instance that has the SQL Server
   agent that you would like to use. Expand the SQL Server agent
   in the object explorer.
   
   Right-click on Jobs and select New Job. This should open
   the New Job dialog.
   
   Choose any name and leave the owner. A description can be
   written, if you wish.
   
   Under Select a page go to Steps. Select New... at the
   bottom to add a new step.
   
   Give it a name. Change the Type to Operating system (CmdExec).
   Add a command line argument as made in (reference creating
   command line argument). It should have the following format:
   
   X:\Program Files (x86)\i2 iBase 8\i2.iBase.SearchIndexerExe.exe
   /iBaseDBName iBaseDatabaseName  /ServerName ServerName
   
   Press OK.
   
   Go to schedule and select New... This should open the
   scheduling dialog.
   
   Give the schedule a name and then and choose an appropriate
   schedule. Press OK. Press OK. This will have created a job that
   runs the Search 360 indexer on your specified database on the
   schedule that you have specified.
