Title: IBM Opening i2 Analyst's Notebook Premium Global Analysis Repository / Analysis Repository fails with an error message that it cannot be found - United States

Text:
GAR; SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While opening the IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook Premium's Global Analysis Repository (GAR) or the Analysis Repository (AR), the following error is displayed: 

The web service for repository instance <YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME> cannot be found at <YOUR_URL>.

You are unable to open or manipulate the Global Access Repository / Analysis Repository. 

CAUSE
IBM HTTP Server is configured to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 (TLSv12) or version 1.1 (TLSv11) but disallow TLS 1.0. Analyst's Notebook 9.x and Analyst's Notebook Premium 9.x run as 32-bit processes built and were written in Microsoft .NET 4.0. By default, .NET 4.0 supports neither TLS 1.1, nor TLS 1.2.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this problem, you may perform either of these two options: 

 * Create a 32-bit DWORD registry entry named SchUseStrongCrypto and set its value to 1, at this location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319 
 * Force IBM HTTP Server (Apache HTTP Server) to allow TLS version 1.0 (e.g., SSLProtocolDisable SSLv2 SSLv3 TLSv11 TLSv12)


NOTE: The registry change above applies only to Analyst's Notebook 9 and higher. Analyst's Notebook 8.x is architecturally incompatible with TLS 1.2 because its connector code contains .NET 3 and .NET 3.5 components, which are themselves incompatible with TLS 1.2, regardless of registry adjustments.
