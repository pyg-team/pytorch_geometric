 How do I configure and use the Confirm on Behalf Of functionality? 

ANSWER
Configuration To configure the Confirm on Behalf Of functionality you need to change the ALLOW PARALEGAL OR ATTORNEY CONFIRMATION Component. 1. Go to the Admin tab. Click on Components. 2. Search for the ALLOW PARALEGAL OR ATTORNEY CONFIRMATION Component and edit it. 3. Set the ALLOW PARALEGAL OR ATTORNEY TO RECORD A CONFIRMATION parameter to have a value of YES. 4. Save the changes to the Component. No restart is necessary for this change to take affect. Usage To use the functionality take the following steps: 1. Access a Matter that you are the Attorney or Paralegal for. 2. Go to the Hold Notice that was sent to the Custodian. 3. In the Notices Sent section click on the Recipients link for the Original Notice or last Auto-reminder for which the Custodian needs to respond to. 4. On the Notice Recipients Log List screen you will see a checkbox next to the Custodians for whom you can confirm on behalf of. 5. Click the checkbox next to the Custodian who you are confirming for. 6. Click on the Confirm button will be displayed in the top right. 7. Enter the reason describing why you need to confirm on behalf of the Custodian. 8. Click Apply to save the confirmation. Additional Info There are a couple of key points to understand when using this functionality: - This option is only displayed if the Hold Notice requires confirmation. - Only the Attorney or Paralegal directly assigned to the Matter will have the ability to confirm on behalf of Custodians who have been sent a Hold Notice for the Matter. - An Attorney or Paralegal can only respond with a positive confirmation for a Custodian. - If a response is already recorded, the Attorney or Paralegal will not see this option to confirm on behalf of the Custodian.
