ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Access Manager 5.1 on Windows2k (Did not test any other
   Operating Systems), user has the Policy Server configured for
   SSL to LDAP.  User decided to change the password of the
   password via the GSK7IKM utility and storing that password in a
   stash file as the previous password was stored.  When restarting
   the Policy Server, the application failed to start via the
   services control panel. (I also verified that it failed via a
   commandline start via the foreground).
   
   I was still able to open up the kdb file with the new password
   via IKeyMan and also LDAP was able to restart without any
   issues.
   
   When I went back into GSK7IKM and changed the password, saving
   it to stash, back to the orginal, the Policy Server started up
   successfully.
   
   I have reproduced all of this on my system in the Lab.
   
   I did one other test in which I changed the password of the
   am_key.kdb and then went into the config file of the Policy
   Server and added the line
   ssl-keyfile-pwd = <password>.
   
   This DID allow the Policy Server to start using the new
   password.
   
   I am guessing the problem is in how the Policy Server reads the
   stash file, or a caching problem in the Policy Server.
   
   Please review.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the conf file to specify the password using the
   ssl-keyfile-pwd = <password>
