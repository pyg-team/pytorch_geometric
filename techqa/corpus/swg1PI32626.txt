APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For the error message DNIP1822E the user response needs to
   point to WMQ, no longer to WMB, as broker subscriptions are
   handled via MQ starting with Broker  V7
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  M&C Doc change
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Formerly, the user response for message DNIP1822E
   asked to lookup a reason code in the WebSphere Message
   Broker information center. However, the reason code is
   a WebSphere MQ reason code and therefore must be
   looked up in the WebSphere MQ information center.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, this has been fixed.
