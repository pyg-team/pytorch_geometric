QUESTION
 What is the difference between Node-Locked and Floating Licenses in IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

ANSWER
A Node-locked License applies to a single PC running our software. A Floating License applies to several PCs running our software all connected to a server which has the license manager running on it. The license manager counts the number of users at any one time for the allowed number of Rhapsody clients.
