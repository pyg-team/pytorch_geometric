   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21291567&amp;aid=2] 
   
 * Deployer and Admin console authenticate against this geronimo-admin realm. The authenticating user should belong to admin group.

    * Using properties file.

 5. Click Add.



Using properties file  1. Browse to the location <wasce-home>/var/security and edit users.properties file.
    
    
 2. Add a new line of username, password pair (for example: john=secret)
    
    where, 
    john - username
    secret - password
    
    
 3. Save changes to the file.
