ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A customer wants to use WebSphere Edge Server Load Balancer
   version 6.1.0.42 to load balance multiple Tivoli LDAP servers
   with Cognos 8 apps on Websphere.??Customer is seeing the
   following issues only when using the LDAP load balancer:?-
   timeouts due to inactivity hang the browser and require a new
   one to be opened?- intermittently, it can take several minutes
   to login??IBM Webshere L2 and L3 folks has investigated and see
   that Cognos is using some sort of connection  pooling/reuse and
   that it is trying to use a connection that has been  already
   closed by the LDAP server for inactivity but since the
   connection is going through a VIPA, Cognos is issuing TCP
   retries until a new connection is established. This is the cause
   of our poor performance when connected to the LDAP through the
   VIPA but is an issue that can be addressed on the Cognos end of
   the equation by cleaning up the LDAP connections.   ??Questions
   posed by IBM websphere folks ?(1) Does cognos have a parameter
   to control how long it will let    ?inactive connections linger
   before cleaning them ? ?(2) If not, is there a   hardcoded value
   how long a connection can exist with no traffic before  cleaning
   ? If there is a hard coded value, LB needs for its
   staletimeoutto be set slightly higher than this hard coded
   value. If there is no   such control for cognos, there needs to
   be because connections can fail ?with no further traffic and if
   they aren't cleaned up, the connection   ?pool will be exhausted
   after some amount of time.??We know that Cognos do use
   connection pooling of default 20 for LDAP connection but we do
   not know whether the advance setting
   "unbindLDAPHandleAfterUse=True" will help in this case or if
   there is anything else that could help the issue of using the
   LDAP load balancer. Need also answers to the above questions.
