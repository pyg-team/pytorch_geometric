QUESTION
 How to run an SPSS Statistics v23.x production job from the command line on Macintosh OSX 10.10 Yosemite or higher without the need to start SPSS?

On the help system topic: Help > Core System > Production jobs, you find the chapter, "Running production jobs from a command line" with the following text:

"Command line switches allow you to schedule production jobs to run automatically at certain times by using scheduling utilities available on your operating system.

The basic form of the command line argument is:

stats filename.spj -production

Depending on how you start the production job, you might need to include 
directory paths for the Statistics executable file (located in the directory in which the application is installed). Or possibly the production job file."

On a Windows 64-bit operating system, you find the Statistics executable file (stats.exe) on the default path for the installation:

C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23

But you are unable to find the Statistics executable file on your installation on Macintosh. Where is this file located and how to run the production job from a command line on Macintosh?


ANSWER
There is a Statistics executable file on Macintosh as well but not in /bin folder as the other SPSS Statistics program files are for Macintosh.
The stats executable file for SPSS 23 on Macintosh is on the MacOs folder (a subfolder of the Contents folder) of release 23 installation directory.

Open Terminal.app on your Mac you need to CD to MacOS folder:

cd Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents/MacOS

When you are in this folder on Terminal list, the content with ls -a:
You see the following:

StartXD.sh 
stats 
statsshlib.sh
spssLauncher
statsenv.sh

To run your production job from a command line, you need the "stats" executable file.

From the Terminal, you can run a command such as:

./stats /Users/SPSS/Documents/Test.spj -production

Whereas Test.spj is a production job file that is created in Release 23, the job runs a syntax that starts the Employee Data.sav from the SPSS 23 Samples folder. Frequency table for variable gender will also be created.

The output is exported as Test.spv from the production job to /Users/<user name>/Documents folder 
(in above example to /Users/SPSS/Documents where also the syntax *.sps and production job file *.spj are stored).
