Title: IBM KMQMQ212W Messages for CSQXSERV - United States

Text:
KMQMQ212 CSQXSERV ssidCHIN TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In my agent task for Omegamon XE for Messaging on z/OS I'm now seeing 
occurrences of the type of message: 
KMQMQ212W MQI handle translation failed. QMgr=xxxx, application=ssidCHIN, KMQMQ212W+ TRAN/PROGRAM=CSQXSERV. This may result in incomplete application queue statistics.
Can you tell me what needs to be done to stop these messages from occurring? 

ANSWER
There are some cases where KMQMQ212 will be issued and this is an expected condition that we will not be able to resolve. These conditions include: 
1)When the application terminates before we are able to process the MQ call and find the associated queue name. 
2)Internal WebSphere MQ application activity does not follow standard MQ call conventions and there are some cases where we may not be able to handle these calls. However, this is 
internal MQ activity that is beyond customer control so it does not need to be monitored. CSQXSERV program in ssidCHIN is one such internal program.
