Title: IBM All documents not being returned during full text search using "By Author" - United States

Text:
Full Text Search; search documents whose author contains; condition "by author" TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You attempt to do a full text search of your mail file, using the "By Author" condition, to find all documents sent by a certain person. You find, however, that not all the appropriate documents are being returned. 

If you search on just the user's name as a text string and not as a condition, all the documents that the user has sent are returned in the search. Also, if you search by the field "From" or other conditions, and enter a user's name, all the documents that the user has sent will be returned in the search. The problem seems to be limited to searching on the "By Author" condition.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was reported to Quality Engineering; however, currently there are no plans to address it. 


When doing a search using the condition "By Author", the search looks to the field $UpdatedBy. If the email author's name does not appear in that field, the document will not be returned. This is working differently than expected and can result in not all documents sent by an author returned in a search.

Workarounds:
- Use the "By Field" condition to search the "From" field for the name.
- Do not use a condition to search; instead, do a simple search for the name text.

Supporting Information:
If you full text index a mail file that has numerous emails from various users, and look at the $UpdatedBy field in the emails' document properties, you find that sometimes it will contain the email author and other times it will not. Many times it will contain only the names of servers through which the mail routed. Additionally, if agents have acted on the documents, the signer of the agent and/or the server name on which the agent ran will appear in the $UpdatedBy field as well.
