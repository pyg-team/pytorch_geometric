APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you click on the Fixed Storage Area "Retention" tab in ACCE
   in CPE 5.2.1, then ACCE will hang.  This happens for the
   following types of fixed storage areas:
   IICE
   Centera
   OnDemand
   Hitachi
   
   ACCE will display the Retention tab successfully for the
   following types of fixed storage areas:
   Atmos
   IS
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If you created the FCD/FSA in CPE 5.2, then the retention tab
   isn't the correct way to define retention, and the retention tab
   is not required. In this case, access the retention information
   via the document classes.
   
   IBM introduced a new class-based scheme for defining retention
   for fixed content in CPE 5.2.0, and this scheme supersedes the
   old scheme which is tied to the fixed content area (i.e. the
   Retention tab).
