APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to launch the Site Designing Portlet feature from the
   context menu of a WebSphere Portal v8.0 server results in error
   
   Problem:
   
   You may observe an error when attempting to launch the Site
   Designing Portlet for WebSphere Portal v8.0 server when using
   the default internal browser.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   --------------------
   1) Configure a local WebSphere Portal v8.0 server.
   2) Start the server.
   3) Once server has started successfully, from its context menu
   select 'Site Designing Portlet' feature.
   
   Expected results:
   ==================
   Site Designing Portlet should launch successfully; you should
   also be able to click on the 'Edit Mode' link to switch the Site
   Designing Portlet to edit mode.
   
   Actual results:
   ===============
   The following error appears:
   
   'TypeError: Object doesn't support property or method
   'setProperty'
   
   After closing the error, you will notice the Site Navigation
   Pane of the Site Designing Portlet never loads successfully.
   
   Also, if you subsequently attempt to switch Site Designing
   Portlet to edit mode (from view mode), you may get the same
   error pop-up, or RAD may even crash.
   
   Local fix:
   
   Do not attempt to launch Site Designing Portlet using the
   default internal browser.  Before attempting to launch the Site
   Designing Portlet, go to Window ? Web Browser and select to use
   a compatible external browser installed on the system, instead
   of the default internal browser.  The following browsers are
   compatible with the Site Designing Portlet feature, and must be
   installed on your system:
   
     * Firefox 3.6, or later version (NOTE: Internet Explorer
   browser will not work, regardless of whether you use it
   externally)
   
   Also, if you want to switch to 'Edit' mode, you need to ensure
   you are authenticated with the Portal site.  When you initially
   launch the Site Designing Portlet from RAD, you will see the
   'Log Out' link in the upper right-hand corner, which appears to
   indicate the Portal admin user is already authenticated, but it
   may not be.  You can click on the 'Log Out' link, then click
   'Log In' to ensure you are authenticated.  Once authenticated,
   you should be able to switch from 'View' mode to 'Edit' mode in
   the Site Designing Portlet.
   
   Optionally, you can configure the Portal server so that you are
   logged in automatically - from the context menu of the Portal
   server configured in the workbench, you can select 'Login
   automatically ? Enable...'.  Once enabled, you will be
   automatically logged into Portal for any action involving Portal
   design/administration.

   ****************************************************************
   CSS in the Portlet JSP was throwing exception while
   rendering the Portlet and auto login to portal was causing
   the issues in switching to edit mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It was a problem with style sheet in Portlet JSP and
   auto-login url to Portal.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in Rational Application
   Developer v9.1.
