QUESTION
 What does BP Recovery do exactly? 

ANSWER


BP Recovery 
Runs on a schedule (by default, every 45 minutes and on startup) 
Calls ‘Recover.BPML’ which is the service that actually does the work 
Handles processes that are either in error or still seen as active in the system when they are not (for example, after system restart) 
Made of these parts: 
BPReport Service: creates a list of processes to work on 
BPMark Service: handles the marking of BPs in the system to the correct status 
BPStart Service: restarts BPs marked to auto-restart
