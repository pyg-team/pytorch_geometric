APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  administrative users are unable to save files or create folders
   after
   upgrade to 2.0.3.
   
   Client's Document Classes Default Instance Security
   Owner  settings are set to a user other than Creator-Owner.
   When they change it
   to Creator-Owner, users can add content.  If it is set to
   anything other
   than  that, users cannot add content.  Client needs this to work
   as it did in
   2.0.2.   When Creator-Owner is set, it allows those users to
   change the security
   on the object, which can  disallow other users from seeing the
   Objects.
   
   
   Also it is important to note the following per client:
   behavior in question only happens when the client uses document
   templates that reference the doc class.  If they bypass the
   template and use
   the doc class directly, content can be added
   
   We also verified that items can be added using
   Workplace XT via a template.
