ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the following sequence of steps, when attempting to publish
   a collection plan where all the required criteria fields have
   values the following error is displayed "Cannot proceed with
   transaction since some of mandatory query parameters in
   Criteria tab has not been specified".
   [preparation]
   Create a collection plan template that is not associated to any
   data source from the Admin > Hold and Collection Templates. Add
   some criteria fields that will be required. I chose fields with
   various types: text, number, date, boolean.
   [reproduce]
   1. Create a new collection plan for a matter.
   2. When configuring the Plan Details set the following:
       - Data source = No Data Source
       - Template = <template you created>
       - Index By Custodian = <checked> + "Manually add custodians"
   3. Save the Plan Details
   4. On the Criteria tab, fill in all the criteria fields and
   click "Save".
   5. On the Custodian tab, add at least one custodian.
   6. On the Ownership tab, add at least one owner.
   7. Go back to the Plan Details tab. Click first on the "Save"
   button and then try to use the "Publish/Resume" button.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  First click away from the collection plan. For example go back
   to the Collection List screen or Matter Detail screen and this
   click back into the same collection plan. At that point when
   you click "Publish" it will publish the plan without the error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Clicking Publish on a newly saved collection plan, you see an
   error message that mandatory query criteria is not specified,
   even though the collection plan is complete and valid. The
   problem was due to obsolete session data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.6.
