 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logins to FileNet Content Engine clients (Workplace, Workplace XT, Content Navigator) are slow for some users 

SYMPTOM
Logins to FileNet Content Engine clients (Workplace, Workplace XT, Content Navigator) are slow for some users. Other user accounts login quickly.


CAUSE
Content Engine LDAP authentication is handled by the application server hosting it. 
Weblogic application server will retrieve a set of groups associated with the user account during authentication; the scope of this retrieval can impact login.

ENVIRONMENT
Any OS, any LDAP directory service, Weblogic application server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If some user accounts are consistently slower logging in across multiple client applications, there is a strong possibility that this issue is related.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Examine the directory service provider details in the Weblogic admin console. Under 'Groups', change the following:
Group Membership Searching: limited (default is unlimited)
Max Group Membership Search Level: 0 (this restricts the search to direct groups only)
