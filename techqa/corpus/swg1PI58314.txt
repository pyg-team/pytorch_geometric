PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our knowledge centers monthly. The following
   Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the month_year
   update to the Knowledge Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   --------
   ID: PI58314
   Problem: To avoid fewer pmrs where customers using 3rd party
   JPA jars and getting the problems. Need to add a statement in
   knowledge center so that we can also avoid sending these pmrs .
   
   Resolution: Topic, Using third-party persistence providers, is
   updated as follows:
   Add an AVOID TROUBLE note that says:
   Avoid trouble: Even though IBM supports the enablement of
   third party JPA run times to run on WebSphere Application
   Server, and ensures the successful deployment of applications
   that use such run times,IBM does not provide support for
   resolving JAR file conflict problems, or any problem that a
   stack trace indicates is in the third party code.
   
   The update also applies to V9.0
   ----------
   ID: 772810
   Problem: Calling getResource that begin with a forward slash
   (/) may return NULL if the JVM custom property
   com.ibm.ws.classloader.strict is set to true.  This condition
   needs to be pointed out in the knowledge
   center.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Java virtual machine custom properties, is
   updated for the com.ibm.ws.classloader.strict property with an
   Important note that reads:
   
   Important: Ensure that you use the resources that don't begin
   with a forward slash (/). The WebSphere Application Server
   class loader behaves consistently with the Java Underclassman
   by using this property, which prohibits getResource calls that
   begin with a forward slash (/).
   
   The update also applies to V7.0, V8.0, and, V9.0
   -------------
   ID: 772705
   Problem: In the following WAS 8.5.5 documentation we read
   about "Memory overload protection" that should be disabled by
   default:
   Topic: Configuring memory overload protection
   During a test a javacore was produced in which it seems the
   libHeapDetect64.so is loaded despite the fact no "-agentlib"
   parameter was specified. The documentation needs to clarify
   this condition.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Configuring memory overload protection, is
   updated as follows:
   (1)AVOID TROUBLE note before the procedure now reads:
   Avoid trouble: To ensure that the memory overload protection
   is configured properly, the -agentlib parameter needs to be
   set in the Generic JVM arguments field. Specifying the
   -agentlib parameter is only required in WebSphere ??Applicatio
   Server Version 8.5.5.2 and earlier. For a version of WebSphere
   Application Server after version 8.5.5.2, the -agentlib
   parameter is always loaded and does not need to be set, even
   if the autonomic request flow manager (ARFM) is disabled.
   
   (2) the sentence just before this AVOID TROUBLE note is
   rewritten to read:
   Memory overload protection is disabled by default. Memory
   overload protection is enabled when the memory overload
   protection (MOP) value is set to less than 100.
   
   The update also applies to V9.0
   -----------
   209287 (RTC)
   Problem: Client had issue setting the startup wait time.
   PM91596 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM91596] added a new bootstrap.properties parameter:
   server.start.wait.time
   This bootstrap.properties parameter is not
   documented in the Knowledge Center and should be
   
   Resolution: Topic, Specifying Liberty bootstrap properties, is
   updated to read:
   Use custom properties to configure server start wait time.
   
   You can increase the server start wait time beyond the product
   default setting by adding the server.start.wait.time property
   to the boostrap.properties file. The server.start.wait.time is
   specified in seconds.
   
       Specify the server.start.wait.time property in the
   bootstrap.properties file. The following example sets the
   server start time to 25 seconds.
   
       server.start.wait.time = 25
   
       This setting means that as the server starts, the
   reporting mechanism for the server attempts to report on the
   completed stages of the start. If the reporting mechanism for
   the server cannot perform its function within 25 seconds, an
   error 22 occurs.
   
       If you do not add the server.start.wait.time property to
   the bootstrap.properties file, the default server start wait
   time is internally set to 30 seconds.
   
   This update also applies to V9.0
   -----------
   ID: 772734
   Problem:Topic, Configuring port settings, is missing
   information about configuring to set port numbers in a
   different port range so that they cannot conflict.
   Resolution: Topic, Configuring port settings, is update to add
   a third optional step that reads:
   Optional: Set port numbers in a different port range so that
   they cannot conflict.
   
   WebSphere Application Server cannot always detect port
   conflicts when multiple installations are present on multiple
   hosts. To set port numbers in this situation so that you avoid
   port conflicts, adjust the starting port numbers of each
   installation to be in a different range from the other
   installations.
   
   For example, in a system with two installations, you can
   configure one installation to use the default port number
   settings, and manually assign a different port range in the
   second installation.
   
       Create the deployment manager of the second installation
   by using the manageprofiles command. On the -startingPort
   option, set a starting port number that is out of range of any
   ports that other installations use.
   
       bin/manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName Dmgr03
   -profilePath
       /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer_2/profiles/Dmgr03 -templatePath
       /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer_2/profileTemplates/management
   -startingPort 15000
   
       Create the application server or custom profiles on each
   target machine.
       Federate the profiles to the deployment manager by running
   the addNode command.
       Create clusters and cluster members from the deployment
   manager.
   
       New servers that you create inherit the higher starting
   port number from the deployment manager.
       Note: Node agents do not inherit the starting port number
   from the deployment manager. If needed, manually change the
   port number settings.
   
   Tip: You can use the Profile Port Checker tool to check for
   conflicts without needing to start the servers. Note that the
   tool checks only for conflicts on the machine where it runs.
   For information about using the Profile Port Checker, see
   Using the Profile Port Checker.
   
   This update also applies to V9.0
