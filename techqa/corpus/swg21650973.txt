QUESTION
 How do I upgrade InfoSphere Optim solution components to V9.1.0.4 (FP4) from previous versions of V9.1? 

ANSWER
To upgrade an InfoSphere Optim environment to V9.1.0.4 (FP4) from a previous version of V9.1: 

 1.  Review the detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024294] to ensure that you have the resources for the InfoSphere Optim V9.1.0.4 (FP4) environment. 
 2.  Export the definitions from the repository. To export the definitions:  1. Create a batch file in the %install_folder%\rt\BIN folder of a Microsoft Windows workstation, where %install_folder% is the folder in which Optim is installed. Use Export_Repository.bat as the name for the batch file. The code for this batch file is at the end of the page. Copy the code into the file and ensure that each pr0cmnd command is on a single line. 
      2. Ensure that the repository is running and is reachable from the workstation. 
      3. Run the batch file. Four export files and four log files are created in the %install_folder% folder.
     
     
 3.  Uninstall all components except for repository services and the repository from all computers. The export files and log files are not removed when you uninstall the components. 
 4.  Download the V9.1.0.4 launch pads from Passport Advantage. You must download the launch pad for Windows. You can download other launch pads for other platforms. The download instructions for each platform are in the following locations.
     Platform Download instructions Windows http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032874 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032874] AIX http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032877 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032877] HP-UX and HP-IA http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032878 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032878] Linux http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032875 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032875] Solaris http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032876 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032876] 
 5.  On a Windows computer, install the workstation components (the designer, the designer online help, and the runtime services) from the V9.1.0.4 launch pad. For information about how to install the components, see Installing InfoSphere Optim solution components [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/optsol/v9r1/topic/com.ibm.nex.install.doc/topics/opinstall_installation_overview.html]. 
 6.  Sign the Optim exit, configure the first workstation, and create an Optim directory. Use the Optim configuration program that runs at the end of the runtime services installation on the first workstation. For more information about how to complete these post-installation tasks on the workstation, see Post-installation tasks [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/optsol/v9r1/topic/com.ibm.nex.optimd.install.doc/topics/opinstall-c-post_installation_tasks_copy.html]. 
 7.  Configure and deploy the connection manager and its associated components (the manager, the service interface, and the servers). For more information about how to configure the connection manager, see Configuration roadmap for the connection manager, the manager, and the service interface [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/optsol/v9r1/topic/com.ibm.nex.install.doc/topics/opinstall_configuration_roadmap.html]. 
 8.  Import the definitions into the Optim directory that were exported from the repository. Run the Optim program (from the Windows Start Menu, click All Programs > IBM InfoSphere > Optim > Optim 9.1.0), click Utilities > Import, and import the four definition files into the Optim directory. 
 9.  Run InfoSphere Optim Designer (from the Windows Start Menu, click All Programs > IBM InfoSphere > Optim > Optim Designer 9.1.0) and use Directory Explorer to access the Optim directory. Upgrade the directory when you are prompted to do so. 
 10. Verify that all services were imported correctly. 
 11. Uninstall repository services and the repository from all computers, and install and configure additional workstations and servers as needed.
