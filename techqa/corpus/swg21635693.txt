Title: IBM OpenPages Reporting Framework Generation is Completing with Errors - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When launching the OpenPages reporting framework generation process, it is completing with errors. When clicking on 'Cognos Framework Generation' sub operation, why is the log showing: ERROR! java.net.ConnectException: Tried all: '1' addresses, but could not connect over HTTP to server?


CAUSE
The OpenPages application is unable to connect to URL and port utilized by the OpenPages Framework Model Service.

ANSWER
When an OpenPages 5.x administrator reviews the Cognos Framework Generation sub operation task, the log records: 

Cognos Framework Generation [OPENPAGES_DEFAULT]: ERROR! java.net.ConnectException: Tried all: '1' addresses, but could not connect over HTTP to server: 'myreportingserver.ibm.com', port: '9080' 

where myreportingserver.ibm.com is name of the reporting server and the OpenPages Framework Model Service is listening on port 9080. 

When an OpenPages 6.x administrator reviews the Reporting Framework Subprocess sub operation task, the log records:

Generating Framework Model, Facts and Dimensions, Custom Query Subjects. [DEFAULT]: ERROR! java.net.ConnectException: Tried all: '1' addresses, but could not connect over HTTP to server: 'myreportingserver.ibm.com', port: '8080' 

where myreportingserver.ibm.com is name of the reporting server and the OpenPages Framework Model Service is listening on port 8080. 

In most instances, the OpenPages administrator does not have the OpenPages Framework Model Service up and running on the reporting server. If the issue is occurring for a new installation, there could be a firewall blocking the connection. 

To resolve the issue, an administrator should start the service and verify that the application server can make a valid connection.
