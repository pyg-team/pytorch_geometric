APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Imports of XML manifests fail in the following scenario:
   1. import the XML manifest attached to the DTS once => should
   work.
   2. import it again => fails immediately (before asking if we
   want to preserve users or not).
   The error is "Error 457 - This key is already associated with
   an element of this collection"
   Find below a summary of the tests done by the customer:
   -------------------
   - I started using our DE_GCB_CCP3 application where I also
   added inbasket templates (and applied the template to one
   inbasket)
    - I exported my metastore -> no errors
    - I imported the definition again (against the same
   metastore) -> no errors
    - I imported a second time -> no errors
   - now I imported the xml export I got from Millin (the one
   where you saw the problems), using the option (do not preserve
   users) -> no errors
   - now I tried to import this xml a second time -> now I receive
   the error Millin also saw!
   - in fact now I cannot import anything anymore
    - I get the same error now even if I now try to import
   the DE_GCB_CCP3 xml - the one that worked fine before
    - I can even see the same error when I try to import an
   empty xml file (looks like the error is raised for some
   "preparation" task)
   -------------------
   This happens only with BPF Explorer 3.6.0-001 or -002, the
   same import works fine with BPF Explorer 3.6.0-000.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since upgrading to BPF 3.6.0-002
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : N/A
   Is there a workaround? : Yes, first convert the export
   manifest to a SQL script and run it manually.
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : Customer cannot
   import the BPF configuration from UAT to Production.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Yes
   By Who: CSS
   System configuration: BPF Explorer 3.6.9-001 and 002 on Windows
   2003 with SQL Server.
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. import the XML manifest attached to the DTS once => should
   work.
   2. try to import it again
   => fails immediately (before asking if we want to preserve
   users or not).
   Actual Results: The import fails with an error 457.
   Expected Results: The import should be successful
   Are there any similar or related Defects? none that I could
   find.
   What logs were collected and where are they located? no logs,
   but the export manifest is attached.
   Customer's Configuration/Environment : Citibank's environment
   BPF 3.6.0-002 + 1016 and 1017 (and 1018 soon) on Weblogic and
   MS SQL Server backend.
