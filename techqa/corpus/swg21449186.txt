QUESTION
 Tivoli EIF probe cache considerations 

CAUSE
The cache file is circular and is a disc based file, on rare high volume occasions the tail can be caught up to by the head and could cause an event corruption.

ANSWER
The tivoli eif cache is always used; when an EIF event comes in, it is written to cache on disc, then read from cache, sent on to Omnibus, and removed from cache (or the marker moved on).


The Tivoli EIF probe caching can be turned off to save time and prevent any overwrite problems in this eif section of the probe by setting in the tivoli_eif.props; 


BufferEvents: "NO" 


The Tivoli EIF probe has the Store And Forward (SAF) common feature, which allows inbound events to be stored locally, in the event of the object server becoming unavailable, and can be turned on by setting StoreAndForward on in the tivoli_eif.props file; 


StoreAndForward: 1 

For full details on SAF, see the related links section, it is recommended that SAF is considered for use in preference to the EIF cache. 

For circumstances where high event volumes are reached, switching caching off improves the event per rate considerably. 

For resilience the peer-to-peer common feature using a master and slave Tivoli EIF probe is the supported configuration. 

From version 11.0.5 onwards the cache usage has been discontinued.
