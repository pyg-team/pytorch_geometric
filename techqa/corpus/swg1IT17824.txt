APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A client application fails to connect to a queue manager with
   error AMQ9777: Channel was blocked.
   
   AMQ9777: Channel was blocked
   The inbound channel 'A.TO.B' was blocked from address 'abc
   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)' because the active values of the channel
   matched a record configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active
   values of the channel were 'CLNTUSER('.
   
   This error is reported when there is a usermap rule which maps
   CLNTUSER 'XYZ' to 'ABC' and when there is a addressmap rule that
   blocks all the address. Along with the above CHLAUTH rule,  when
   CONNAUTH and a client-side exit are used, MQ is unable to honor
   USERMAP rule. The CLNTUSER in this case is a MQCSP user.
   
   Along with the above CHLAUTH rule, when CONNAUTH and a
   client-side exit are used, MQ is unable to honor USERMAP rule.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users who use a client-side exit along with CHLAUTH and CONNAUTH
   rules.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When an exit is used in the client side (e.g: mqccred exit)
   along with CHLAUTH and CONNAUTH rules, IBM MQ was unable to
   assert the client user and hence was failing to honour a USERMAP
   rule.
   
   This resulted in valid user credentials being incorrectly
   rejected by the queue manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM MQ code has been updated such that it is able to assert the
   right user so that it could honour the USERMAP rule.
   
   Fix for APAR IT12825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT12825] has to be included along with this.
   
   To have the queue manager use this new behaviour, set the
   ChlauthEarlyAdopt attribute under the Channels stanza to 'e' or
   'E',
   e.g.
   
   Channels:
      ChlauthEarlyAdopt=e
   
   Note that setting ChlauthEarlyAdopt to 'e' or 'E' when security
   exits are not in use will have the same effect as setting it to
   'y' or 'Y'.
   
   APAR IT18052 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT18052] made further changes to the new ChlauthEarlyAdopt
   parameter and so it is recommended that users review the details
   of that APAR in combination with this one.
