Title: IBM Deployment Manager is not accepting updates. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer has setup their user profiles to point to a UNC path rather than C:\Documents and Settings (default.) They also have not given their customers modify permissions to the Program files directory.
As a result they are unable to receive updates from Deployment Manager. 

SYMPTOM
Possible error found in the spssemgr.log file (located under the users mapped directory.) 

Mar 19 2012 10:41:22 [Thread-8] WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - Cannot obtain alternate update directory because the product version cannot be determined


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Within the config.ini file found in C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Collaboration and Deployment Services\xxx\Deployment Manager\configuration, you will find the following stanza which controls the location of the user objects: 

# Specify SPSS Enterprise Manager specific directories for storage of Eclipse artifacts 

osgi.configuration.area=@user.home/Application Data/SPSSInc/Deployment Manager/configuration_DeveloperBuild 

osgi.instance.area=@user.home/Application Data/SPSSInc/Deployment Manager/workspace 

osgi.user.area=@user.home/Application Data/SPSSInc/Deployment Manager/user 

osgi.clean=true 

 

There is also another stanza within the config.ini that controls the alternate update directory: 

#alternate update directory in case installation directory is write protected 

ibm.alternateUpdateDir=${user.home}/Application Data/IBM/Deployment Manager 

 

Updating these stanzas to a location that all users have access, allowed the customer to write the needed files to a location on their system that had modify permission.
