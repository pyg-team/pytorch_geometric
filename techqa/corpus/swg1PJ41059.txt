APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a Workitem toolbar's edit mode, clicking OK caused the get
   next related options display as if they were selected. There are
   no functional issues due to this problem because only the UI is
   affected. That means even if you see the last two options
   selected by OK button, actually the get next function wasn't
   enabled.
   
   To reproduce this problem:
   -------------------------------
   1. Open a work item, click to edit work item toolbar.
   2. On "Toolbar Options" tab, make sure the last two "get next"
   feature related options are unselected.
   3. Click OK button to close the edit dialog.
   4. Click work item toolbar's "Edit Setting" menu to open edit
   mode again, now you can see the last two options are selected.
   But on work item toolbar, didn't show get next link.
   5. Click Cancel to close the edit dialog.
   6. Open edit mode again, you can see now the last two options
   are unselected.
