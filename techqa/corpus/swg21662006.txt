CVE ID: CVE-2013-6747 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6747] 

Description: A certificate chain presented by a Client or Server could contain a circular reference that will cause the chain building logic to loop which can lead to a program crash or hang due to memory exhaustion. 

The IBM GSKit is used if ClearCase on Windows platforms is configured to integrate with IBM Rational ClearQuest with communication over SSL (https). This applies to Base CC/CQ integrations using Change Management Interface (CMI) and to UCM-enabled CQ integration via OSLC. If your ClearCase deployment is not using these integrations with ClearQuest, or not using SSL with the integrations, then your deployment is not sensitive to this attack. The UCM-enabled CQ integration without using OSLC (SQUID) is not sensitive to this attack. 

The IBM GSKit is also used by CCRC WAN server (all platforms) when supporting SSL connections.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/89863 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/89863] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV/N:AC/M:Au/N:C/N:I/N:A/C)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions 7.1.1 through 7.1.1.9, 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.12, 8.0.0 through 8.0.0.9, and 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.2

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to upgrade to a fix pack of ClearCase that has a newer GSKit component that corrects these vulnerabilities. Please see below for information on the fixes available.

Client fixes (for Windows ClearCase clients meeting the description above of vulnerable configurations): 

 * Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 3 (8.0.1.3) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036983]
   
   
 * Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 10 (8.0.0.10) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036981]
   
   
 * Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 13 (7.1.2.13) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036979]
   
   
 * Systems running 7.1.0, 7.1.1: upgrade to Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 13 (7.1.2.13) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036979].
   Note: 7.1.2.13 inter-operates with all 7.1.1.x systems, and can be installed in the same way as 7.1.1.x fix packs.


Server fixes (for CCRC WAN server): 

Install GSKit fixes to IBM HTTP Server, if you use SSL on your WAN server. You need the fix for APAR PI09443. To upgrade: 

 * ClearCase release 7.1.x: Document 1390803 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803] explains how to update IBM HTTP Server for IBM Rational ClearCase WAN servers at release 7.1.x. Consult those instructions when applying the IHS interim fix or fix pack containing the fix, as listed in IHS security bulletin 1663941 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663941].
   
   
 * ClearCase release 8.0.x: Upgrade IBM HTTP Server to a version including the fix (see the IHS bulletin), or install the IHS interim fix. Consult IHS security bulletin 1663941 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663941] for the releases of IHS that contain the fixes, and apply the fixes relevant for your version of IHS.
