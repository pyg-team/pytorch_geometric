 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We reviewed V9.7 Knowledge Center (KC) pages but could not find any information about 
Fix Pack (FP) 10 nor FP11. Are there any new enhancements or chagnes to existing 
functionality for V9.7 FP10 or FP11 from FP9? 

ANSWER
There is no new enhancement or change to existing functionality for V9.7 FP10 and FP11
from FP9. Sorry for your inconvenience but V9.7 has been planned to End of Support(EOS)
September 30, 2017 as below and no further update for V9.7 KC pages accordingly when EOS
was planned.

* DB2 Version 9.7, End of Support September 30, 2017 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22001887]

As we could see below pages, it does not mention about FP10 and FP11 while FP1 upto FP9
as explained above.
