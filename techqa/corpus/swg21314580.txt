Title: IBM IDM Web Services - Uninstall Hangs After Reboot - United States

Text:
WS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the installation of IDMWS 4.0.0 is completed, the server needs to be rebooted. The setup will continue with the “Registering installed components” process. However, this process appears to be halted in the middle. You finally have to kill the process via Windows Task Manager.

To reinstall IDMWS again you have to uninstall IDMWS via Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. The UNINSTALLATION process runs, then stops responding. You have no choice but to kill the uninstallation process via Task Manager. 

Attempt to log on as a local admin user, stop IIS, or disable anti-virus... does not help. IDMWS can't be removed. 

SYMPTOM
The uninstallation process runs, then stops responding when uninstalling IDMWS, occurring after the IDMWS install hangs in a similar fashion.


CAUSE
This problem can occur because of shared memory space conflicts between Web Services dlls and Internet Explorer 7.

ENVIRONMENT
Internet Explorer 7

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Test uninstalling IDMWS through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. If this is the problem, then the uninstallation process will stop responding after running for a while.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
- Choose Add/Remove Windows Components from Control Panel




- Uncheck component “Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration”
- Uninstall “Windows Internet Explorer 7”
- Reboot server
- Install Internet Explorer 6 (do not install IE7)
- Reboot server
- Uninstall IDMWS successfully
