APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Conversation Sharing in an MQ Queue Manager object does not
   negotiate
   full duplex channel when the Queue Manager channel attribute of
   Sharing Conversation is set at 1.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users of the sharing conversation feature of MQ Queue Manager
   are likely to see this problem.
   
   If the negotiated value of sharing conversation between
   WebSphere MQ Queue Manager and WebSphere DataPower MQ Queue
   Manager is 1, the MQ connection is established via the legacy
   MQ protocol 'TSH' instead of the modern MQ protocol 'TSHM'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.9.
