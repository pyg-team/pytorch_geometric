The IBM Rational Installation and Upgrade Guide states:

To verify that the Rational ClearQuest Web is working: 

 1. On any Windows, UNIX system, or Linux client, start a supported Web browser. 
 2. Enter one of these Web address, where host is the name of the Rational ClearQuest Web Application server computer: 
    
    http://host/cqweb/login http://host:81/cqweb/login 
    
    
    Note: The Rational ClearQuest Server refreshes its internal list of database connections every 10 minutes. You can wait until the list is refreshed or restart the Rational ClearQuest Request Manager. 
    
    
 3. If the Rational ClearQuest Web Logon page does not open in your browser, check the network connectivity between the client host and the Rational ClearQuest Web Application server host by using a ping command. If the client host is connected, verify that the Rational ClearQuest Web services are running on that host. For more information about how to start the Rational ClearQuest Web services, see "Administering Rational ClearQuest" in the Rational ClearQuest Online Help.
