QUESTION
 Why are your XGS shared object policies replaced after installing DBSP 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.1.3 in SiteProtector 3.1.1? 

CAUSE
DBSP (Database Service Pack) 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.1.3 contain extra default policies and shared objects that are not needed and SiteProtector 3.1.1 changed the behavior of a stored procedure from the previous releases. The combination of this caused the custom shared object policies to disappear in the deployed policies after one of the above DBSPs are applied.

ANSWER
For customers that have not applied the DBSPs in question, new versions of these updates are released that correct the issue. If you have already applied these DBSP updates and are having this problem, there are two options to manually correct it.



Option 1


 1. Unregister the XGS appliance from the SiteProtector Agent Manager.
    
    
 2. Delete it from Agent view.
    
    
 3. Reregister the appliance with Local policies Overwrite SiteProtector group settings option selected.
    
    
 4. Once the XGS agent has been added back into SiteProtector, import the policies and deploy them to the XGS. (for details on this step, see the user guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETBF_2.9.0/com.ibm.siteprotector.doc/tasks/sp_pol_moving_agents_out_of_the_sandbox.htm] for details)
    


Note: XGS 5.3 Fixpack 1 addresses an issue with the SiteProtector Management policy in firmware 5.3 where the policy cannot be altered. This fix pack is available via Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]. 


Option 2 

 1. Expand the Shared Objects container in your policy repository.
    
    
 2. Export the previous version of each available policy to a location on the SiteProtector console machine. Ensure that the Created on date is before the DBSP update was applied. (For details on exporting and importing policies, please see the user guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETBF_3.0.0/com.ibm.siteprotector.doc/tasks/sp_pol_importing_or_exporting_a_policy.htm?lang=en-us])
    
    
 3. Import the shared object policies back into the Shared Objects container in the policy repository.
