ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are installing Amos 24.0  and wish to deploy it with
   Concurrent User Licensing.  The Amos installer deploys a Trial
   license upon install and you must use the License Authorization
   Wizard (LAW) to convert the Trial deployment to an Authorized
   User or Concurrent User deployment.
   
   When you attempt to use Concurrent User licensing:
   1) The LAW 'pings' the License Manager server first and returns
   an error, "The License Server is Invalid", because port 7 TCP on
   the
   License Manager server is likely closed.
   2) The 'spssprod.inf' file is never properly updated with the LM
   server IP address or hostname in the "DaemonHost" line, nor is
   the
   'lservrc' file containing the Trial license string ever
   commented out or overwrittten.
   
   To resolve these issues, you are forced to manually:
   1) Rename the 'lservrc' file so the local Trial license is no
   longer active.
   2) Edit the 'spssprod.inf' file and add the proper IP address or
   hostname of the license manager server to the "DaemonHost="
   line.
