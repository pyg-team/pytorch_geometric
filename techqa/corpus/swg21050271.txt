ABSTRACT
 The following table lists the IBM and third-party software supported for use with TXSeries for Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. 

CONTENT
This page provides information about the levels of third-party software that run with TXSeries. However, because every possible combination of products cannot be tested, we suggest that you also contact the third-party vendor to verify that a particular product is supported for use with TXSeries. Maintenance levels listed below are minimum levels. TXSeries is not tested with every maintenance level of every product; we generally assume vendors do not cause regressions in their patches/SPs/FPs/CSDs/PTFs. If you use later maintenance levels and experience problems, please test with the levels specified below before contacting your support representative. Windows operating system Service Packs are an exception to this general rule: please contact your IBM support representative if the Windows Service Pack you wish to run is not listed in the table below.


Products that do not appear in the following tables have not been tested with TXSeries 5.0. TXSeries is periodically tested with additional third-party products, and the information in this page is updated accordingly. 

TXSeries is a 32-bit product. All libraries linked with TXSeries must be 32-bit libraries. 

 

Note: Because interaction between releases of operating systems, software products, and TXSeries is very complex, information on this page can possibly conflict with information that is provided by product vendors. If you notice such an inconsistency or if you experience unanticipated problems, consult your vendor's product support and notify your IBM support representative. Software Windows Version Software Support Notes IBM CICS Transaction Gateway 2000
NT 3.1.3
4.0, 5.0 CICS -- XP 5.0 IBM CICS Universal Client 2000

NT 7.1
7.2
8.1 CICS/Encina Version 7.1 requires FixPak 3 when using the WebSphere Advanced to Encina Interoperability feature of Encina.

Version 7.2 requires FixPak4 to work with Windows XP

DB2 v8.1 requires FP 2.

TXSeries CICS customers are advised to re-compile their switchload files when moving to DB2 8.1.

Please refer to support flash 1112695 for important information on DB2 8.1 XA open string parameters for TXSeries Encina applications. XP 7.2
8.1 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21050271&amp;aid=1] IBM DCE for Windows 2000
NT 2.2.4 CICS/Encina Encina clients support the DCE slim client configuration. You must obtain and install the slim client software before installing TXSeries. For more information about this configuration, and other DCE-related topics, see the TXSeries 5.0 Release Notes at: www.ibm.com/software/ts/txseries/library/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/ts/txseries/library] XP 2.2.5 IBM MQSeries 2000
NT 5.2, 5.3 CICS/Encina Requires MQSeries APAR IC32221. 

MQSeries versions 5.2 and higher require use of Encina's "multiple associations" thread agreement.

See the release notes for more information on using Micro Focus COBOL, MQ Series and CICS together.

TXSeries Cobol applications need MQSeries 5.3, CSD 5 or later. XP 5.3 IBM Software Developer's Kit (SDK), Java2 Technology Edition for Windows 2000
NT 1.3.0 CICS/Encina Encina supports JDK version 1.2.2 when using the WebSphere Advanced to Encina Interoperability feature to interoperate with WebSphere Application Server 3.5.x. If you plan to use Enconsole to administer Encina, you must also install Java2 SDK version 1.3.0. XP 1.3.1_02 IBM Visual Age COBOL for Windows 2000
NT
XP 3.0 CICS Requires FixPak 2. Connections to databases using ODBC interfaces are not supported in a Transactional environment. XA is the only supported Transactional interface.

IBM Visual Age PL/I Enterprise 2000
NT 2.1 CICS Requires CSD 5. IBM WebSphere Application Server Advanced Edition 2000
NT 3.5.x
4.0 Encina -- Iona Orbix for C++ 2000
NT 3.3.2 Encina -- Iona Orbix for Java 2000 
NT 3.3.2 Encina -- Micro Focus Net Express COBOL 2000
NT
XP 3.1 CICS/Encina Note that the combination of Merant NetExpress COBOL, version 3.0 or higher, and Microsoft SQL Server does not support XA transactions. Due to this limitation, CICS synclevel 2 transactions and Encina-managed distributed transactions are not supported. In both cases, however, you can code a direct connection to the database and manage transactions to the SQL Server directly; all issues of distributed coordination between multiple databases are then the responsibility of the application. 

We are currently analyzing a potential bug when using Net Express COBOL, Oracle 9.2, and CICS. Contact your support representative for the latest information. Microsoft SQL Server 2000
