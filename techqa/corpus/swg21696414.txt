 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
How do Notes and Domino handle leap second insertions that occasionally occur to keep UTC aligned with mean solar time? 

ANSWER

As detailed below, Notes and Domino gracefully handle leap second insertions. As such, there is no action required for administrators to prepare for leap seconds.

Notes/Domino polls the OS once per minute to refresh its internal clock. So once a leap second is observed, any difference between the OS time and the Notes/Domino time will automatically be corrected within the minute, when Notes/Domino next polls the OS. 

Additionally, if the polling happens to occur at the exact time a leap second is recorded, Notes/Domino is capable of handling seconds values (hh:mm:ss) greater than 59 seconds, with no ill effect.
