PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region receives messages:
DFHSR0622 An attempt to overwrite the ERDSA has caused the abend which follows
DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task TCP in control
DFHKE1800 ABNORMAL TERMINATION OF CICS IS COMPLETE 

SYMPTOM
DFHSR0622 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsr/SR0622.html] An attempt to overwrite the ERDSA has caused the abend which follows
DFHSR0601 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsr/SR0601.html] Program interrupt occurred with system task TCP in control
DFHKE1800 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhke/KE1800.html] ABNORMAL TERMINATION OF CICS IS COMPLETE

CAUSE
Program check in Compuware module DBUGPCPA. CICS ends since the program check occurs in a module that is running under the main CICS terminal control task.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You examine a system dump on the DFHSR0601 [http://publibfi.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/dfhg4c00/1.87?ACTION=MATCHES&REQUEST=dfhsr0601&TYPE=FUZZY&SHELF=dfhasj00&DT=20070614214024&CASE=&searchTopic=TOPIC&searchText=TEXT&searchIndex=INDEX&rank=RANK&ScrollTOP=FIRSTHIT#FIRSTHIT] message and find that the running task is TCP CSTP.

The ABEND0C4 occurs in Compuware module DBUGPCPA on a STM instruction: 90ECD00C. This is because register 13 is pointing to "read only" or key 0 storage. In this case, it is pointing to module EYU9NA01.

You back up in the CICS trace and find that the TCP task was in the middle of processing a losterm error for a terminal attached to CICS.
