APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DB2 EDU first traps due to a SIGSEGV (signal #11), then in
   signal handler it keeps looping between "pdLogInternal" and
   "sqlm*" functions and never returns.
   This problem only occurs when running LOAD commands via
   routines, e.g. "ADMIN_CMD".
   
   Following symptoms can help you identify this issue:
   -- The trapped EDU never terminates (can be seen in "db2pd -edu"
   result).
   -- "FODC_Trap_XXX" directory created, trap file generated, but
   no dump files.
   -- In db2diag.log, no information for the trap.
   -- The correspoding application appears hung.
      The DB2 instance may also hang if the hanging agent is
   holding some latches being requested by others.
   -- The "db2pd -edu" result shows the EDU clocks up a lot of user
   CPU time.
   -- In the trap file, you may see "sqlmStopWaitTimeInterval" or
   "sqlmStartWaitTimeInterval" at the top of the stack trace.
   -- A series of stack traces for the apparently hung EDU shows
   movement and "pdLogInternal" and "sqlm* (e.g. sqlmStopInterval)"
   functions at the top of the stack.
      To get the stack trace of the EDU, you will need some OS
   utilities. For example, OS debugger or the "pdump.sh" SHELL
   script provided by IBM for AIX platform.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue can be avoided by not running LOAD commands via stored
   procedures such as ADMIN_CMD.
