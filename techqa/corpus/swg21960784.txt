Modules impacted:
- Pktcapd, SSL, Kernel, LACP, MSL, LMI, SiteProtector, java, openssl, tzdata, 
ntpd, openssh, krb, unzip

Known Issues:
- We are aware of issue 64948, where if you disable any protected interfaces
before enabling outbound SSL inspection, it will cause the SSL inspection to
not work. As a work around, re-enable the protected interfaces, re-enable
outbound SSL inspection, and then disable your desired interface.
This should allow the inspection to function correctly.
A fix for this is planed for a future release.

- Fixpack does not allow for rollback. If rollback is done and appliance is
then rebooted then the appliance will get into an unconfigured state. There is
no way to recover but to reimage the box or change to the secondary
partition.
Change to secondary partition:
a) reboot
b) choose none selected partition from the grub menu
c) press enter

Notes:
- After applying fixpack, a reboot is required for the changes made by the fixpack to apply
- Clear the browser cache on any browsers used to manage the appliance.
- If the Event Id GLGSY0038W appears in your System Events Event Log, then
the operating system is experiencing a temporary failure. However, the
appliance is still protecting your network. Contact IBM Support for
assistance.
