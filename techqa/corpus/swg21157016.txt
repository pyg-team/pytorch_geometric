PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you install CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS), your CICS region fails during initialization with messages:

DFHXS0001 An abend (code 0C1/AKEA) has occurred in module DFHXSIS 
DFHXS0002 A severe error (code X'0109') has occurred in module DFHXSDM 

SYMPTOM
The abend (abend0C1 abendAKEA) occurs even if SEC=NO is specified. Also, this could involve any security product because CICS uses DFHXSS as a common interface to external security.

The offset of the program check can vary depending on your maintenance level of DFHXSIS.


CAUSE
Linkedit failure for module DFHXSS due to unresolved external references.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The SMP/E output for the linkedit of DFHXSS contains the following messages: 

IEW2322I NAME DFHXSS(R) 
IEW2456E [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/iea2m8c0/10.3.248?SHELF=EZ2ZO213&DT=20110616164849&CASE=] SYMBOL IRRSMK00 UNRESOLVED. MEMBER COULD NOT BE INCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNATED CALL LIBRARY 
IEW2470E [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/iea2m8c0/10.3.262?SHELF=EZ2ZO213&DT=20110616164849&CASE=] ORDERED SECTION IRRSMK00 NOT FOUND IN MODULE


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do the following: 

 * Include the dataset containing module IRRSMK00 and any other modules causing unresolved references in your linkedit step. 
 * Run the linkedit of DFHXSS to eliminate the unresolved reference.


Module IRRSMK00 should be available as a base part of your z/OS environment in dataset CSSLIB. You can refer to your linkedit job to determine the fully qualified dataset name for the CSSLIB you are using. You should check the contents of your CSSLIB dataset to ensure that IRRSMK00 and other modules causing unresolved references are available. If the modules do not exist you are probably using an old version of the CSSLIB. APAR OW42992 [http://www.ibm.com/Search?v=11&lang=en&cc=us&en=utf&q=OW42992](2002) added this module as part of new function.
