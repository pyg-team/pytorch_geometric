PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere Business Integration Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications, version 4.6.3 and later supports Siebel 8.0. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications version 4.6.3 and later now supports Siebel 8.0; however, to support Siebel 8.0, you must take several actions: 

 1. Install fix pack version 4.6.3 to enable the adapter to support Siebel 8.0. 
 2. Upgrade the JRE used by the adapter to IBMÂ® JRE 5.0. 
 3. Apply Siebel Quick Fix 8.0 (20405) - QF [0008] by Oracle. 
 4. Import a .sif file 


 1. Install fix pack 4.6.3
    Obtain the fix pack 4.6.3 from the following link: 
    http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=695&uid=swg24003719 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=695&uid=swg24003719] 
 2. Upgrade the JRE used by the adapter to JRE 5.0
    Upgrade the JRE used by the adapter to IBM JRE 5.0. The following link provides instructions about upgrading to IBM JRE 5.0 manually.http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=695&uid=swg21265380 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=695&uid=swg21265380] 
 3. Apply Siebel Quick Fix 8.0 [20405] - QF [0008] 
    Because Siebel 8.0 has a defect (CR# 12-1JUG1BX) that prevents the adapter from working normally with Siebel 8.0, you must apply Siebel Quick Fix 8.0 [20405] - QF[0008] by Oracle. After installing Siebel 8.0, apply QF0008 to your Siebel server. After applying the quick fix, be sure to use the Siebel driver. 
 4. Import the ibm_audit.sif file
    Siebel 8.0 is large; therefore, the previous .sif files for Siebel 7.7, which are used to create IBM Events BC and IBM Archive BC can no longer be used in Siebel 8.0. A new file, ibm_audit.sif file, which contains the entire IBM Audit project is available for you to import. A sample written in eScript, Account.js, which demonstrates how to write Server Script for inserting new event records to IBM Events BC is also available.
