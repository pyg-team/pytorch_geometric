APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENV:
   TWS Version:   8.5 GA
      TWS Component: MDM
      OS:            Solaris 10
   
   Symptoms are seen from JSC and TDWC.
   
    JSC pop-up message when attempting to view jobs in the plan
    or alternate plan:
   
       Message GJS0002E
         The plan view cannot load.
         Reason: AWSJSY101E The Symphony plan
         operation "queryJobs" could not be completed
         because the requested Symphony plan object
         was not found. The internal error message is:
         "NO MSG:/opt/tws/TWS/Symphony,,RR,0,".
   
    TDWC pop-up message when viewing Dashboard:
   
       AWSUI0374E Unable to retrieve data from this engine.
   
    TDWC pop-up message when accessing:
       Monitor jobs -> All jobs in plan... -> Use selected engine
       -> OK
       Message:
       AWSUI0790E The operation could not be completed because an
       error has occurred while accessing the Symphony file....
   
   For both JSC and TDWC pop-up messages the same entry can be
   found in the MDM's WebSphere SystemOut.log:
   
       "...  000007d8 ConnException E   AWSJSY101E The Symphony
       plan operation "queryJobs" could not be completed because
       the requested Symphony plan object was not found. The
       internal error message is: "NO MSG: /TWS/Symphony,,,0,".
   
   The job query problem occurs after a rerun of a job is
   performed.  There are no other plan objects that are affected.
   There is no problem with querying plan jobs from the command
   line using conman.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increase and enable autotrace channel for eWAS java process at
   50 mb:
   
    Modify config file into <TWS_HOME>/trace directory:
      #for eWAS TWS native APIs
       channel 18:
              size 50m
       process java:
              chan 18
   
      Then run the following commands:
   
       ./atctl off TWS all
       ./atctl config .
       ./atctl on TWS all
   
   
   After this the query job issue will not occur
   
   Autotrace affects the shared memory of the local
   system and WAS suggests the following kernel parameter settings
   for eWAS 6.1 (the one embeded into TWS 8.4/8.5) on Solaris 10:
   
   projmod -s -K 'project.max-shm-memory=(privileged,4gb,deny)'
   user.root
   
   projmod -s -K 'project.max-shm-ids=(privileged,1024,deny)'
   user.root
   
   projmod -s -K 'project.max-sem-ids=(privileged,1024,deny)'
   user.root
   
   projmod -s -K 'project.max-sem-nsems=(privileged,512,deny)'
   user.root
   
   projmod -s -K 'project.max-sem-ops=(privileged,512,deny)'
   user.root
   
   projmod -s -K
   'project.max-file-descriptor=(privileged,1024,deny)' \
         user.root
   
   
   projmod is the command that modify at run-time the tunable
   settings.
   
   These new settings can be found in /etc/project
   
   Restart TWS/eWAS to apply new kernel settings.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See apar description.
   Problem occurs only when customer rerun a job as into
   apar description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This apar will be fixed into
   8.5.0-TIV-TWS-FP0001 and it is platform indipendent.
