PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting Data documents to aid in problem determination and to save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting Troubleshooting Data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBMÂ® Support quickly determine if:

Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery).
There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved.
There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity.
Locating root cause can speed development of a code fix.

Gathering General Information 
For supported levels of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager you can use IBM Support Assistant (ISA) to capture general information. Alternatively, you can also manually collect the general information. 

Entering general information into an electronically-opened PMR (ESR) [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html] eliminates waiting on the phone to provide general information to Level 1 support. 


Manually Gathering Reporting and Monitoring Information 
For UNIX/Linux platforms, gather the following files: 


Log type Log name Unix Location Install Anywhere log.txt /var/tivoli/tsm Deployment Engine acu_de.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine de_cbe.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine DE_Install.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine de_msg.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine de_trace*.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine si_trace.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine si_msg.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Deployment Engine si_cbe.log /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/root Composite Offering Installer install folder * /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan Composite Offering Installer inventory folder * /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan DB2 tmp folder * /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan DB2 logs folder * /opt/tivoli/tsm/_uninst/plan Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center logs folder * /opt/tivoli/tsm/AC/ISCW61 
*Please note that most installs create a logs.zip file with the contents of the _uninst directory. If this exists, it should also be submitted. The file is normally available in the following location:
/var/tivoli/tsm/logs.zip 


For Windows platforms, gather the following files: 


Log type Log name Windows Location Install Anywhere log.txt (Chosen install directory) Deployment Engine acu_de.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_cbe.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine DE_Install.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_msg.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine de_trace*.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_trace.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_msg.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Deployment Engine si_cbe.log C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\logs\Administrator Composite Offering Installer install folder * (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan Composite Offering Installer inventory folder * (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan DB2 tmp folder * (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan DB2 logs folder * (Chosen install directory)\\_uninst\plan Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center logs folder (Chosen install directory)\AC\ISCW61 
*Note: there may be a logs.zip file created in (Chosen install directory)\logs.zip which contains the contents of the _uninst directory. If this exists, it should also be submitted. 


Submitting Information to IBM Support 
After a PMR is open, you can submit diagnostic troubleshooting data [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21257908] to IBM. 

If using ESR [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html], update the PMR to indicate that data has been sent. 

Online Self-Help Resources
