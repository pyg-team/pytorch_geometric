Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: FPLibrary (Not found in java.library.path)


CAUSE
Changes made to the setCenteraLibPath.sh or setCenteraLibPath were not picked up by the WAS startup script. The WAS Content Engine instance was restarted from within the WAS console and not from the command line. In this Instance the setCenteraLibPath.sh file was added to the setupcmdLine.sh file but was not recognized . This caused the CenteraSDK path to not be loaded. 


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Websphere



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Following error is received when "Test Connection" is clicked: 

File = .\FnFCSMGR.cpp, Line = 359, Rev.= $Revision: 1.20 $ 

 

The [initialize]operation on the fixed content provider [com.filenet.engine.content.fcprovider.centera.CenterFCP(0)]failed. FPLibrary (Not found in java.library.path).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After making any changes to the setCenteraLibPath.sh or setCenteraLibPath.bat file restart WebSphere from the IBM console or the changes will not be detected.
