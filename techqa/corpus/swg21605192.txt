"ACUIR00003E The query failed with return code, 2." 

SYMPTOM

ACUIR00003E The query failed with return code, 2. 


CAUSE
Some directories and files, such as the tmp/ and db.lck files had a different owner than the admin that installed the product.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the ownership of the directories and file in: 

/home/ncosys/.acsi_ncosys/repos/IURegistryDB]# ls -ltr 

-rwxrwxrwx 1 ncosys ncoadmin 897 Jun 9 2011 service.properties* drwxrwxrwx 2 ncosys ncoadmin 4096 Jun 9 2011 seg0/ 
drwxrwxrwx 2 ncosys ncoadmin 256 Jan 20 00:15 log/ 
drwx------ 2 jtobin staff 256 May 4 00:15 tmp/ 
-rw------- 1 jtobin staff 4 May 4 00:15 dbex.lck 
-rw------- 1 jtobin staff 38 May 4 00:15 db.lck 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the above example, have the system administrator change the group and owner of the files back to ncosys and ncoadmin.
