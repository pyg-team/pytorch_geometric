The Test Data Management solutions for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne support JD Edwards EnterpriseOne version 8.10 out-of-the-box. Support for other EnterpriseOne versions may be available through a Professional Services agreement with IBM.

Version 9.1 of the Test Data Management solutions for JD Edwards are tested and distributed with the Optim Test Data Management Solution v9.1. Detailed hardware and software requirements are at: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036209 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024294].
