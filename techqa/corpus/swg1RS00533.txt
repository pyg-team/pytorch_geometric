ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The XOM file generated based on dynamic xsds is found to be
   incorrect upon published to RTS. This causes unexpected
   execution output result where the element name become unknown.
   For example, the XOM file in the resource folder of an ruleset
   archive, the element_Marktpartneridentifikation was declared
   twice under class IlogRulesXmlPackage.
   class IlogRulesXmlPackage
        property "ilog.rules.xml.packageInfo" {
            "1" {
                xmlName
   "{http://eon.com/emtg/smt/partnermgmt/bo/v1}element_Marktpartner
   identifikation",
                xomType
   "com.eon.emtg.smt.partnermgmt.bo.v1.Marktpartneridentifikation"
            },
            "2" {
                xmlName
   "{http://eon.com/emtg/smt/partnermgmt/bo/v1}element_Marktpartner
   identifikation",
                xomType
   "com.eon.emtg.smt.partnermgmt.bo.v1.Marktpartneridentifikation"
            },
   
   The correct should be 1) element_marktpartner and 2)
   element_Marktpartneridentifikation
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Trigger a change in rule project's property (e.g. add and remove
   a category), immediately synchronize and publish the changes to
   RTS without restarting RS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  correct XOM file is now generated by dynamic XSDS
