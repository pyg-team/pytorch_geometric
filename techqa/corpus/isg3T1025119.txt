VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-0718 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0718]
DESCRIPTION: Expat is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking when processing malformed XML data. By using the Expat library, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the victim or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113408 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113408] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2834 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2834]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-5285 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5285]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in PK11_SignWithSymKey / ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime when handling invalid Diffie-Hellman keys. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash a TLS/SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-8635 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8635]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a small subgroup confinement attack in Diffie Hellman Client key exchange handling. By confining the client DH key to small subgroup of the desired group, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover private keys.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVEID: CVE-2016-7545 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7545]
DESCRIPTION: Policycoreutils could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by a TIOCSTI ioctl attack in the provided sandbox tool. By persuading a victim to run a specially-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
