ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to create a Box collaboration folder on an IBM Case
   Manager case, the creation of the folder may fail with error
   code: 400 if the name of the solution contains spaces.
   
   This is inconsistent across solutions, as certain solution names
   with spaces will not have any issues with the creation of a Box
   collaboration folder.
   
   Here are the solution names that were tested and different
   results were observed
   
   Fail - 'Sample Box Event Handler Solution'
   Working - 'Sample Box EventHandlerSolution'
   Fail - 'AAAAAA BBB CCCCC DDDDDDD EEEEEEEE'
   Fail - 'Ffffff Ggg Hhhhh Iiiiiii Jjjjjjjj'
   
   When the creation fails, Box would return a 400 error:
