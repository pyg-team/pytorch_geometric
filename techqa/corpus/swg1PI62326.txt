APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. Create a test suite
   2. Start 2 command line adapters
   3. Create a command line adapter script
   4. Add multiple (example 8) test cases to the tests suite
   5. Associate all the test cases for the test suite to the same
   command line adapter script
   6. Run the test suite in parallel (check "Run this suite in
   parallel")
   7. In the "run test suite" dialog box, use the "Machine" column
   to divide the test cases between the 2 command line adapters
   
   Expected:  All test cases in the test suite complete, the "close
   and show results" button in the test suite execution console is
   active and the test suite execution result shows the last result
   Actual: All test cases complete but the  "close and show
   results" button is never active and the last result for the test
   suite execution record shows "in progress"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not run the test suite in parallel
