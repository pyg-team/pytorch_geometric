APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Windows platforms, running silent uninstall cannot uninstall
   desired components. The expected result is that the component
   requested to be removed is removed and other components remain
   intact and continue to report into the requested TEMS. The
   observed results are either the silent uninstall loops in
   itmpatchman.exe or the uninstall runs to completion but nothing
   is removed.  This error appeared in ITM 6.2.1 IF2, but may occur
   in any ITM 6.2.1 release until the fix is released.  The error
   does not occur during GUI uninstall.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
     To recreate:
     1. Install NTAgent using silent install.
     2. Try to remove the NT agent using silent uninstall. Until
        the fix is inplace the agent remains.  Other observed
        behavior is a loop in itmpatchman.exe.
   
   
   
   Related Files and Output:
     If itmpatchman.exe loops, the patch.log from
     <itmhome>\InstallITM directory is required to determine why
     itmpatchman.exe looped or hung.  Other files include the
     installation log from the same directory.  Better to send all
     *.log files zipped than not incoude one that is needed.  The
     patch.log and installation logs can be zipped and placed under
     the PMR directory so L3 can find them.
