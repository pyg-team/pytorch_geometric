PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Explanation on how to add a missing text search field index to an Oracle Maximo 7.x database 

SYMPTOM
Getting error messages stating indexes are not indexed or stating you are missing an index


CAUSE
Missing a text index

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You may get a BMXAA4210E - Database error number 20000 has occurred, ORA-20000: Oracle Text error: DRG-10599: column is not indexed error at some stage if you try to do something in Maximo. 

Say for example you try to search or do a query from the jobplan list screen.
It could be, after investigation, you find out that the text string index on the 
job plan table was missing or the whole index.

In order to identify if you have a missing Oracle index , please see Technote 1403468


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to ADD this missing text index back again, you need to run the following create index statement: 


CREATE INDEX jobplandes_tidx on jobplan (description) indextype is ctxsys.context parameters ('lexer global_lexer language column 
LANGCODE')

To use the above example,the same format counts for any text index you may need to re-add.
You just change jobplandes_tidx to index name, jobplan to table name, description to column name.
