APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM:
   While creating task in change application it allows to commit.
   It also allows further modification in that task in change
   application.  But if we go in the same record on activity and
   tasks application, it does not allow to commit after any
   modification. At this moment I am getting:
   .
   BMXAA4214E   an unknown error.  And in log I am getting
   java.lang.NullPointerException
   .
   This is because DBConfig allows an invalid relationship to be
   entered.
   .
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:
   No
   .
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   1) Create an invalid relationship.  In DBConfig app, open the
   WOACTIVITY object and create a new relationship with these
   values:
   Relationship Name:   PARENT
   Child:  TICKET
   Where Clause:
   ticketid = :origrecordid and class =:origrecordclass
   Then save it.
   2)  Go to Work Order Tracking Application and create a WO,
   and save it.
   3)  Click on Plan Tab and scroll down and create a TASK for
   Work Order,  Click Save icon.
   4) Scroll down further to Work Reference Information, and
   Go to Activities and Tasks
   5)  Make some change , eg in this example I added 455 in
   the description field.
   6)  Click Save button and get this error:
   BMXAA4214E   an unknown error while doing commit in activity
   and tasks application for task record.
   .
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   DBConfig app allows the invalid relationship to be entered.
   .
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   DBConfig should throw an error when when the relationship is
   being created/entered.  That is, the our customer was allowed
   to created a relationship which for an object which has
   inheritance relationship, and that new relationship should not
   be allowed to have a different child value.  It  could have a
   different where clause.
   .
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   In the above example the base object's relationship that it was
   conflicting with was:
   Object:  WORKORDER
   Relationship Name:   PARENT
   Child:  WORKORDER
   Where Clause:
   wonum=:parent and siteid=:siteid
   .
   ENVIRONMENT (SYSTEM INFO):

   * In DBConfig, while working with views, we should not allow a *
