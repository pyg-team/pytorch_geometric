ABSTRACT
 A new version of the Netcool/OMNIbus Gateway for BMC Remedy will be available to download from November 30, 2012. 

CONTENT
 

The gateway has been repackaged to coincide with the release of Netcool/OMNIbus V7.4. The new package is functionally identical to the old package; it is only the licensing that has changed. Additional information may be found in the announcement letter US reference 212-459 dated 27th November 2012.

You can download this package from the IBM Passport Advantage website:

The part numbers for both the old package and the new package are given in the table below. The part number that you download depends on which version of Netcool/OMNIbus that you have installed, because that determines which eAssembly you can access when you visit the IBM Passport Advantage website. The previous package is still currently available on the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Gateway Tier 2 eAssembly. The new package is available on the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Data Exchange Tier eAssembly.

To obtain the appropriate gateway package, search for the part number that corresponds to your Operating System and to the eAssemby that you have access to.
