APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the DataPower WebGUI, with the file management feature, you
   may view the details of a certificate file by clicking the
   "Details" link in Action column.
   
   However, if the certificate contains non-ASCII characters
   (such as: `  or  ~ ), DataPower may fail to display the
   details of the certificate and throw the following error:
   
   "Unable to obtain certificate details for file
   <directory-name>:///<certificate-file-name>, it may be
   password-protected, or it may not contain a certificate."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a certificate contains non-ascii character in the
   subject DN or issuer DN, the certificate detail can not be
   viewed from WebGui due to that character is not being properly
   encoded as a valid UTF8 XML character.
   
   Fix will be available in next major releases.
