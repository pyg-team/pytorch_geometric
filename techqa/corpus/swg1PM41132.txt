APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running multithreaded maps an error is produced resulting
   in map failures. The error can be seen in the input trace and
   will be similar to:
   
   External Parser returned Error:
   TYPE X'0003' (Error (-9), "XMLParser: Could not find type to
   assign XML data."
   No type to assign data was found
   
   Error (-9), "XMLParser: Could n).
   
   External Parser returned Error
   
   This behavior was observed running maps with the WTX Primitive
   and also the WTX Launcher.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00037766
   PVB / PVB
   Circumvention: Single thread the map execution.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers using XML parser in
   multithreading environment
   
   Problem Description:
   In valid error message "Error (-9), "XMLParser: Could not find
   type to assign XML data " thrown intermittently when running
   multi-threaded or running cashed map sequentially.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   ALL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Reordered code so that when searching for type matches, checks
   lower levels for match before checking for a schema element ID
   match. Schema element ID is a unique value for an element set
   during the first run of a particular map.
