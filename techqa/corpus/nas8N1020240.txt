 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL that were reported on August 6th, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3512 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3512]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an internal buffer overrun. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using invalid SRP parameters sent from a malicious server or client to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95158 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95158] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3509 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3509]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition in the ssl_parse_serverhello_tlsext() code. If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed session, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95159 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95159] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3506 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3506]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing DTLS handshake messages. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume an overly large amount of memory.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95160 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95160] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3507 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3507]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending specially-crafted DTLS packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to leak memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95161 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95161] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3511 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3511]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the negotiation of TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions by the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code when handling a badly fragmented ClientHello message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95162 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95162] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3505 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3505]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when handling DTLS packets. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95163 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95163] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3510 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3510]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malicious handshake to cause the client to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95164 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95164] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3508 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3508]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in OBJ_obj2txt. If applications echo pretty printing output, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read information from the stack.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95165 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95165] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-5139 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5139]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when an SRP ciphersuite is specified without being properly negotiated with the client. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the client to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95166 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95166] for more information
