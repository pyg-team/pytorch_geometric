Q1a. Is Notes supported on Windows 10? 
Notes 9.0.1 Fix Pack 4 introduces full support for desktop versions of both Windows 10 Pro (32-bit & 64-bit) and Windows 10 Enterprise (32-bit & 64-bit); this includes Notes, iNotes, Domino Designer, and Domino Administrator clients.  * 

Q1b. Does Notes support for Windows 10 (or any supported OS) include mobile devices? 
In addition to traditional desktop and laptop hardware, IBM Notes is supported on devices that are 2-in-1 PCs, convertible-hybrid laptops or detachable-hybrid tablets only if (1) the device is in "Laptop mode" with a physical keyboard and touchpad or mouse attached, and (2) the device is running a supported operating system. Notes is not supported on any devices running Windows Mobile or Windows Mobile Enterprise operating systems. 

Q1c. Is Notes supported on Windows 10 semi-annual channel releases? 
Yes. Notes supports Windows 10 semi-annual channel releases on versions and editions specified in Q1a. 


Q2. Are Notes Browser Plug-in and IBM Client Application Access supported on Windows 10? 
Yes. Notes Browser Plug- in 9.0.1 Fix Pack 5 introduces support for Windows 10. I BM Client Application Access 1.0.0.1 introduces support for Windows 10. 


Q3. Is Domino supported on Windows 10? 
No. Windows 10 is a client operating system and is not supported for Domino servers. 


Q4. Is the Microsoft Edge browser supported? 
Yes. If Microsoft Edge is set as the default browser, then Notes will open Web URLs in Edge. (Note: This specific functionality also currently works in both Notes Browser Plug-in and IBM Client Application Access, but not yet in iNotes.)
