Damien Sinardet is a Senior Software Engineer, working in the ECM EMEA Level 2 support team. He supports a wide variety of products within the ECM platform including FileNet P8 Content Manager, Business Process Manager and Case Manager. He started at IBM / FileNet in 1999. 

Presentation An IBM FileNet P8 WorkFlow, either within Business Process Manager or Case Manager, can be as simple as a few sequential tasks but can also be far more complex. The effective administration of such Workflow based systems requires knowledge of its concepts, how such concepts are implemented and what tools can be used to maintain it. This presentation discusses the fundamental concepts of what is a WorkFlow, and what does a WorkFlow consist of, as well as some recommended administrative practices. The purpose of this presentation is to assist system administrators in understanding, monitoring and troubleshooting WorkFlow systems.
