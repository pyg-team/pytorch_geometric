QUESTION
 Determine Why a Volume Remains in PENDING RELEASE Status by Checking Relevant Fields in the DFSMSrmm Volume Record. 

ANSWER
 

 When a volume is PENDING RELEASE and fails to return to SCRATCH status after the next run of Housekeeping: 

 1) Check the Actions Pending field for any actions marked Y. DFSMSrmm cannot return the volume to scratch status until all other release actions have been confirmed. 

 2) Check the Store Information Intransit field. If Intransit is Y, the volume is moving from one location to another. The volume must return to its home location before DFSMSrmm can return the volume to scratch status. 

 3) Use the RMM CHANGEVOLUME CONFIRMMOVE subcommand when the pending volume move has been completed. 

 4) Run DFSMSrmm inventory management to complete the volume's move to its home location. 

If Intransit is N, the destination field is blank and the volume is in its home location, then the volume should return to scratch during the next EDGHSKP EXPROC processing. 

If Intransit is N, and the volume that is in an automated tape library dataserver must return to a home location outside the automated tape library dataserver, then eject the volume and confirm the movement to the volume's home location. 

If the volume is system-managed, DFSMSrmm will not change the status of the volume from master to scratch if the update to the TCDB fails. The system running inventory management processing must have access to the TCDB. Check for error messages in the DFSMSrmm MESSAGE file.
