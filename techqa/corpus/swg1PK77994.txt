ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  error joblog timestamp calculation when the system
   has 1 leap second and DSNTTIM is at UQ77891 level
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No error , if SYSPLEX Timer specifies Zero or more than 1 second
   of Leap Second.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 for z/OS V8 and DB2 9 for z/OS users *
   *                 of the SYSPLEX Timer with a Leap Second      *
   *                 specification.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If the SYSPLEX Timer uses a Leap Second *
   *                      adjustment of 1 (second), DB2 does not  *
   *                      adjust the DB2 system time correctly.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If the SYSPLEX Timer has a one second adjustment specification
   for Leap Second, DB2 does not process LEAP SECONDS properly
   which can result in DB2 providing an incorrect system time.
   This can lead to DB2 using an incorrect TIMESTAMP value for DB2
   utilities, logging functions, etc.
   
   A leap second is a plus or minus one-second adjustment to the
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time scale that keeps it close
   to mean solar time.
   
   If Leap Second is set to one second, DB2 should adjust the GMT
   time (to get absolute time) by subtracting the number of leap
   seconds.  However, DB2 fails to adjust the time if Leap Second
   is set to one second.
   
   If the SYSPLEX Timer specifies zero or more than one second
   for Leap Second, this error does not occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This apar is being closed FIN.  The problem has been reviewed.
   If the SYSPLEX Timer specifies ZERO or MORE THAN ONE SECOND for
   Leap Second, the problem does not occur.  Because the likelihood
   of it occurring is small and the impact is minimal, the code
   modification to adjust the time correctly is being deferred to a
   future release.
