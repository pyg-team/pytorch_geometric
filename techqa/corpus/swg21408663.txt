 * Perform a complete uninstall of IBM InfoSphere Content Collector 2.1.0.2. and follow these steps as necessary. 1. Remove any services named 'ICC' that remain using the command: sc delete <servicename>

   5. After completing the installation you will be prompted with a dialog box asking if you want to start the Initial Configuration Wizard. If you plan to use your original and existing datastore say NO to this dialog.
