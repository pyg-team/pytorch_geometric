INSTCONFFAILED profileRegistry.xml_LOCK FileLockerException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to create a profile for WebSphere Enterprise Service, you might encounter a " INSTCONFFAILED: The profile could not be created." error. 

SYMPTOM
The following text shows the complete error: 

Profile creation is failing with this error: 

INSTCONFFAILED: The profile could not be created. For more information, consult the <path>\ESB\logs\manageprofiles\ESBAppSrv01_create.log file. 


When you examine the <path>\ESB\logs\manageprofiles\ESBAppSrv01_create.log file, it says: 

<message>com.ibm.wsspi.profile.WSProfileException: Another profile_nameprocess is running or a lock file exists. 

where profile_name represents the specific profile in question.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. If a process is not running, delete the profileRegistry.xml_LOCK file as specified in the com.ibm.wsspi.profile.WSProfileException message.
    
    
 2. If the complete path to the lock file does not exist, create it. The path to the lock file is stated in the message. For example, the message might say:
    If no process is running, delete the following file: 
    F:\IBM\WebSphere\content\config\ESB\properties\profileRegistry.xml_LOCK
    
    
    Ensure that the full path to the properties directory exists so that the lock file can be written.
    
    
 3. Recreate the profile.
