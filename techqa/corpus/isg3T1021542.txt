 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I make sure Platform Symphony is immuned to POODLE attack due to the SSLv3 vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566)? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
By default, SSLv3 is not enabled in Symphony so that POODLE attack is not a concern at all as it is based on a SSLv3 vulnerability. 

If SSLv3 is up, to avoid the potential attack, you may either choose to disable it or it is strongly recommended to change the cipher from CIPHER=EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA to RC4-MD5 or RC4-SHA to do the trick as this vulnerability is from CBC padding. Detailed steps are as follows. 


1. Open the ego.conf file on the management host using a text editor. The location of the file is defined in the EGO_CONFDIR environment variable.
2. Set EGO_DEFAULT_TS_PARAMS.

For example:
(Linux/UNIX)
EGO_DEFAULT_TS_PARAMS="SSL[CERTIFICATE=/etc/symcert.pem,CIPHER=RC4-MD5, PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/symkey.pem]"

(Windows)
EGO_DEFAULT_TS_PARAMS="SSL[CERTIFICATE=C:\xxc\newcert.pem,CIPHER=RC4-MD5, PRIVATE_KEY=C:\xxc\newkey.pem]"

5. Open the ego.conf file on the client host using a text editor.
6. Set EGO_CLIENT_TS_PARAMS.

For example:
(Linux/UNIX)
EGO_CLIENT_TS_PARAMS="SSL[CAFILE=/home/.../cacert.pem, CIPHER=RC4-MD5, SERVER_AUTH={myCN}"

(Windows)
EGO_CLIENT_TS_PARAMS="SSL[CIPHER=RC4-MD5, CAFILE=C:\xxc\demoCA\cacert.pem,SERVER_AUTH={myCN}]" 

If you choose to disable SSLv3 in Symphony, please refer to the Knowledge Center and remove all relevant parameters.
