   I reviewed the HW scan results file, it has CPU Frequency value
   detected.  See below under CpuFreq variable.

   Interesting that I have both ILMT v9.0 servers running in the my
   lab. One ILMT server has value in  CPU Frequency column for all
   virtual machines hosted by the same VMWARE host server.
   
   On other ILMT server has 0 value in CPU Frequency column for all
   virtual machines hosted by the same VMWARE host server.
   
   
   The only different that I could tell at this time.  When the
   System Model column is reported BLANK, the CPU Frequency column
   will report 0 value.
