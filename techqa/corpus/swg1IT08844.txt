APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user configured a sender channel to automatically start
   when a message was placed on the transmit queue. The transmit
   queue was set up for trigger type first and an initiation queue
   of SYSTEM.CHANNEL.INITQ. A process definition was defined with
   the process definition name and a user data value of the
   receiver channel name. Whenever a message was placed in the
   transmit queue, using the process definition, the receiver
   channel was initialized. As such the following error messages
   were written to the queue manager error log:
   .
   04/21/2015 06:24:41 AM - Process(22802.1) User(xxxx)
   Program(runmqchl)
   Host(xxxxxx) Installation(Installation1)VRMF(7.5.0.2)
   QMgr(xxxxxx)
   
   AMQ9502: Type of channel not suitable for action requested.
   .
   04/21/2015 06:24:41 AM - Process(22802.1) User(xxxx)
   Program(runmqchl)
   Host(xxxxxx) Installation(Installation1)VRMF(7.5.0.2)
   QMgr(xxxxxx)
   
   AMQ9999: Channel 'ReceiverChannelName' to host '????' ended
   abnormally.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make sure the process definition user data field contains an
   initiator channel name(e.g. sender channel).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using triggering for starting channels.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This problem occurred due to a trigger being defined for a
   receiver side channel(e.g. RCVR channel) on the sender side, and
   the queue manager did not validate the type of the channel
   before triggering.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ has been modified to validate the type of the channel before
   triggering and trigger only the specific channel types(e.g. SDR)
   which are allowed for triggering.
