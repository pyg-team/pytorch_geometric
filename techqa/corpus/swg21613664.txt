PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message EQA9957E - Invalid CICS release. Latest CICS used. You are running with Debug Tool and think that you have the required maintenance applied to support your release of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS). 

CAUSE
In this particular case, you are trying to use Debug Tool V11.1 with CICS TS V4.2. The most common cause for message "EQA9957E [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGTSD_10.1.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc_10.1/eqaarm02307.htm] - Invalid CICS release. Latest CICS used" in this case, is a missing toleration PTF UK66981 for APAR PM27734 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM27734]. 

CICS TS 4.2 is compatible with IBM Debug Tool 11.1 but you need to apply UK66981 to your Debug Tool product. If you are running with DebugTool 12.1, then PTF UK80658 for APAR PM66203 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM66203] is required to operate with CICS TS 4.2.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To verify what version of Debug Tool is in use, do the following: 

 1. Sign onto the CICS region and run the Debug Tool transaction DTSI [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021354]. This writes diagnostic information to a CICS temporary storage queue named EQAINFO.
    
 2. Enter CEMT INQ TSQ [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.systemprogramming.doc/transactions/cemt/dfha7mo.html](EQAINFO) to make sure the queue exists.
    
 3. Enter CEBR [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.systemprogramming.doc/transactions/cebr/dfha71u.html] EQAINFO to display the information in the temporary storage queue. You will see something like:
    
    CEBR TSQ EQAINFO SYSID CITW REC 1 OF 30
    ENTER COMMAND ===>
    ************************** TOP OF QUEUE ***********
    00001 Version Information:
    00002 DTSI Version............V8R1 PK58192 (In Progress)
    00003 Region Information:
    00004 CICS Applid.............A51C1CTW
    


The information above indicates that in this CICS region, you are using Debug Tool V8.1, not V11.1. Debug Tool for z/OS 8.1 is no longer supported (End of Service April 2011). The EQA9957E message occurs because the level of Debug Tool (or maintenance level of Debug Tool) does not support the release of CICS. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure you are using the correct version of Debug Tool for your CICS, and that you have the required maintenance applied. You can do this by finding "Debug Tool" in the "Supported Software" section of the Detailed System Requirements (Software Product Compatibility reports) for CICS Transaction Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006382]. Make sure that you look at all "Notes" and "Details" for Debug Tool. It is likely that this is where you will find any required PTFs.
