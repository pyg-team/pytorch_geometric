APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 FP1 installed with network
   license. The Sentinel License Manager version 8.5.0.0021 is
   installed on a Windows server and all your Clients get a license
   token from the server when the client computer are located at
   company site using IPv4 addresses upon connection to License
   Server.
   Howver, for your users who are offsite you use Microsoft Direct
   Access to connect to applications your company is using. For
   this connections IPv6 addresses are used. However, when your
   clients who work offsite using Microsoft Direct Access would
   like to work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 using a network license
   it does not work.
   When on IPV6 addresses they get the below error when they launch
   SPSS Statistics 22:
   
   Error # 2070
   The application is unable to communicate properly with the
   license server.
   The license server may be down, or there may be other
   network-related communication or DNS issues interfering.
   This command is not executed.
   Execution of this command stops.
   Specific symptom number: 5
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. Although Sentinel
   Licensing mechanism (which is a third party product) allows IPV6
   addresses  for their product this is currently not working
   together with IBM SPSS Statistics licensing. As a workaround
   please enable an amount of your license tokens for commuter, so
   your users who are offline can check out a commuter license for
   the work with IBM SPSS Statistics independent of network
   connections and IP addresses.
   Please see chapter 'Configuring commuter licenses' on Concurrent
   License Administratorâ€™s Guide.pdf on information how to enable
   commuter licenses on Licensing server.
