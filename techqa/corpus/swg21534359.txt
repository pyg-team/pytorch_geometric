 1. Try to reset the document and reprocess the data:  1. Click on View > Processing 
     2. Highlight all documents 
     3. Click RESET button 
     4. Try sending data again. 
    
    
 2. Verify that routine cleanup has been done on temp and audit log files, and that the document count maintained in Gentran:Director's browser drawers meets the required system limits.
