ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using a JAVA program to access Domino mail files via
   IMAP
   protocol. Sometimes IMAP enabled databases will become
   in-accessible.
   Error message from the JAVA program is
   "javax.mail.FolderNotFoundException: Inbox not found". Customer
   need to
   disable and re-enable IMAP for this database to workaround the
   problem.
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   Domino 8.5.3FP2
   Mail template: Standard 8.5.3 mail template in Chinese
   language
   
   TROUBLESHOOTING:
   
   The exception in customer's java program is:
   javax.mail.FolderNotFoundException: Inbox not found

   Customer does not allow to use any IMAP client in their
   environment so we are
   not sure if the problem is limited to their program.
   
   As workaround, customer can use "load convert -e-" and "load
   convert -e" to
   re-enable IMAP support.
   
   
   There are some error messages in console log, like:
   
   Note NT0009A942 was not updated in the IMAP btree for folder
   ($Inbox)
   (NT000003DA) in database /xxx.nsf. Database
   should be re-enabled for IMAP support.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  disable and re-enable IMAP for database
