CAUSE
 

One known cause is that the repository link for 7.1, 7.1.0.1 or 7.1.0.2 is pointing to \disk1\InstallerImage_win32\ (which is the Installation Manager repository location that is shipped inside the CC repository) and not to \disk1\ (which is the root ClearCase repository).

This may also occur if you are trying to apply an update to one product when you have multiple products installed. For example, when updating ClearQuest with a testfix where ClearCase is also installed which may also need to have the ClearCase testfix available as well.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Modify the repository location to point at the \disk1 directory. It is also possible to add an additional repository pointing to this location (making one repository for Installation Manager and one for ClearCase).
