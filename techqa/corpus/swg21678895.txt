Title: IBM CSPA200E began after an update to the Secure+ PARMFILE - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Secure+ PARMFILE was updated and connections using Secure+ began to fail:

CSPA202E Handshake failure, Certificate is expired or is not valid yet 

Upon restart of the DTF Secure+ did not initialize:

SITA190I Secure+ Initialization failed, Secure No Override No 


SYMPTOM
CSPA603I Secure+ SSL Environment Refresh Initiated.
CSPA604I Secure+ SSL Environment Refresh Successful.
CSPA400I Secure Parmfile Update by &userid MSG = CSPN000I 

CSPA200E Secure+ protocol mismatch. 

 or 

 CSPA202E Handshake failure, Certificate is expired or is not valid yet 



CAUSE
During the PARMFILE update the LOCAL.NODE entry was inadvertently updated to not allow overrides and a SAVE ACTIVE was done. When SAVE ACTIVE is done, the Secure+ environment is updated immediately. This effectively turned Secure+ off for the node



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do the following to reinstate Secure+: 

1. Take down the DTF
2. Correct the Secure+ PARMFILE to allow overrides. This can be done by either 

 a. Restoring the PARMFILE from a back up 

or 

 b. Sign on to the IUI for the node affected (this will be an ESF signon), change the override to Y (yes), and then do a SAVE AS to update the PARMFILE.
3. Restart the DTF.
