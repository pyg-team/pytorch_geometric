Title: IBM Logon IBM Content Platform Engine Administrative Client encounter FNRCA0032 error after WebSphere upgrade - United States

Text:
FNRCA0032 WAS V 8.5.5.11 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When applying Fixpack 6 for Content Platform Engine(CE) V 5.2.1 and also upgrade WebSphere to 8.5.5.11, customer encounter following error when logon CE Administrative Client (ACCE) . 

SYMPTOM
Here is detail error message shown on ACCE logon page:


 FNRCA0032 The JNDI cannot be accessed. Message was: Some object reference in the name "FileNet/Engine" relative to the context 
"<WebSphere_CELL_NAME>/nodes/<WebSphere_Node_NAME>/servers/<WebSphere_APPLICATION_SERVER_NAME>" is invalid. Some possible causes include a context binding in the name which refers to a destroyed context, or an object binding which contains an invalid EJBHome reference. 


CAUSE
JDK 1.8 is found incompatible with all available CE's version including 
CE V 5.2.1.6, following link states the limitation: 
http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=4E9614F0644011E39EBAF3C8D5105327&duComponentIds=Server_4E9A5AB0644011E39EBAF3C8D5105327 [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=4E9614F0644011E39EBAF3C8D5105327&duComponentIds=Server_4E9A5AB0644011E39EBAF3C8D5105327]
WebSphere 8.5.5.9 adds support for Java 8. However, issues can occur when deploying Content Platform Engine on this configuration. To work around the issues, downgrade to Java 6 or 7 to complete the installation. 

Moreover, for WAS 8.5.5.11, it only supports JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.8( by default) 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/ae/tins_installation_jdk7_gui.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/ae/tins_installation_jdk7_gui.html]
For the above link, you will find the following:
Starting in version 8.5.5.11, you must install either Java SE 6 or Java SE 8 as the version of Java SE contained in the /java and /java64 
directories in WebSphere Application Server and used by default during server and node configuration. Java 8 is the recommended Java SDK 
because it provides the latest features and security updates. You can continue to use Java SE 6, but no service can be provided after the end 
of support in April 2018, which could expose your environment to security risks.


ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere 8.5.5.11 ( be default JDK 1.8 applied)
Content Platform Engine(CE) V 5.2.1.6
Operating System including : Windows and AIX 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
As cause shows, due to the limitation, CE's EJB classes are deployed incomplete.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Content Platform Engine(CE) V 5.2.1.7 will fully support JDK 1.8, so before you can apply CE V5.2.1.7, you need to downgrade JDK 1.8 to JDK 1.7 or JDK 1.6 for the case.

Here are two options for how to switch back to JDK 1.6 for WebSphere(WAS) V 8.5.5.11 on Windows platform.

1)Downgrade WAS back to WAS 8.5.5.10 so JDK 1.7 or JDK 1.6 is supported.
2)Switch to JDK 1.6 for WAS 8.5.5.11 
a) stop WAS application server 
b) running managesdk command, here is an example: 

C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin>managesdk.bat -listAvailable 

CWSDK1003I: Available SDKs : 
CWSDK1005I: SDK name: 1.6_64 
CWSDK1005I: SDK name: 1.8_64 
CWSDK1001I: Successfully performed the requested managesdk task. 

c) if you find SDK name: 1.6_64 entry, which means you have JDK 1.6 
which can switch to, otherwise, please skip option 2) 
d) For Windows, run WAS_HOME/bin/managesdk.bat -enableProfile 
-profileName profilename -sdkname 1.6_64. 
For an example: 

C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\managesdk.bat -enableProfile 
-profileName AppSrv01 -sdkname 1.6_64 

e) restart WAS and rerun the deployment task. 
-profileName AppSrv01 -sdkname 1.6_64 

f) restart WAS and rerun the deployment task.
