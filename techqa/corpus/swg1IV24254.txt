APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TRC 5.1.2
   
   After upgrading to IF0011, the target searches don't not working
   properly.
   Here is the customer description of the issue:
   " The first search after targets results in the expected list of
   servers,
   but the next one show the exact same results
   even though the keywords have changed. Clicking "Show SQL" shows
   the
   previous selection and not the current one.
   For example, I tried to search for targets with the keyword
   "tsj" and
   got 5 servers. I then searched for targets with the keyword
   "was" and
   got the same 5 servers (which do not contain the string "was").
   This happens on 3 different stations we've tried to conduct the
   searches
   from, and we've performed a fallback to IF08. We still have
   IF0011 on
   our test server, which shows the same behavior. The TRC sessions
   by the
   way, work fine "
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is a simple workaround, which is to refresh the search
   results
   before doing a new search. Displaying a different report would
   also
   work, but it's a bit more cumbersome.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   Controller:       N/A
   Server:            ALL
   Target:            N/A
   
   
   Problem Description -
   
   
   When conducting a search, the results returned can be the
   results of a previous search. The user has to click on refresh
   to force new results to show.
   This issue is not confined to target searches but will also be
   seen when carrying out other search types, for example, users,
   user groups, target groups.
   
   
   Problem Summary -
   
   TRC server has a feature that will cache reports for a period to
   improve performance when requesting a report.
    The user is able to select refresh to force the server to
   regenerate the report on demand. A fix for
    IV17399 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV17399] - CPU consumption in Linux, prevented the same report
   being added multiple times to the queue
    awaiting for refresh. Now the server checks if a query with the
   same
    name is submitted twice, and if so it doesn't process it but
   just returns the cached results. However in the case of
    a search query, the name is static so all consecutive search
   requests look like the same report request to the
    server and therefore it returns the previously cached search
   results. The fix now excludes search reports from the check,
    resulting in the search being executed correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will be included  in 5.1.2-TIV-TRC512-IF0012

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Click refresh to force the correct results to appear
