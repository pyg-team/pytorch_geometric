Javacore and heapdump files are produced when this issue occurs. The javacore shows it was generated due to OOM caused by heap exhaustion, although heap was not fully expanded, there were many consecutive very large allocation requests. After analyzing the heapdump logs you can see that the java.lang.string is suspected mostly as the memory leak. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Connections Quality engineering is aware of the issue and it has been addressed in APAR# LO83405, which is included in Connections 5.0 CR3.
