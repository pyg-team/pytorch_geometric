ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR created for PC TS000071068 (SC TS000072255)
   
   PROBLEM: In ICD Service Portal, if user just looks at the
   offering and leaves the page a SR is created even though we
   never clicked on the submit button. Customer said problem does
   not occur if they login as maxadmin.
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:NO
   SECURITY ISSUE: YES
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   Step 1 In  ICD Service portal UI (for Self service center)
   click on 'Request a Service'
   Step 2 Click on a offering for example  in this demo Ramal
   (which is under  Telefonia)
   Step 3 When the 'Ramal' offering  is on screen,  Don't do
   anything  (don't type anything) just watch it
   Step 4 Leave this page (offering) by clicking on the higher
   link (for example Telefonia above)
   Step 5 As expected you left the offering page and now  you are
   on the previous  screen
   Step 6 Now go look for newly created service request.   Notice
   a new SR is created (even thought we never submitted the
   'Ramal' offering). This is the problem in this case
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   In service portal, SR is created even though we never clicked
   on the submit button.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   In service portal, SR should only be created if user clicks on
   the submit button.
