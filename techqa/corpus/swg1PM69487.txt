   TEXT READS:
   WebDAV overview and entry point URL
   WebDAV is defined by RFC2518 as an HTTP extension framework with
   a plug point for the access and management of hierarchical data,
   for example, in content management systems. WebDAV stores the
   data in collections. It allows you work with the data in a user
   interface view that is similar to that of a file system. A
   folder represents a WebDAV collection. Various tools are
   available for integrating WebDAV resources into the client file
   system. Users can use these tool to view and modify
   resources that they can access via WebDAV. For more details
   about the WebDAV specification refer to the RFC2518 document at
   the Web link given at the end of the page. For more information
   about WebDAV in the portal refer to the topics about Using
   WebDAV with WebSphere&#65449; Portal.
