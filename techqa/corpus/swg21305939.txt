QUESTION
 This technote explains how it is possible to generate an unmanaged Web Service client that runs in a JRE version 1.4.2 and accesses a Web Service that runs on IBM Websphere Application Server version 6.1, given that IBM速 Websphere速 Application Server v6.1 runs in the IBM JRE 5. 

ANSWER
Rational Application Developer version v7.0.0.x supports both WebSphere Application Server versions 6.0 and 6.1. WebSphere Application Server 6.0 runs on the IBM JRE 1.4.2. Therefore it is possible to generate a JAX-RPC WebService client that targets WebSphere Application Server 6.0 to obtain an unmanaged Web Service client that runs in a JRE version 1.4.2 . 

Given a JAX-RPC WebService created by targeting WebSphere Application Server 6.1 (IBM JRE 1.5), you can generate a JAX-RPC WebService client from the wsdl file. If you want the client to be unmanaged and to run in a JRE with version 1.4.2, you can proceed as follows:

1. Create a new Java Project.

2. Set the JRE to be the WebSphere Application Server v6.0 JRE (which has version 1.4.2): 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Add Library > JRE System Library
 * 
 * 
 * Installed JREs
 * 
 * WebSphere v6 JRE


3. Set the compiler compliance level to 1.4:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Java Compiler
 * 
 * 
 * Enable project specific settings
 * 
 * 
 * Compiler compliance level: 1.4


4. Add the WebSphere Application Server 6.0 thin client jar file to the build path (using the Add External Libraries button in the Java Build Path > Libraries tab). By default, this jar file is located in:  * C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v6\runtimes\ibm-jaxrpc-client.jar
 * 
 * 
 * C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v6
 * 
 * 


5. Generate a Web Service client proxy from the existing wsdl.  * 
 * 
 * File > New > Other > Web Services > Web Service client
 * 
 * 
 *  Server: WebSphere v6.0 server 
   Web service runtime: IBM WebSphere JAX-RPC 
   Client project: above created Java project 
   

6. Implement the web service client by providing a main method that invokes the functionality of the generated proxy. 

Note: If you plan on using the Sun速 Microsystems JDK on Microsoft速 Windows, instead of the WebSphere v6.0 JRE, you will need to obtain a Xerces distribution and to add it to the Java Build path (you will need the files: xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar). See the Related information section for download locations.
