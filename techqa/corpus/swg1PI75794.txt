APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  URL-Alias is defined with a JNDI name at cell scope. Clusters
   was overwritten with the URL-Alias from the cell scope.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  add "-Dcom.ibm.ws.runtime.disableResourceReload=true" as a
   generic JVM
   argument on the server process
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server with resources of the same           *
   *                  JNDI name defined in multiple configuration *
   *                  scopes                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Partial server resource reloads cause   *
   *                      wide-scoped resources to override       *
   *                      narrow-scoped resources                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When changes are detected to resource configuration documents,
   the WAS resource manager reloads resources at the scope(s) at
   which it detects changes to the resources.  In cases where
   changes are detected in wide-scoped resources (such as a cell
   or cluster), the resource manager's reload process rebinds
   resources in these definitions to JNDI.  If there are
   resources with the same JNDI name defined at a more immediate
   scope (such as a node or server), this can override the
   existing JNDI name binding for those resources, causing
   unexpected resource definitions in those nodes or servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A configuration setting has been added to prevent the
   resource manager from performing a partial reload of the
   resource configuration.  To enable this setting, add
   "-Dcom.ibm.ws.runtime.disableResourceReload=true" as a generic
   JVM argument on the server process.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
