Text:
RaPM JDBC database WebSphere tip TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On RHEL6 the RAPM may not update the DB2 JDBC provider definition in WebSphere and caused a JDBC connection issues for RAPM 

SYMPTOM
RAPM WebSphere SystemOut.log show JDBC error


CAUSE
DB2 JDBC provider definition in WebSphere not set during RAPM install

ENVIRONMENT
RAPM on Linux

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere SystemOut.log shows JDBC errors

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The remedy is to manually set the JDBC details in the WebSphere admin console.




Steps: 

1. Open the WebSphere Application Server administrative console.

2. Click Resources > JDBC > JDBC providers > Security Modeling DB2 JDBC Driver . 
In general properties specify the "Class path" attribute value as:

< DATABASE_HOME_DIR_PATH>/java/db2jcc.jar
< DATABASE_HOME_DIR_PATH>/java/db2jcc_license_cu.jar
< DATABASE_HOME_DIR_PATH>/java/db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar

for example:- /opt/ibm/db2/V9.7/java/db2jcc.jar 

3. Save the changes and restart the Tivoli Integrated Portal server.

The RaPM installer uses the Websphere script library procedure (AdminJDBC script procedure) to manage the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) configurations. The AdminJDBC script procedure is located in the WAS_HOME/scriptLibraries/resources/JDBC/V70 directory. The installer code (related to the JDBC configurations) is not changed after the RaPM GA version. 


Some Default Log locations:
The default location of log files is as follows:
IBM Installation Manager log file :- /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs/ *.xml
