PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Install P8CE-4.0.1-013
   Set the MIME type on the Content Element according to the file
   extension for the content.
                 A
   P8 Document has a MIME type property on the Document object
   and on any Content Elements attached to the Document.
   The correct MIME type must be set on the Content Element; the
   Document MIME type setting does not matter.
   
   There are two possible MIME types for .dxl files and the
   correctone depends on the content file extension.
   
        File extension: .fngwentity
       MIME type: application/x-fngwentity
   
     File extension: .DXL
    MIME type: application/x-dxlfile
   
   If the customer using ICC then they do not need to set the MIME
   type for Documents added by ICC. ICC submits files with the
   correct file extension and sets the corresponding MIME type on
   the ContentElement.
