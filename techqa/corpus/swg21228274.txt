QUESTION
You want to monitor an agent in a Lotus Notes® database to see how long it takes to execute. What is the best way to do this?

ANSWER
The Agent Manager can be configured to output execution reports to the console when an agent runs on the Lotus Domino® server. To do this, you can either:
-- Enable the parameter, "debug_amgr=r", in the server's notes.ini file,
or
-- Enable the debug dynamically by issuing the command, "tell amgr debug r", at the server console

When an agent runs with this debug enabled, you will receive additional diagnostic data similar to the following:


 * <date time> AMgr: Agent 'Test Agent' in 'database.nsf' ran successfully; elapsed time was '111' ticks
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * .
