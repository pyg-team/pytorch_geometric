PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users running Enterprise PL/I programs       *
   *                 under Debug Tool, who receive message        *
   *                 "EQA1750E An error occurred during           *
   *                 expression evaluation" when trying to list   *
   *                 the value of a variable that is based on     *
   *                 an invalid pointer.                          *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When running Enterprise PL/I programs   *
   *                      with Debug Tool, a LIST command that    *
   *                      references a based variable with a bad  *
   *                      basing pointer receives message         *
   *                      EQA11750E. This message is not helpful  *
   *                      in determining why the expression       *
   *                      evaluation failed.                      *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The same message is issued for different types of errors that
   occur during expression evaluation. The message is not helpful
   to the user in determining why expression evaluation failed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The PL/I runtime library routines can provide a return code
   to Debug Tool that will indicate that an invalid basing pointer
   has been detected. This will allow Debug Tool to issue a more
   descriptive error message.
   
   If a basing pointer is found to be invalid, either because it
   contains x'00000000' or is pointing to inaccessible storage, a
   new return code will be returned to Debug Tool from Enterprise
   PL/I.
   
   Debug Tool will issue message  "EQA2296E Unable to display the
   variable based on an invalid pointer." when this new return
   code is received.
   
   Support for this new message requires applying co-requisite
   Debug Tool fixes for the appropriate Debug Tool version.
