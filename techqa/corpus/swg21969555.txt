Title: IBM Installation Fails to Complete When Using a Deployment Tool to Install IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to deploy IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office (NMO) fail while using a deployment tool such as Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Run the NMO install interactively [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco044.htm?lang=en]. 
 * If the installation works as expected, the problem is with the deployment tool being used. 
 * Note: Do not use the NMO .msi file to perform the installation as this is not supported. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Verify NMO pre-requisites [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=1379371439042&osPlatforms=AIX%7CLinux%7CMac%20OS%7CWindows&duComponentIds=D009&mandatoryCapIds=30%7C126%7C9%7C140%7C61%7C26&optionalCapIds=12%7C63%7C35] are met. 
 2. Run the NMO install interactively.  * If this works as expected, the issue is with the deployment tool. 
     * If there is an issue with manual execution of the installation exe, then open a problem management record (PMR) with IBM Support.
