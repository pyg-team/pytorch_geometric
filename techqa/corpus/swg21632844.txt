QUESTION
 What is the procedure to enable trace logging to troubleshoot DASH runtime issues/errors? 

CAUSE
You can use trace logging to assist in monitoring system performance and diagnosing problems. Since trace logs can be quite verbose and include many unrelated errors, resetting the logs and then reproducing the problem issue can reduce the time required for log analysis for specific issues.

ANSWER
Steps to enable tracing: 


Enable trace logging. 

 1. Log into the DASH. After logging in navigate to Console Settings [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21632844&amp;aid=1] > Websphere Administrative Console. 
 2. Navigate to Troubleshooting -> Logs & Trace 
 3. Click on the Server1 -> Select Diagnostic Trace Service. Increase the Maximum Number of Historical Files from 1 to 10. 
 4. Click Apply, then select Change Log Detail Levels. 
 5. Click on Runtime tab to enable tracing for the DASH process that is currently running. Enabling tracing from the Runtime tab will keep tracing active until the next time the DASH server process is stopped. To make tracing persistent even after stopping and restarting the DASH server process click the Configuration tab instead. 
 6. Clear the trace string in the Groups box and replace it with the following:
    
    *=info: com.ibm.isc.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.*=all: com.ibm.iscportal.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.service.datastore.consoleproperties.*=INFO
    
    For the Connection manager (data provider related issues) you will want to enable all for the following components:
    
    *=info: com.ibm.isclite.rest.*=all:com.ibm.tivoli.conmgr.*=all 
 7. Click on the Apply button. 
 8. If you enabled tracing from the Configuration tab in step 4, then click the "Save" link that appears at the top of the page. ("Save to master configuration")


Once tracing is enabled, reproduce the DASH runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. 

Run the log collector program:


 1. Change the directory to <JazzSM Home>/ui/bin 
 2. Run the following command:
    
    ./consoleLogCollector.sh or .bat
    
    Send us the console_logs.zip file located in <JazzSM Home>/ui directory


and attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR). Please include the time the issue was reproduced in the PMR update. Please also provide the DASH version info:
<JazzSM Home>/ui/bin/consolecli.sh Version

Upload the resulting output file to the PMR
