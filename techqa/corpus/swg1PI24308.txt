APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The SubscriberCompleting extension point has been added to WCM
   public Java API.
   
   Note: SubscriberComplete and SyndicatorComplete have been
   deprecated. The new SubscriberCompleting extension should be
   used instead.
   
   Details:
   The Subscriber Completing extension point allows implementors to
   receive notification of a subscriber run completing.
   
   The provider passes in a summary of changes to the extension
   point allowing implementors to determine what item level
   changes
   syndication performed during the run.
   
   Note that throughout a syndication run an item may be saved
   multiple times as part of the internal syndication process. Many
   of these multiple updates are collapsed and combined into single
   change info of the final consistent item. As a result the
   changes provided may not match the amount of events from other
   event sources such as the more generic WCM JMS topics.
   
   The extension keeps track of changes during the run in a
   non-persistent way and makes no guarantees of recovery from
   failure. If the system was to fail during a run the updates
   performed during that run may never be reported, please plan
   usage accordingly.
   
   Also note that the extension is called during syndication
   completing so as of invoking the syndication run is still
   considered active. As a result its not possible to run
   syndication within the implementor for the given
   syndicator/subscriber pair.
