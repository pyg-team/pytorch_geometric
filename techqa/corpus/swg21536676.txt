PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to erase batch using cmuerase - No batches match selection criteria 

SYMPTOM
Unable to erase batch using cmuerase 

A0x0304 - C0x1020: Erase command failed - No batches match selection criteria


CAUSE
After applying maintenance 2.4.01 or 2.4.02 with SR 1356697, some batches were being left in a state that they could not be erased. When multiple offline extracts ran simultaneously against the same batch, the in-use counter was not being cleared properly, which caused the next batch assigned to the counter 
element to appear to be in use by an extract operation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply maintenance containing a fix for SR1362442.
