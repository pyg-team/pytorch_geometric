Scenario ONE

I am using SPSS/Statistics and have successfully installed the SPSS Python Integration plugin. While I can call Python from within SPSS, I am having problems getting SPSS to load from Python. I'm getting an error message when running the program from IDLE. The message states, in part:

SpssError: [errLevel 1011] Cannot load SPSS XD API.

What is causing this problem?

Scenario TWO

I have installed SPSS Advantage for Excel 2007 on a Windows XP Pro machine but I get the following error message on opening Excel:

"Unable to load spssxd.dll. The specified procedure could not be found (exception from h-result 0x8007007F).

What is causing this problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem can be caused by having an incompatible version of a third-party module named zlib.dll that SPSS uses on your system. 

Do a search on your system for that dll and most likely you will find an older version in your \Windows\System32 directory as well as the one that SPSS installs in its own directory. The connection works from the SPSS side because it's loading zlib.dll from its own directory, but since the third-party module doesn't have its own copy, it's loading it from the \Windows\System32 directory.

As a workaround, you can either update the older version of zlib.dll found outside of SPSS's installation directory or add SPSS's installation path as the first in the list to a PATH environment variable under User Variables.

SPSS would like to apologise for any inconvenience
