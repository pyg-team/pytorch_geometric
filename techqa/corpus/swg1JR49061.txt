APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Internet Explorer browser with the Instances
   widget provided by IBM Business Monitor, it is not possible to
   select the contents of a data cell.  This business data cannot
   be copied to an external application since it cannot be
   selected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use an alternate browser, such as Firefox, to select and copy
   text from the Instances widget to an external application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  You cannot select text from the data cells of the Instances
   widget.
   
   EDITIONS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1.0
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   Some of the JavaScript application programming interface (API)
   calls that the Instances widget uses are not compatible with
   Internet Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for Business Monitor V8.0.1.0 that avoids
   making API calls that are incompatible with Internet Explorer.
