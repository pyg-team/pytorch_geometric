QUESTION
 Are there any configurable timeout values for SOMA connections to the ITCAM for SOA DataPower agent? 

ANSWER
The ITCAM for SOA DataPower agent code has two timeout values for SOMA connection. One is for connection timeout, one's value is hardcoded with 5000 milliseconds. If the timeout expires before the connection can be established, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. The other timeout is for a read timeout, this is defined in the config file bn.ini/bn_<instanceName>.config, the parameter is called "KBN_DP_READ_TIMEOUT". The default vaule is 60 seconds. If the timeout expires before there is data available for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised.
