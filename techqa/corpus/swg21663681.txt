Title: IBM Clients stuck in grace/restricted mode - United States

googlebigfix TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Steps to resolve clients that are stuck in grace or restricted mode 

SYMPTOM
Either one or both of the following Fixlets in the BES Support site have clients reporting as applicable: 
# 1 - "BES Clients in Seat Count Grace Mode Critical"
# 2 - "BES Clients Restricted by Seat Count Critical"


CAUSE
The client has a stale actionsite masthead on its endpoint.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
NOTE: This problem should no longer occur as of about 2011/2012 when at that time BigFix changed its licensing management model in a BigFix deployment from a per seat license to a perpetual license with content site entitlements. If this problem is happening in your deployment today, your deployment may have been around since before the year 2012 and you might be deploying clients using an old obsolete model license masthead. Check your client installers and ensure you are using a current masthead. Be aware that if you are deploying the client via the .msi installation binary, the masthead is baked into this binary package. If that is the case, you will need to throw away the .msi installer package and cease from using it. Any endpoints that re experiencing this problem should be re-installed using a current modeled license masthead exported from the database via the BESAdmin tool.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the client version on the endpoint is less than 9.0, a client reset action may work. Take action on Fixlet # 220 - "TROUBLESHOOTING: Reset the BES Client" in the BES Support site.

If a client reset cannot be performed, execute the following command (on the command line) on the server from within the C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server directory:
$> BESAdmin.exe /resetDatabaseEpoch

And then take a blank action to all endpoints as a master console operator.
