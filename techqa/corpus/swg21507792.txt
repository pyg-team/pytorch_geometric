QUESTION
 ITCAM for Application Diagnostics V7.1 (zLinux SLES10) installation using launchpad.sh or setup_MS_lin.bin command yields error messages:
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.Error: Probable fatal error:No fonts found.
at sun.font.FontManager.getDefaultPhysicalFont(FontManager.java:934)
at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:191)
at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:183)
at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:144)
The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag. 

CAUSE
This is caused due to missing font RPM packages or a broken symbolic link which is more commonly the real cause.

ANSWER
Check the RPM font packages. If you do have all the fonts installed, then check this symbolic link: 

 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 Aug 5 2010 fonts -> ../../../../../share/fonts/java 

this entry existed in the following directories 

/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1_5_0-ibm-1.5.0/jre/lib/ 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1_5_0-ibm-1.5.0/jre/lib/ 

To resolve the problem, delete the above fonts symbolic link from both the directories and then upgrade the following packages (using YaST or Software Updater):
> java-1_5_0-ibm 1.5.0_sr12.4 1.5.0_sr12.4 Java(TM) 5 Runtime
> java-1_5_0-ibm-32bit 1.5.0_sr12.4 1.5.0_sr12.4 Java(TM) 5 Runtime
> java-1_5_0-ibm-fonts 1.5.0_sr12.4 1.5.0_sr12.4 Java(TM) 2 Runtime
