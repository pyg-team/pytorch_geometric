APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A 'RESTORE VM' operation for VM guests with incorrect backup
   images might return the following errors :
   
   ANS0324E partialObjLength value for partial object retrieve is
            invalid.
   ANS4177E Full VM restore of VMware Virtual Machine 'vmname'
            failed with RC=34 target node name=
            '<target node name>',
            data mover node name='<agent node name>'
   
   The problem was found for VM guest backups performed with the
   testflag VMRESTORE_INCVMDKSIZE.
   
   The 'RESTORE VM' error will be seen with any available VMware
   transport mode (VMVSTORTRANSPORT SAN, HOTADD,NBD,NBDSSL)
   When one backup image using the Incremental Forever backup mode
   was generated using the above testflag, and even if following
   image backups are correctly done, the 'RESTORE VM' still might
   fail.
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager Client 6.4 and later on Windows and Linux
   
   Initial Impact: High

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Contact support to get the needed VM guest restored
   and
   2. Start new series of backups for that VM guest with a IFFULL
      VM backup to avoid future occurrences
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: * Backup-Archive client versions 6.3 on      *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply fixing level when available. This      *
   *                 problem is currently projected to be fixed   *
   *                 in levels 6.4.2 and 7.1.1. Note that until   *
   *                 the fixing levels are available, this        *
   *                 information is subject to change at          *
   *                 the discretion of IBM.                       *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The backup-archive client now verifies each disk before vm
   restore and if the testflag is set fixes the disk size.
   
   The error message is still issued to indicate there was
   an issue before the client fixed the disk size to restore it.
   In the future, we will consider whether a warning message
   instead of an error message would be a better design.
