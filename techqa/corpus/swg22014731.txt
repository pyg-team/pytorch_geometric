RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue only happens on Windows operating systems that do NOT have all important MS Windows updates installed. 

Make sure to install all Microsoft Windows operating system updates. 

You should also make sure to have .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later installed, as this is a requirement for AMOS.

Probably you have to run Windows Update and restart Windows multiple times in order to get Amos to work. Once, when Windows Update settings tab displays “No important updates available”, you may click “Check for updates” aagain and then you may get got more important updates thast needs to be installed.
