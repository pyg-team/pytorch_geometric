APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TDWC GUI allows a double-backslash to be entered into the
   LOGIN
   field in a Windows job definition. Once this is in the
   database, it
   causes errors for composer imports.
   
   Steps to recreate:
   1) Create a new Windows Job
   2) Under General tab - specify a "Login" that has a
   double-backslash in
   it. For example: MIKE\\USER
   3) Export jobs to a file:
      composer create jobs.txt from jobs=@#@
   4) Try to import these back in:
      composer replace jobs.txt
                   ^
   "jobs.txt", line 4: **ERROR**(202) AWSBIB202E There is a syntax
   error.
   An object identifier (for example,
   a job name) contains non valid characters.
    STREAMLOGON MIKE\\USER
                          ^
   "jobs.txt", line 4: **ERROR**(16) AWSBIB016E There is a syntax
   error in
   the job statement in the job stream definition. The
   "streamlogon" user
   name is not syntactically valid. The name must be no more than
   47
   bytes, and cannot contain periods or other special characters.
   AWSBIA090I For file "la.txt": errors 2, warnings 0.
   
   Here is the big problem... wherever this line occurs in the
   export
   file... composer aborts at that point, with the error above and
   does
   not load anything after this line. This causes big problems
   with using
   dataexport/dataimport as the schedules which reference any job
   after
   that error line will not create properly as the jobs are not
   loaded.
   
   TDWC GUI should be modified to not allow this as an input to
   the LOGIN
   text input box.
   
   Tested this on 8.5-9.2 and this is a problem on all versions of
   TDWC
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually remove the double back-slash before import
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  see apar description
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This apar will be fixed    8.1.0-TIV-TDWC-FP0002 and
   9.2.0-TIV-TDWC-FP0002
