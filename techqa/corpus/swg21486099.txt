Title: IBM Why am I receiving a message with 'Error Code 201' and ' License generation failed'? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running the License Authorization Wizard, I receive the following warning/error message:

Error from Generator:
Description: License generation failed.
Error Code: 201

Why am I receiving this message? What can I do to resolve the problem? 

CAUSE
Expired Authorization Code. 

Invalid Authorization Code.
Invalid Lock Code


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The 'Error 201' with 'License generation failed' message is typically caused by the following: 

 * Expired authorization code (activation key). 
 * Authorization code (activation key) is for a different product version.


If you have installed a new version of an IBM SPSS product but are using a previously possessed code, the authorization code is likely not correct for the newly-installed product. Please contact your organization's IBM SPSS product coordinator to acquire a new authorization code correct for the new product version. If you installed a previously-installed version of an IBM SPSS product and using a previously possessed authorization code, the code is most likely expired. Please contact your organization's IBM SPSS product coordinator to acquire a new, unexpired authorization code.
