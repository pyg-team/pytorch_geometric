ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For any process app, if the BPD is not exposed to start create
   a new snapshot,
   Use it to create a deployment package onto a offline server,
   Choose "leave" option.
   Then, deploy the package to offline server,
   On ProcessAdmin -> Installed App, click the
   "migrate in-flight data" of the new installed snapshot
   
   Problem:
   no previous snapshot will be shown even if we have a running
   instance of a previous snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   For any process app, if the BPD is not exposed to start,
   create a new snapshot, and use it to create a deployment
   package onto a offline server, choose "leave" option. Then,
   deploy the package to offline server, on ProcessAdmin ->
   Installed App, click the "migrate in-flight data" of the new
   installed snapshot, but no previous snapshot will be shown
   even if we have running instance of previous snapshot.
   Reproduction steps :
   1) for any process app, if the BPD is not exposed to start,
   create a new snapshot, and use it to create a deployment
   package onto a offline server, choose "leave" this time.
   2) deploy the package to offline server
   3) on ProcessAdmin -> Installed App, click the "migrate
   in-flight data" of the new installed snapshot, but no previous
   snapshot will be shown even if we have running instance of
   previous snapshot.
   The changes that were made to fix this issue allow
   inflight migration of data for non-exposed BPD instances for a
   given snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The changes that were made to fix this issue allow
   inflight migration of data for non-exposed BPD instances for a
   given snapshot.
