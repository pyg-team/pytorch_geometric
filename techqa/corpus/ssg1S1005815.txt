Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Badlock Samba vulnerability issue on IBM SONAS (CVE-2016-2118) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Badlock is a loophole that affects Windows and Samba systems/client. Badlock for Samba is referenced by CVE-2016-2118 (SAMR and LSA man in the middle attacks possible) and for Windows by CVE-2016-0128 / MS16-047 (Windows SAM and LSAD Downgrade Vulnerability). When Samba is configured as Domain Controller it allows remote attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's endpoints, and obtain sensitive session information, by running a crafted application and leveraging the ability to sniff network traffic 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
