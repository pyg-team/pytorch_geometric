 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I want to change IBM SPSS Statistics Client from using a Network License to a Site License. 
Is there a way to do this without the need to reinstall IBM SPSS Statistics Client? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Yes, by editing certain files and settings within your workstation.

First, go to your SPSS Statistics install directory and open the file "spssprod.inf" using a text editor.
Delete the entry in the field "DaemonHost" which contained details of the server housing the Sentinel RMS License Manager and replace it with 'no-net'.
E.g.
Previous setting: 'DaemonHost=127.0.0.1' or 'DaemonHost=ServerName'
New setting: 'DaemonHost=no-net'

Next, delete the "LSHOST" or "LSFORCEHOST" environment variable if present. You can check this on a Windows machine, by Right-Clicking 'My Computer' and selecting 'Properties'. Navigate to the 'Advanced' tab and open the 'Environment Variables' button.
Check under User Variables or System Variables for the LSHOST or LSFORCEHOST environment variables, if found, delete them.

Finally, run the License Authorization Wizard to relicense your SPSS Statistics product with your new Site License. This file (named "law.exe") can be found in IBM SPSS Statistics installation directory
