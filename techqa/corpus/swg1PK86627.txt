APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For the request table, the datatrim process splits the entire
   rows in
   terms of timestamps. Now, it was found that more than the commit
   count
   set rows can be related to the same timestamp being deleted,
   thereby
   resulting in DB resource errors.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Suggested hotfix is to delete in steps of commit count.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM Managing Server users who have very
   * large request data collection in their database and/or do not
   * run the datatrim job for a few days leading to accumulation
   * of large amount of data in the Octigate database.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * Database resource errors when the datatrim is run when there
   * is a large accumulation of request data in the Octigate
   * database due to datatrim not run for a long time (e.g. one
   * week).
