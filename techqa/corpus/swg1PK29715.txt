ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SITA is getting error
   Error 200046 deleted. Message appears "Selected item is
   currently marked as unavailable"
   
   when they try deleting a Template folder.
   Please see the attached screenshot for information.
   Neither Mario nor me are able to reproduce this error.
   The only reference to such an error message I've found is
   Federica's PMR (also for SITA) 00603,SGC,848
   Also, there is a technote about this error message.
   Unfortunately the situation where this error occurs is
   completely different.
   Here is what Mario wrote:
   The PMO was creating folders in the template area to populate it
   with
   template documents. I was also showing them how to do this.
   Nothing
   particular happened to the two folders that were created and
   then could not
   be deleted. We did not have problems with other folders to be
   deleted. I
   had tried a test to see if it would reproduce and I was not able
   to.
   There is no context menu and the folders are and always were
   empty.
   How can we proceed as I am pretty clueless.
   Thanks,
   Dejan
