ABSTRACT
 Download the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1 Fix Pack 2 firmware upgrade. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This firmware release includes improved capability for WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1 Fix Pack 2, also known as V2.1.0.2.


Caution: After you upgrade either 9235-92X or 7199-92X appliance types with Version 2.1.0.2 firmware, you cannot roll back to any firmware version prior to Version 2.1. You must operate at the Version 2.1 or higher firmware level. Subsequently, when moving from Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 levels to Version 2.1 levels, you cannot roll back to previous firmware versions.

When upgrading from Version 2.1.0.x 
To upgrade the collective while servicing workloads, you must complete the firmware upgrade process on one appliance before starting the process on another appliance within the collective. After upgrading one appliance, monitor the replication completion in the monitoring console before proceeding to upgrade the next appliance. Do not make any configuration changes until all of the appliances are on the same firmware level. See Updating the firmware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wdpxc/v2r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/aa/aat_updating_firmware.html] in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Information Center, for more information.

When upgrading from Version 2.0.0.x
When you are upgrading to Version 2.1.0.2 from a version prior to Version 2.1, you cannot run a firmware upgrade on a collective that is currently servicing a workload. When you upgrade a collective, all of the data that was loaded into the data grids is lost. The XC10 collective configuration is preserved during the upgrade process. When you are running firmware upgrades on the appliances in a collective, the appliance that you upgrade does not fully restart until all of the appliances in the collective are upgraded to the 2.1 firmware.

When upgrading from Version 1.0.0.x
You cannot upgrade from this level to the most recent level. You must first upgrade to Version 2.0, and then upgrade to Version 2.1.0.2.
