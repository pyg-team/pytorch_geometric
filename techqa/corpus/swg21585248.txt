Title: IBM Improve the responsiveness of Rule Team Server while browsing artifacts - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If Rule Team Server v7.1.x or later seems to respond more slowly while browsing rule artifacts compared to earlier versions such as v7.0.x or v6.7.x, what could be a reason for it ? How can the performance be improved ? 

CAUSE
New features added to the explorer view of RTS 7.1.x can lead to more round trips to the database to retrieve data. In many setups the difference is not noticeable, but it may be experienced with a larger number of rules and/or higher latency in the network link between the server and the database.

ANSWER
For any given Rule Project the responsiveness of the explorer view may be improved by disabling the following options in "Project > Manage Project > Edit Project Options": 

 * Show number of elements in the Rule Explorer 
 * Refresh children on expand in the Rule Explorer
