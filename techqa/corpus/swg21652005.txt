Title: IBM Argument names of methods and constructors imported into the BOM - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Argument names for Java XOM methods and constructors imported into a Business Object Model (BOM) are lost and set to the generic arg1, arg2, arg3... 

This is a problem for constructors used to build Decision Validation Services (DVS) Excel scenario files, which contain the input data and expected results used for testing sets of rules. 

The warning below is shown when generating the DVS Excel scenario file, as the generic names would be used for the column headers of the input and expected values, making it difficult for users to know how to set these values:

"GBRTV0006W: the arguments of the constructor have generic names (arg1, arg2, etc.). Rename the arguments by reusing the names of the corresponding attributes or with your own meaningful names." 

CAUSE
The BOM creation from Java classes is based on Java introspection. The argument names are not part of the bytecode, so the BOM import function cannot retrieve the argument from the Java compiled classes.

ANSWER
To automatically get the argument names you want, you can use Java annotations. 

The product provides the ilog.rules.bom.annotations.BusinessName that can be used per argument, as in the following example:



 * public MyMethodOrConstructor(@BusinessName("name") String name, @BusinessName("money") int money) {...


See documentation at Operational Decision Manager V8.5 > Decision Server Rules > Developing rule projects in Rule Designer > Designing business object models > Designing a BOM for a Java model > Adding annotations to the XOM > @BusinessName [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.designer.dev/designing_bom_topics/ref_bom_businessname.html]. 


Alternatively, you also can use a standard Java annotation for constructors, java.beans.ConstructorProperties: 

 * @ConstructorProperties({"name"})
 * 
 * public MyClass(String name) {...
