APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR IZ35858 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ35858] reports a memory leak in RSCT 2.4.9.4 / 2.5.1.4
   under AIX within library cu_ifs_getaddrs().
   This library is also used by the IBM.GblResRMd sub system of
   System Automation 3.1 Fixpack 1, resulting in the memory usage
   of the IBM.GblResRM is increasing slowly, but steady.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a.
   As a circumvention, the memory usage of the IBM.GblResRM process
   might be monitored, and the process may be killed using 'kill -9
   <PID-of-GblResRM>', after a given limit is reached.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  As described in APAR IZ35858 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ35858], there is a memory leak starting in
   RSCT 2.4.9.4 and 2.5.1.4 under AIX within library
   cu_if_getaddrs(). This library is also used by the IBM.GblResRM
   sub system of System Automation starting at level 3.1.0.1.
   This results in the IBM.GblResRM shipped with System Automation
   3.1 fixpack 1 is also leaking memory, if the above RSCT level is
   installed on an AIX system.
   The impact is, that the memory usage of the IBM.GblResRM sub
   system is increasing slowly, but steady, until the maximum
   allowed memory is used by the sub system. At this timecomands to
   list resources controlled by this sub system fail, e.g. lsrsrc
   IBM.Application hangs, and in the trace of the sub system it can
   be seen, that the request to allocate memory failed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  RSCT support has provided a fix for this problem, which
   will be shipped in the following RSCT levels/APARs:
   AIX 5.3: 2.4.10.1  (APAR IZ34065 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ34065])
   AIX 6.1: 2.5.2.1   (APAR IZ34064 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ34064])
   It is recommended to install the corresponding RSCT PTF as soon
   as it becomes available.
   
   The RSCT levels with the fix will be shipped with System
   Automation 3.1 fixpack 2.
