QUESTION
 Whenever I publish a TRIRIGA Business Object or do something that should cause TRIRIGA to send an outgoing email, no email is sent and an error like the following appears in my server.log: 

2015-10-14 10:18:03,167 WARN 
[com.tririga.platform.error.ErrorHandler](WFA:12020990 - 12564078 Associate:287434693 IE=287434676) Authentication failed; nested exception is javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException: failed to connect[MID-620604269] com.tririga.platform.error.PlatformRuntimeException:

I do not have EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME or EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD values set, as I am using Anonymous SMTP authentication. My mail server indicates that there was a "generic failure" and it was unable to "canonify user and get auxprops." 

Do I need to hardcode values in order to get past the above error? 

ANSWER
No, you do not need to hardcode EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME or EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD values in order to get past the above MailAuthenticationExceptions and make TRIRIGA send emails. 

Instead do the following: 

 * Stop your TRIRIGA server 
 * Comment out the EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME and EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD lines in your TRIRIGAWEB.properties file. After doing this, these lines should have a '#' in front of them and will look like this: 
   
   # EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME= 
   # EXTERNAL_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD= 
   
 * Restart your TRIRIGA server 
 * Try again to have TRIRIGA send an email. The authentication error should be resolved and the email should be sent. 


This solution apples regardless of whether the application server being used is WebSphere, WebSphere Liberty profile, or WebLogic. RELATED INFORMATION
