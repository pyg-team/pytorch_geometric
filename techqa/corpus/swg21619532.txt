css; Inso filter; FNRCE0000I TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CSS indexing is failing. Getting the following error message in the Content Engine (CE) P8_server_trace.log:

CBR FNRCE0000I - INFO Unable to initialize INSO filter because it is not configured correctly. This is only a problem if the IBM Text search component will be used 

SYMPTOM
 

 * Index jobs displaying as in progress but it's not indexing. 
 * Turn on CE P8 Trace for CBR subsystem and the below message is logged:

CAUSE
The CSS Client did not install properly to update the Content Engine server (CE) therefore the INSO filter is not updated.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 The Content Engine ping page doesn't reflect the correct INSO version. Connect to this URL to verify the INSO version:
