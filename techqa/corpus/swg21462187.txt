Text:
64bit; hang TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Notes fails to launch if attempted to install on Windows 7, 64 bit to the path: 

"C:\Program Files\..."


During the install, if the user chooses the install location to be C:\Program Files\... , then Notes will appear to install correctly. However, when trying to launch, the user may see the splash screen and an error: 

"Cannot complete the operation. Notes is running but not
responding. Please close and restart Notes."

CAUSE
Since Notes is a 32 bit application, due to Windows restrictions it cannot be installed to
C:\Program Files\..... 

And will automatically be directed to C:\Program Files (x86)\



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If attempted to install to just "Program Files", the executable files will install under:
C:\Program Files (x86)\.... 


A Notes Data folder will appear in 2 places with the core data files under: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Lotus\Notes\Data 

and the Workspace folder under: 

C:\Program Files\Lotus\Notes\Data\workspace



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this, Notes must be reinstalled. Use either the default path, "Program Files (x86)", or install to another path outside of "Program Files" such as C:\Lotus\Notes.
