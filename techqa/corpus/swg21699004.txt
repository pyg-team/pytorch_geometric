Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with RSA Export Keys may affect IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability (CVE-2015-0138) may affect IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager web service interface and IBM Tivoli Directory Server shipped as a component of IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138] 
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange cipher suite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers.

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691]
for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
