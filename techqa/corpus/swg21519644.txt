QUESTION
 Do I need run db_optimization_tool to rebuild index if I use Oracle 10 g? 

ANSWER


No, you donâ€™t have to run db_optimization_tool from GIS to rebuild index if you use Oracle 10 g database for GIS. Oracle 10g has a job created automatically to collect the statistics on the schema objects. If that job is enabled and running, it will also rebuild indexes similar to the db_optimization_tool option from GIS.
