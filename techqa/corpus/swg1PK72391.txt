APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Multiple languages omit the %p symbol which prints the AM and PM
   strings for the time format.
   
   For example in en_US we have in the drop down in Admin > Users:
    (short) 01/01/03 08:30PM
     (medium) Jan 1 03 08:30:00PM
     (long) January 1 2003 08:30:00PM GMT
     (full) Wednesday January 1 2003 08:30:00PM GMT
   
   in ja_JP:
   
     (short) 03/01/01 08:30
     (medium) 2003/01/01 08:30:00
     (long) 2003<year in JP> 1<month in JP> 1<day in JP> 08:30:00
   GMT
     (full) 2003<year in JP> 1<month in JP> 1<day in JP> <Wednesday
   in JP> 08<hour in JP> 30<min in JP> 00<>sec in JP> GMT
   
     All of the languages should have the AM\PM symbol in the time
   format or the long and full format are incomplete.
   
     Corrective action #1:
   
     1) Open the file $BF_HOME/ui/includes/config.php
     2) The $TIME_FORMATS array holds the information for the Admin
   > Users drop down
     3) Modify the language entry to include the %p in the proper
   place:
     For example:
     'ja_JP' => array(
     'date' => array(
      'short' => '%y/%m/%d',
      'medium' => '%Y/%m/%d',
      'long' => '%Y %B %e',
      'full' => '%Y %B %e %A',
     ),
     'time' => array(
      'short' => '%I:%M',
      'medium' => '%I:%M:%S',
      'long' => '%I:%M:%S%p %Z',
      'full' => '%I %M %S%p %Z',
     ),
     'datetime' => '{date} {time}'
    ),
   
   Corrective action #2:
   You can also issue an SQL query to update the desired user's
   date\time format.
   Short - '%y/%m/%d %I:%M'
   Medium - '%Y/%m/%d %I:%M:%S'
   Long - '%Y %B %e %I:%M:%S%p %Z'
   Full - '%Y %B %e %A %I %M %S%p %Z'
   
   Issue the query and fill in the blanks with the desired format:
   UPDATE bf_users SET bf_datefmt='<FMT>' WHERE bf_login='<USER
   LOGIN>;
   COMMIT;
   
   For example to set the root login to short format:
   UPDATE bf_users SET bf_datefmt='%y/%m/%d %I:%' WHERE
   bf_login='root';
   COMMIT;

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The time format in Japanese did not use the 24 hour clock
   nor did it use AM/PM to signify the morning or afternoon
   hour.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added AM/PM to the beginning of the time string, so if you
   were reading the time in english it would show up as:
   
   ....AM 11:49:00...
