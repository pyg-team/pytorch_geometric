Title: IBM Cannot save documents assigned to an entry template in IBM Content Navigator (ICN) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In an environment containing ICN plus IBM FileNet P8 Content Process Engine 5.2.1 (CPE), saving a document associated to an entry template results in the document losing its association to that entry template.


SYMPTOM
The following error appears in Websphere System logs:

Caused by: com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException:
FNRCD0009E: DB_ERROR: The database access failed with the following error: ErrorCode 0, Message 'DSRA1300E: Feature is not implemented: PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream' 



CAUSE
The system is configured with the incorrect Oracle JDBC connection to the backend CPE.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade the Oracle JDBC connection from ojdbc5.jar to ojdbc6.jar.
