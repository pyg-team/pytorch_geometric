QUESTION
 SSL mutual authentication is not performed on FTP or HTTP Server adapter after replacing the existing certificate with a new certificate. When configuring a FTP or HTTP Server adapter to use a new CA certificate, a client could connect to the server without providing the CA certificate which is not a expected behaviour . 

CAUSE
This depends on the following property configuration in perimeter.properties: SslSessionDatabaseTimeoutSeconds

ANSWER
This is an expected behavior and it depends on the following property in perimeter.properties: SslSessionDatabaseTimeoutSeconds=3600 

SslSessionDatabaseTimeoutSeconds indicates how long a cached SSL session is valid. The valid range is 30 seconds to 24 hours (60*60*24 = 86400 seconds). 

So even though a CA certificate has been changed, SSL session will have the previously mentioned CA certificate info for the specified SslSessionDatabaseTimeoutSeconds time. Within this time frame all connections will be allowed.

It is recommended to use SslSessionDatabaseTimeoutSeconds to a lower value to avoid these kind of scenarios or restart Sterling Integrator and Perimeter Servers. The minimum value is 30 seconds.
