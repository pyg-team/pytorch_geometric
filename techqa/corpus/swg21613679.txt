QUESTION
 I migrated to a newer version/fix pack of the product. After I log into the application using Internet Explorer browser, I get a "Could not load" error (full error in following section). Why am I getting this error and how can I fix it? 

CAUSE
The migration process of IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server includes deploying the ccd.war file. This file contains the source code and determines what code will be executed when a user performs certain action. The ccd.war of the older version of the product will become unreachable and can lead to issues if Internet Explorer cache still contains reference to previous ccd.war file. The end user may get errors similar to the following after logging in:

ANSWER
Go to "Tools" > "Internet Options" > "General" tab, navigate to "Browsing History" section and click "Delete." In the resultant screen, click delete again to clear the cache. 

Important Note: When clearing the Internet Explorer cache, make sure that the browser does not retain any data. For example, if "Preserve Favorites website data" option is checked in Internet Explorer version 8, then JavaScript and CSS files may be preserved in the browser cache leading to unreachable file references from previous product level (before applying a patch). So please make sure this is not checked before clearing the cache.
