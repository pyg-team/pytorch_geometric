ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: Simultaneous Person transfer requests cause a CTGIM556E
   error and
   sometimes the submittal verification is referring to the wrong
   person.
   
   Description: They have two users doing person transfers (pull up
   a list
   of Persons and select a person and click transfer to move them
   from the
   root level of the organization to an OU).  One of the users is
   rwhal and
   his ITIM account has administrator privileges.  The other
   account is
   esupport2 and it has help desk privileges.
   
   When they are doing transfers, rwhal will select the user "Bob"
   and set
   it up to transfer him to a ou.  While he is doing this,
   esupport2 is
   selecting the user "Jane" and setting the person up to be
   transfer.
   They hit the submit button and rwhal will get the following
   error -
   CTGIMU556E An error has occurred. If the problem persists,
   contact your
   system administrator.  esupport2 will get the confirmation
   screen for
   the person "Bob" (they were doing "Jane").  It's submitted and
   "Bob" is
   transferred, while "Jane" is not moved.
   
   When rwhal goes to View All Requests, he see that "Bob" was
   transferred
   and rwhal is listed as the requestor, even though esupport2 was
   the one
   that actually ended up hitting the submit button.
   
   The both users are using different machines and access the App
   Server
   via port 9080.
   
   Desired Behavior: Client needs to be able to have multiple team
   members
   submitted person transfer requests at the same time and for them
   to work
   as expected.
