QUESTION
 How do you change the management port IP address on a IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance M/T 9235, 7199, or 7198? 

ANSWER
 

What you will need to complete this task: 

 *  A personal computer (PC) with either a:  * For a M/T 9235:  * serial port connection 
       * docking station with a serial port connection, 
       * USB to serial port connection adapter
      
      
    * For a M/T 7199 or 7198  * Use the USB serial console cable (USB to RJ45) and a DE-9 serial console cable (RJ45 to DB9) supplied with the appliance. 
      
      
   
   An emulator program such as Hyperterminal or Putty The password for the "admin" user id New management port configuration information:  * New IP address 
    * Port number 
    * Default gateway IP address 
    * Full IP subnet mask 
   
   

Task steps:  1. Connect the PC the to the appliance serial port and configure the emulator program.  1. Connect the PC:  * For the M/T 9235: Use the null-modem cable or a USB-to-serial converter cable or docking station to connect the PC with the terminal emulator program to the SERIAL connector on the appliance. 
         * For the M/T 7199 or M/T 7198: Use the USB serial console cable (USB to RJ45) and a DE-9 serial console cable (RJ45 to DB9) supplied with the appliance. 
           
           The USB serial console cable will connect to USB port on your PC and then to the serial connection on the DE-9 serial console cable. The DE-9 serial console cable's 8-position modular plug at one end connects to the appliance. You may use your own USB-Serial converter cable if one is not available. 
           
           The drivers for the USB serial console cable provided with the appliance are on the IBM® WebSphere® DataPower SOA Appliances: Resource Kit CD in an archive file.
           
           The driver for Windows systems is in the driver/win/ directory. 
           The drivers for Mac OS systems are in the driver/mac/ directory.
           For driver installation instructions, see the readme file or Installation Guide in the archive file. 
           
           You can download the resource kit cd from Fix Central. Use this Fix download method for WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21376557] technote. On the Identify fixes pages, click on the "Text" radio button and enter "resource kit" in the field below the radio button 
           
           Notes:  * Do not use an Ethernet cable to plug the serial console port into an Ethernet network. 
            * Do not use a telephone cable to plug the serial console port into a Telephone network (digital or analog). 
           
           
        
        
     2. Configure the emulator program.  * Confirm the COM porting being used by the USB device driver. 
           For example: To confirm the COM port for your USB to serial converter in Microsoft Windows OS. Open the "Device Manager" and expand the "Ports" section the converter should be listed with the assigned COM port. 
         * The emulator program will need to be configured for standard 9600 8N1 and no flow control operation. 8N1 is a notation for a serial configuration in asynchronous mode, where there are eight (8) data bits, no (N) parity bit, and one (1) stop bit. 
        
        
    
    
 2. Power on and logon with the 'admin' user id:  1. If the appliance is not turned on, toggle the power switch to the ON position. The power switch is on the rear of the appliance. You should see the green power LED light illuminate on front of the appliance and hear the fans start up. - You should hear the fans change speed as the screen displays the following information. DPOS... Wait for a few seconds for the appliance to boot. If the appliance has the HSM module then booting can take 10 minutes. 
     2. At the login prompt, enter admin 
     3. Enter the 'admin' user id's password at the password prompt. 
    
    
 3. Change the management port's IP address:  1.  Access Global configuration mode by entering the following command: 
         configure terminal or config 
     2.  Access the configuration mode for the MGMT Ethernet interface by entering the following command: int mgt0 
     3.  Configure the IP address and subnet mask for the Ethernet interface by entering either of the following commands:
         IP and "/" subnet mask: IP address 10.10.10.2/32 
         IP and full subnet mask: IP address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.255
         
         Note:  * Always set the IP address before the default gateway. 
          * The IP address and subnet mask above are examples only. Verify the correct ones to use with you network team.
         
         
     4.  Configure the IP address of the default gateway for the Ethernet interface by entering the following command: IP default-gateway <gateway> 
     5.  Exit the configuration mode for the Ethernet interface by entering the following command: exit 
     6.  Define the specialized HTTP server to support WebGUI access by entering the following command: web-mgmt <IP to listen on> <port> 
         Example: web-mgmt 10.10.10.2 9090 
     7.  Enable SSH by entering the following command: ssh 10.10.10.2 
     8.  Save the changes to the configuration by entering the following command: write memory 
     9.  You are prompted to confirm that you want to overwrite the existing configuration. Enter y. 
     10. Save your configuration by entering the following command: write memory 
     11. Exit Global configuration mode by entering the following command: exit 
     12. Exit the command line session by entering the following command: exit 
    
    
 4. Checking the changes:  1. At the command prompt enter:  * show int 
         * show int mode 
         * show web-mgmt 
         * show ssh 
        
        
     2. Compare the output of these commands with the changes you have made 
     3. If you need to make any changes, you can issue the commands in step "3. Change the management port's IP address:" again.
