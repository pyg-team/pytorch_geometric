 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your WebSphere MQ (WMQ) batch job abends with an abend 102 - 00000000
ABEND102 ABENDS102 S102 

CAUSE
One reason for Abend 102-00000000 - 

Mismatch in code levels between WMQ MSTR (Queue Manager) and the batch job

The S102 is occurring as the batch job is running with V701 libraries (for example, SCSQAUTH dataset which contains CSQBSRV, CSQBCON etc) against a V710 queue manager. In order to run against a V710 queue manager the V710 libraries need to be used by the batch job. 
In order to connect to a V710 queue manager the application needs to run with a V710 SCSQAUTH. The V710 SCSQAUTH will allow an application to connect to both a V710 or a V701 queue manager. 
This is documented in the Information Center (section 'z/OS: Planning for migration from WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1 to WebSphere MQ version 7. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi77108_.htm]1';

Per ' Application migration and interoperation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi23001_.htm]' topic, WebSphere MQ does not support connecting server applications loading libraries from the earlier level to connect to a later level of queue manager. On z/OS the STEPLIB must reference the target libraries for the queue manager. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In IPCS you can view level of CSQBSRV in the batch job address space.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Correct the STEPLIB for the batch job to point to the V7.1.0 libraries.
