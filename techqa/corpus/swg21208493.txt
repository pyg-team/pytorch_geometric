QUESTION
 It may be difficult for a user to determine what level of TWSz is installed on a given system. This technote provides several techniques for finding this information. 

ANSWER
To determine which level of TWSz is in use on a given LPAR can be determined as follows: 

1. The TWSz release of the CONTROLLER is displayed on the TWSz entry panel EQQOPCAP for releases V8R5M0 and up. 


2. The TWSz Release is indicated by the subsystem definition for Controllers and Trackers in
SYS1.PARMLIB(IEFSSNxx). 

If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITD, the subsystem is for OPC V2R3.
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITE, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.1.
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITF, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.2.
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITG, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.3.
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITH, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.5.
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITI, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.5.1
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITJ, the subsystem is for TWSz 8.6
If the specified INITRTN is EQQINITK, the subsystem is for TWSz 9.1

(If the OPCOPTS BUILDSSX() option is used, it may override the subsystem definition. See
#3 below).

3. If the BUILDSSX() keyword is used in the CONTROLLER or TRACKER init parms, message EQQZ172I will be written to the started task EQQMLOG at startup time, showing the FMID of the TWSz subsystem code. However, IBM recommends this keyword be used ONLY as a migration aid, or to enable implementation of subsystem maintenance without requiring an IPL. (Please review technote 1265106 for information on correct usage of the BUILDSSX() keyword. 

4. Place the following INITIALIZATION STATEMENT in your CONTROLLER 
and TRACKER init parms:
>
> DIAGNOSE MAJORFLAGS(X'00100000')
>
This will cause the first 48 bytes of each CSECT of the EQQSSCMx subsystem control loadmodule to be written to the EQQMLOG, showing the compile date/time and maintenance level (if any) of each CSECT. The TWSz version and release can then be determined by looking up the PTF number, or if there is none, from the compile timestamp of the base-level code.
