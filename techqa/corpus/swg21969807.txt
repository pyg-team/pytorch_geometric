QUESTION
 Does IBM UrbanCode Deploy support the Oracle database character set AL32UTF8? 

ANSWER
All UrbanCode Deploy testing for Oracle 11g uses the AL32UTF8 encoding. 
UrbanCode Deploy testing for Oracle 12c uses the WE8MSWIN1252 encoding. 

This means the AL32UTF8 encoding under Oracle 11g is explicitly supported by IBM, but not under Oracle 12g.

Note: While support for AL32UTF8 encoding under Oracle 12c is not explicitly guaranteed, that does not mean it will not work.
