Title: IBM Delete option is grayed out for a DOORS module - United States

Text:
delete menu; grayed out; delete option; disabled; greyed out TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are unable to delete an IBM Rational DOORS module in a project because the Delete option is disabled. 

SYMPTOM
You have RMCDA access to a module in a project using Rational DOORS; however, when you select the module you can not delete it because the option is disabled.


CAUSE
Modules that are partitioned out, modifiable, can not be deleted. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This happens when the module has been partitioned out with modify privilege. 

Data that has been partitioned out must first be returned or recovered if no return partition is available.

Option #1: Rejoin the partition [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/doorshlp/v9/topic/com.ibm.doors.administering.doc/topics/t_rejoinpartition.html] 


Option #2: Recover a partition [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/doorshlp/v9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.doors.administering.doc/topics/t_recoverpartition.html]
