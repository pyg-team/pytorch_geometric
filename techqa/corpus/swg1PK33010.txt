Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WCM Syndication v6.0 when an object is moved from one library to
   another, the content is syndicated to the previous library
   instead of being syndicated to the library that it had been
   moved to.  The cause for this is below.
   
   
   The Eventlog for the moved Content is recorded in the library it
   was moved from causing the wrong syndication update.
   
   It should be recorded in the library the Content or item was
   moved to.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Moving items from one library to another does not get Syndicated
   and Delete of Published Content fails.
   If item is moved from one library to another Syndication Update
   is n't sent to Subscribers.
   Delete of Published Content fails after installing PK32712 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK32712].
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified Event log for move of item from one library to another.
   Changed Package Generator to generate update if either
   destination or both source & destination libraries are
   syndicated to Subscriber otherwise delete is sent to Subscriber.
   Package Processor will update the item if library of the item
   from Syndicator is different from the one on Subscriber.
   Removed the code which throwed null pointer Exception for delete
   of Published Content.
