APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In DB2 Administration Tool, using ALC to insert a column into a
   table can result in msgispt034 syntax condition raised in exec
   adb27a rc40 only if ENTER key is not used after the new column
   definition is completed.
   .
   If HOME key, or TAB key, or cursor movement through a mouse-like
   device is used to re-position the cursor to either the ALTER
   command in the list of valid line commands, or to the command
   line where ALTER is keyed in followed by ENTER, an error occurs
   after processing the ENTER in panel adb27c, and progressing
   through panel adb27a where another ENTER is processed.
   .
   Error report appears similar to:
   .
   *
   *   Function : ADB27A, LINE 1133: line.i='COL'||,
   *
   *   Retcode  : 40
   *
   *   Zerrmsg  : ISPT034
   *   Zerrsm   : Syntax condition raised
   *   Zerrlm   : Error executing EXEC - now terminating
   *
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After entering the new column definition, press the ENTER key
   before processing ALTER on either the valid line command list,
   or by typing ALTER on the command line.
