PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to view the contents of a CSV file exported from IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation, UTF-8 characters appear as garbled characters. 

SYMPTOM
Characters do not appear correctly, although when viewed in a text editor the characters look correct.


CAUSE
Excel does not recognize the file as UTF-8 encoded and the contents must be imported using the built-in Import wizard.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To import the contents of the file in to Excel 2010 and higher:


 1. Create a new spreadsheet 
 2. Click on Data -> From Text 
 3. Browse to the CSV file exported from DOORS Next Generation 
 4. Select "Delimited" for the data type 
 5. Select "65001: Unicode (UTF-8) as the file origin 
 6. Select "Comma" for the delimiter 
 7. Proceed through the wizard until the data is imported in to the spreadsheet 
 8. 


As an alternative, you can also set the file encoding to UTF-8 BOM using a text editor that supports it. This will set the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM) which will force Excel to recognize the file as UTF-8. In this case, the import wizard is invoked automatically upon opening the file.
