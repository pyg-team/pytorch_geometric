 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed spss 16.0 on Windows Vista and ty to export a table or chart to PowerPoint, or I try to open a new script Window.
I receive the following error "unexpected error: quitting"
What is the reason for this error ? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and has been fixed in SPSS 17.0.
We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. 

Please see the workaround described below for version 16.

There are several registry key entries that need to be established for any script based procedures to run correctly. These procedures include using the actuall Script interface (File->New->Script or File->Open->Script), exporting to Powerpoint, or running standalone scripts through the Utility menu. 
The current workaround for this problem is to have someone with sufficient system privledges run a script to get these registry entries created. System administrators are ideally suited to this and they should make sure to run SPSS as administrator by right-clicking the SPSS icon and then selecting "Run as Administrator..." option. Once SPSS is running just open a script window through File->New->Script. At this point all users on the affected computer should be able to run scripts or open up script windows.
