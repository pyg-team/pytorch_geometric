Title: IBM Generate Default Desktops fails with connection error with IBM Datacap Navigator - United States

Text:
generate desktops wtm connection web client TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When configuring the Datacap Navigator plugin in IBM Content Navigator, an error appears when Generate Default Desktops is selected, stating:

A connection to the web client cannot be established by using the following URL 

CAUSE
This error has a variety of possible causes. It could be the wTM service is not running, the Default Datacap wTM URI is incorrect, or if the Datacap desktops already exist, because the plugin has been disabled for those desktops.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To isolate the cause: 

 1. Using a browser on the Content navigator server, attempt to connect to the wTM service using the wTM URI and appending /help to the end.
    Example - http://MyServer:90/ServiceWTM.svc/help [http://MyServer:90/ServiceWTM.svc/help] 
 2. If the test fails, run the same test directly on the wTM server. 
 3. If a local connection cannot be made, the wTM service is not running, or is not configured for the URI being used. See Datacap Web Services installation steps [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSZRWV_9.1.1/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dcitws001.htm] for information on configuring Web Services. 
 4. If the local connection works, but the connection from wTM fails, then this is a network issue. Check firewall and network settings to allow the request. 
 5. If both browser tests work, but Generate Default Desktops fails, set the logging level to Debug in Content Navigator and retest. 
 6. Check the SystemOut log for the error and troubleshoot the error in the log. 
 7. If there is no error in the log and the desktops already exist, check the desktops to insure that the plugin is enabled for that desktop.  1. In the Desktops section, edit one of the Datacap desktops. 
     2. In the General tab, expand the Plug-ins section. 
     3. Assure that it is either set to Enable all deployed plug-ins, or that the Datacap Navigator plugin is enabled.
