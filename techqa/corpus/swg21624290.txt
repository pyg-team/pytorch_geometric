CAUSE
Several possible causes. It may any of the following or a combination.
1) User does not have a license for Statistics 21 Complex Samples Module.
2) User has a single or concurrent license for SPSS Base and the Add-On license for Statistics 21 Complex Samples Module also has Base included.
3) User does have a license for Statistics Complex Samples Module but it is for another version of Statistics.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows 7
IBM SPSS Statistics 21

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Purchase and active a license for Statistics 21 Complex Samples Module.
If the user has already purchased and activated a Statistics 21 Complex Samples Module, and has either a single or concurrent license for base; make sure that the Statistics 21 Complex Samples Module is a stand-alone module and does not have 'Base' also attached to the license.
