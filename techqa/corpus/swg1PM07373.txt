PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  setupwas.sh - *Error*  Unable to determine WAS version
   
   This is what comes out of versionInfo.sh when the Italian locale
   is used.
   
   Env. DC 6.1 FP5 on zWAS 6.1.0.27
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Use of a locale will cause the output of the WAS
   versionInfo.sh script to put out messages that we were not
   expecting, causing the WAS version detection code to fail in
   setupwas.sh.
