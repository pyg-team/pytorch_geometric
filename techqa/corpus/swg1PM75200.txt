   RAM will not delete *.tmp file even if release() is called.
   
   
   
   
   1. Problem description and statement
   Customer reports over 100Mb of tmp files in his server's
   /tmp folder
   
   2. Customer Environment
   RAM 7.5.1
   Buildforge server
   WAS backend
   RTC included
   RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.8
   
   3. When did this start happening? Did this always happen?
   What changed?
   Always happened
   
   4. Customer Impact ?
   Disk space constraints on their servers
   
   5. What does Support expect from the Development team?
   Confirm defect or configuration options to turn this feature
   off.
   
   
   6. Research and Reproduction steps
   
   ? ? * A. What did you find from reviewing existing
   documentation and SME?
   Nothing
   
   ? ? * B1. Is the problem reproducible? What are the steps to
   reproduce.
   We use RAM API as part of build process to execute some
   tasks. After
   the tasks are executed, we see lot of logging is written to
   the '/tmp'
   folder on the BuildEngine server (this is the server where
   the Java
   coding using the RAM api is executed).
   
   The logging consists of information from RAM, like
   Communities,
   Lifecycles, workflows etc...Normally, it's expected that
   this
   information will be cleaned-up after the execution. But it
   stays on the
   server.
   
   
   7. Attachment(s) Specify which file is for what and where to
   find them.
   ? ? * A. Do we have a test-case? If no, why not?
   ? ? * B. What other related files do we have?
   
   1. Directory listing of customer's tmp folder
   2. Example .tmp files
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now the *.tmp file can be deleted automatically after each
   execution. the Customer can also set the cache folder to
   where they want using
   System.setProperty("com.ibm.ram.client.rest.cacheFolder",?ca
   cheFolderPath?), then delete the folder manually;
