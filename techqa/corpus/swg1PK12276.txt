ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Rational Software Architect Windows 6.0.1
   
   Description of problem:
   When working with the XML source Page Editor for
   non .xml files the encoding is overwritten
   so the German special characters are corrupted
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround:
   There are 2 workarounds, you can choose what is easier to use
   1- Rename the file to be .xml and save and then rename again to
   .enum
   2- You can create a linked resource for it and link it with an
   xml file, as the following
   go to window->preferences->workbench->linked resources
    press New -> press file -> select the enum file and name as you
   want (ex: enum_file)
   In project, select new -> other -> simple -> file
    press advanced -> check link to file in the file system ->
   press variable -> select the wanted variable -> in the file name
   put file.xml (must be .xml to work)
   You can test it by editing the linked file (file.xml) save it,
   and then look at the file.enum and you will see the changes are
   there.
