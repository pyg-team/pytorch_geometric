Title: IBM Configuring IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) profile on Ubuntu 16.04 fails because of wrong Java version - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to create the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) deployment manager profile on Ubuntu 16.04 with a silent installation, the configuration fails because WebSphere Application Server installs Java 6 instead of Java 8.


SYMPTOM
The configuration fails. You might see the following error in the log: 

Configuring the deployment manager.
Creating the deployment manager profile.
The following validation errors were present with the command line arguments:
profileName: CWMCF8510E: You cannot augment a profile with Business Process Manager when the active Java version is 1.6. Use the managesdk command to switch to a supported Java version: [1.8].
CWMCB0003E: A profile was not created for DmgrProfile.


CAUSE
If you install WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5.12 on Ubuntu 16.4 with the Installation Manager silent mode and option -properties user.wasjava=java8 or with the response file mode and setting, embedded Java 6 is installed instead of Java 8.
