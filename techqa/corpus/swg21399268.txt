QUESTION
 How do I use Workflow Subscription Trace Logging to troubleshoot FileNet P8 Content Engine issues? 

CAUSE
Event Action Trace Logging is used to troubleshoot workflow object event and subscription issues.

ANSWER
By default, the P8 system enables Event Action Tracing once a workflow subscription is launched. It cannot be disabled.


Data to collect: 

 * The event action log is named vweventaction.trc, and is created in C:\Document & Settings\<username_that_starts_CEService>. 
 * Provide a description of the events leading up to the issue along with any server error logs. 
 * Document the time at which the issue occurred.


For more information: The vweventaction.trc log is currently an undocumented P8 troubleshooting tool, and therefore there is no further information available.
