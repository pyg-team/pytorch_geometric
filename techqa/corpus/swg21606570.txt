Title: IBM Settings are disabled with Taskmaster Application Manager in IBM Datacap - United States

Text:
application manager restricted grey gray disabled blank TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When bringing up settings in Taskmaster Application Manager, the settings are grayed out and cannot be changed. 

SYMPTOM
An alternative symptom is that Application Manager does not completely render. Applications may list at the left but the tabs are missing and the main section is completely blank.


CAUSE
A number of issues can cause this behavior. 

 * The application file has been previously locked, e.g. by another user. 
 * A restricted version of Taskmaster Application Manager is being used. 
 * The user does not have sufficient permissions to write to configuration files. 
 * An issue with the original install prevented Taskmaster from being fully installed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct, do the following as needed until the problem is corrected. 

 1. In the application folder, check to see if a file exists named (application).app.lock. If it does, delete it. 
 2. Install Datacap Studio on the station from which Taskmaster Application Manager is being run. 
 3. Close any client applications that have the ability to edit the app file. This would include additional copies of Taskmaster Application Manager, even if running on a different station. 
 4. Rerun setup and select Repair when prompted.
