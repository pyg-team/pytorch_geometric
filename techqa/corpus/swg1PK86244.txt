APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access Protocol user
   registries" topic in the Information Centers for IBM WebSphere
   Application Server Versions 6.1 and 7.0 explain how to
   configure a stand alone LDAP server. Step 14 discusses how to
   enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication with the LDAP
   server.However, this step is incomplete. The step needs to
   explain that the signer certificate from the LDAP server needs
   to be added to the truststore that will be used.
   -
   The steps should explain that the signer certificate of the LDAP
   certificate needs to be extracted to a file. That file needs to
   be sent to the Websphere Application Server machine and then
   added to the truststore that is being defined for the LDAP
   server. If this step is not done, an error is issued by the
   administrative console. Also, the deployment manager
   systemout.log file shows a CWPKI0022E: SSL HANDSHAKE FAILURE
   error. The extended error message from the SSL handshake
   exception is:
   "PKIX path building failed:
   java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException:
   unable to find valid certification path to requested target"

   ****************************************************************
   The "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access protocol user
   registries" topic omits important information involving the
   SSL enabled option to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
   communications with the LDAP server. The use of this option is
   successful if the Signer certificate for the LDAP server is
   first added to the truststore that will be eventually used in
   the communications process. The Information Center for
   WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.1 and 7.0 does not
   highlight this information. Without following this process,
   the administrative console will issue a CWPKI0022E: SSL
   HANDSHAKE FAILURE  error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access Protocol user
   registries" topic will be updated to include a reminder to add
   the signer certificate for the LDAP server to the truststore
   that will be eventually used in the communication. The
   following text will be added:
   
   Important: This step will only be successful provided that the
   Signer certificate for the LDAP is first added to the
   truststore that will be eventually used. If the Signer
   certificate from the LDAP is not added to the truststore, then:
   - An error will be issued by the Administrative console.
   - T he deployment manager (DMGR) systemout.log will show the
   CWPKI0022E: SSL HANDSHAKE FAILURE message indicating that the
   Signer certificate needs to be added to the truststore.
   
   To ensure an error free operation for this step, you need to
   first extract to a file the Signer certificate of the LDAP and
   send that file to the WebSphere Application Server machine.
   You can then add the certificate to the truststore being
   defined for the LDAP. In this way, you are assured that the
   remaining actions for this step will be successful.
