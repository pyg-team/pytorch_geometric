APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The SOAP specifications changed the namespace for the XML
   elements used in the SOAP envelope, and they did so in a way
   that was not backward-compatible, so our XPath expressions that
   were written for SOAP 1.1 are not finding the proper elements in
   SOAP 1.2
   
   Users Affected:
   Users of ITCAM for SOA and SOAP 1.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ITCAM for SOA .NET agent searched for the SOAP 1.1
   namespace only, it did not search for the SOAP 1.2 namespace.
   This caused the agent not to find the SOAP 1.2 header and insert
   a header of its own, resulting in a message with both a SOAP 1.1
   and 1.2 header.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ITCAM for SOA .NET agent was modified to support SOAP 1.2
   headers.  The agent will first search for a 1.1 header, and if
   it does not find it will search for a 1.2 header.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  NA
