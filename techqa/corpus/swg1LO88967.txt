ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For web application, the customer created a button which
   includes two simple @ commands, but it didn't work and the
   server returned error message.
   However, each command can work individually.
   
   In the sample database "SimpleMailOpenURL.nsf", there is a form
   "teest" and it has three buttons, Btn1, Btn2 and Btn3.
   Btn1 and Btn2 were prepared for L2's investigation, and Btn3 is
   original button which causes the problem.
   
   Btn1 includes @URLOpen command. It calls JavaScript which is
   written in HTML Head Content.
   By clicking this button, a cursor will focus on the text box
   "c_cc".
   This button can work on the web.
   
   Btn2 includes @Command and RunAgent command. It calls the agent
   "Mailsoshin".
   By clicking this button, a mail is sent to specific user.
   This button can work on the web.
   
   Btn3 includes the above two commands.
   By clicking this button, server returns error message "Internet
   Explorer cannot display the webpage".
