Title: IBM Exit code = 1 during Rational Application Developer installation - United States

Text:
installation error; install exit; code memory heap; 18285; 999; 000; 1253803 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While installing Rational速 Application Developer (RAD) 6.x on a Microsoft速 Windows速 operating system, during the final phase where Eclipse速 is being initialized, the install terminates with an Exit code = 1. 

CAUSE
This problem might be caused by a memory allocation error.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To verify that memory allocation is the cause of the error in your particular instance, start RAD from the command-line by opening a command-prompt, changing the directory to 

{RADInstallDir}\eclipse directory and type the following: 

jre\bin\java -Xj9
-Dosgi.adaptor=org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseAdaptor
-cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main > errors.txt 2>&1

Look for an error similar to this error being reported in the errors.txt file

Error message captured: 
JVMJ9VM015W Initialization error for library 
j9gc22(5): Failed to instantiate heap. 1078294K requested
Could not create the Java virtual machine 

If you get a similar error you can work around the problem by limiting the amount of memory requested for the heap. Add the following line to the rationalsdp.ini file (near where similar values are set) that is located in the RAD installation directory

VMArgs=-Xmx512M 

then restart RAD from the command-line in the RAD installation directory using this command:

rationalsdp.exe -clean 

You need to run this only once, after which you can then use the normal shortcut to launch RAD.
