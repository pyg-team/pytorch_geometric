Title: IBM Collecting Data for IBM BigFix OS Deployment (OSD) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logs and data to collect for troubleshooting IBM BigFix OSD issues. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An assortment of different data and logs can be captured at each steps of the OSD deployment process. 

Capture Phase

The first place that things might go wrong with the capture process is during the actual running of the Multiple Action Group created by the Capture Dashboard. If anywhere during the MAG something fails it will be reflected in the action summary. This would be your typical BigFix action failures, files not existing, downloads failed or not available, unable to delete files, etc. Identifying the line of actionscript that failed and basic troubleshooting may help determine what caused the issue.

Logs: C:\Windows\Temp\Deployment Logs\

After the capture process (Bigfix action) has completed, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) will start.
mdt Logs can be in a number of places

MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit) Phase

Potential MDT Log can be found in a number of locations:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *

Reimage (Windows) Phase

Reimage (Linux) Phase 

During the Linux Re-imaging process, all the deployment logs are stored on the target machine at the following path: 

<BESClient_Folder>/__BESData/__Global/Logs/DeploymentLogs (default: /var/opt/BESClient/__BESData/__Global/Logs/DeploymentLogs)

Bare Metal Server Setup 

C:\Program Files\Common Files\IBM ( ManifestImport.log, mkgenericsysprof.log, temimportwpe.log, etc. These files should provide insight in why the sync commands might failed. 

Bare Metal Deployments 

Bare metal deployments are initiated by a target endpoint PXE booting and contacting a set up TPMfOSD server. 

TPMfOSD server and reported to the Activity dashboard automatically. Detailed logs are found C:\TPMfOSFiles\global\hostactivities\task<nnnnnnnnn>. 


Offline Media 

Logs are located on the OS Deployment Server (Bare Metal Server) 

C:\Program Files\Common Files\IBM Tivoli  *

Errors while uploading files through console 

When you import files using the Console (for example, when you upload an MDT Bundle, images, or drivers) all temporary files and logs used during the import process are stored in the Console working directory: 

%USERPROFILE%\OSDeployment 

If any errors occur during the import step, you can troubleshoot the problem by analyzing the general trace file %USERPROFILE%\OSDeployment\rbagent.trc. 

All files being uploaded are tracked in the %USERPROFILE%\OSDeployment\UploadManagerFiles folder. 
Sync failures

C:\Program Files\Common Files\IBM Tivoli (bare metal server)
.log and .trc files 


 

Additional Information 

 

See Collecting Data: IBM BigFix [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21505708] for the basic required information to provide Support when opening a PMR. 

The OSD problem you are experiencing may also be due to an issue with the operation of the BigFix platform components or deployment. 

Please determine if the BigFix platform components and deployment are working as expected before proceeding to collect OSD specific data. 

For OSD specific data: please see the Troubleshooting [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS63NW_9.5.0/com.ibm.bigfix.lifecycle.doc/Lifecycle/OSD_Users_Guide/c_maint_and_troubleshoot.html] section of the OS Deployment User's Guide for data to collect [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS63NW_9.5.0/com.ibm.bigfix.lifecycle.doc/Lifecycle/OSD_Users_Guide/c_logs.html].
