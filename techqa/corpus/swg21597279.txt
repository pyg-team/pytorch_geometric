 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The number of processors reported by the Processors panel for the machines where the product is installed is higher than the value on Current Capacity (Manage Software Inventory) panel. 

SYMPTOM
A given PVU product is being detected by a certain number of agents with the total of X cores. 

On Current Capacity (Manage Software Inventory) panel the number of cores reported for these agents is lower than X.

CAUSE
The number of cores for which a customer is being charged may be capped as explained here:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check if any of the rules explained in Virtualization Capacity Licensing for IBM Power Systems PowerVM Virtualization do not affect the calculations. 

 

Please review the results of : 'lparstat -i' for the affected machines. 

It is possible, that either the LPAR itself is capped (value for the Mode parameter), or there is a limit set on the corresponding Shared Pool ( Active CPUs in Pool ).
