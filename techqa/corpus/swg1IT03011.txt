APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Record and replay thread does not release its database
   connections
   after the idle timeout has expired. This can result in an error
   if the firewall or database server terminates the connection
   after a certain period of inactivity. The following are possible
   errors seen if the database used to record data is Oracle:
   
   BIP2322E: Database error: SQL State '08S01'; Native Error Code
   '-4'; Error Text '[unixODBC][IBM][ODBC Oracle Wire Protocol
   driver][Oracle]Connection Dead.'. :
   
   BIP2322E: Database error: SQL State 'HY000'; Native Error Code
   '-6'; Error Text '[unixODBC][IBM][ODBC Oracle Wire Protocol

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Record and replay threads do not release their database
   connections after the idle timeout has expired. This can result
   in an error if the firewall or database server terminates the
   connection after a certain period of inactivity. The following
   are possible errors seen if the database used to record data is
   Oracle.
   
   BIP2322E: Database error: SQL State '08S01'; Native Error Code

   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Record and replay threads are now configured to release idle
   database connections after the default idle timeout of 60
   seconds. The idle timeout value is configurable as described in
   the IBM Knowledge Center, page ac00406_.htm
