APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The MQOutput node acquires a handle to open the queue before
   putting the message to the queue. If the MQPUT fails and
   returns a coupling facility (CF) failure reason code, the queue
   handle will no longer be valid:
   
   2345 MQRC_CF_NOT_AVAILABLE
   2373 MQRC_CF_STRUC_FAILED
   
   When the CF is recovered, the node will continue to use the
   invalid handle to put to the queue. Without this APAR fix, the
   execution group needs restarting for the node to acquire a new
   queue handle.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The MQOutput node acquires a handle to open the queue before
   putting the message to the queue. If the MQPUT fails and returns
   a coupling facility (CF) failure reason code, the queue handle
   will no longer be valid:
   
   2345 MQRC_CF_NOT_AVAILABLE

 *  The product now recognises the MQRC_CF reason codes in the event
   of an MQPUT failure.
