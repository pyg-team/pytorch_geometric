PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Get a library am_sun_16 error when starting a monitored WebLogic Server v12.1.3 on Linux. 

SYMPTOM
This error is seen when attempting to start a configured WebLogic Server v12.1.3 after configuring it with ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0.2 or higher. This is the error seen during startup: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=1]


CAUSE
This is caused due to the missing reference to the 32-bit library in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


ENVIRONMENT
Linux



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are the steps to resolve this problem: 

1. Navigate to the directory where your startup script is located. In my case, am using the default domain 'base_domain', so my startup script is here:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=2]

2. Make a backup of your startup script. In my case, its startWebLogic.sh, the default startup script.

3. Modify the startWebLogic.sh script, and search for "DC for Weblogic support". This is the stanza that ITCAM addes during the configuration phase. In here, change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to the 32-bit library like this. (Note: If you are on another Unix OS, use the right sub-directory name accordingly.)

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968702&aid=3]

4. Save the file, and restart the WebLogic server using the startup script.

5.You should now be able to restart the server successfully without any errors. It will look something like this during the startup. Note that the am_sun_16 library is now picked up successfully.

Note: This error was seen on a 64-bit RHEL6.6 Linux system using WebLogic v12.1.3 configured with ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0.2. It may also occur on other WebLogic versions on other OS.
