ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using 7.0 and I got the same results in IDA 7.5.1.
   Scott says it is as designed. However, the techrep would like an
    RFE submitted.
   He stated:
   I understand the concept of 'Work as designed'. I'm just wonderi
   ng why
   it was designed this way. What if somebody just wanted to map th
   e  model
   manually? Why would the tool start matching the attributes befor
   e  asked
   Wouldn't that be a waste of time if the user didn't care about t
   he
   mapping the tool found? And why would the tool do the matching e
   very
   time it opens up the mapping file that has been created?
   
   I assume we are not the only ones encountering this problem. And
    in the
   database world, I bet there are bigger models than ours. The map
   ping
   feature is supposed to be a big selling point for RDA/IDA. When
   it  take
   6+ hours to use the feature, it looks more like a defect to me.
   But I
   don't want to be hung up on the terminology. I think we should f
   ix this
   problem.
   
   It'd be great if you could submit an RFE for this. ??
   
   Attached is a project that you may use to reproduce.
   The steps are:
   Import project to IDA, select ldm or dbm file, right click and s
   elect map as target (or source).
   Select the other ldm or dbm file as a source (or target). And fi
   nish.
   IDA sits with an hour glass for a while.
   The techrep said it did come back but after 6 hours.
   
   I tried to go to go to Window?Preferences?Model Validation? unch
   eck the Object Name  under
   the logical model settings.  Thinking that analyzing before mapp
   ing may be the tim econsumig factor. But it didn't help.
