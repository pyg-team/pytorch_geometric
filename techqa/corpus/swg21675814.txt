PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A User may get the error below when trying to create a page in DASH using the table widget for Web GUI data source. Error is displayed as soon as the data set is selected.

TCTUI1003E An error has occurred communicating with the server 

SYMPTOM
There are no obvious errors in the DASH (Dashboard Application Services Hub) or Web GUI logs specific to this issue. No columns are shown in the optional settings of the table widget configuration panel after you select the data set.


CAUSE
This issue can occur if a user has defined a custom AEL view in Web GUI but left the Label field empty for a view column. This label field is optional in Web GUI and can have any string including null. The table widget in DASH does not expect any empty values, so to avoid this issue make sure that label field is not empty. 

An APAR was opened to fix this issue: IV61421. This APAR is fixed in JazzSM 1.1.2.1 so this technote is only applicable to earlier versions. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue make sure the Label field is not empty(blank).
