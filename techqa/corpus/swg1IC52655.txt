PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server version 6.0.2   *
   *                 using an WebSphere MQ binding on a           *
   *                 mediation, using the normal                  *
   *                 develop->test->modify->test                  *
   *                 cycle in WebSphere Integration Developer,    *
   *                 not using the rebuild all option             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When the user develops a mediation      *
   *                      module with a WebSphere MQ binding for  *
   *                      their export or import and deploys and  *
   *                      tests it, then modifies some of the     *
   *                      attributes of the WebSphere MQ export   *
   *                      or import and redeploys the module,     *
   *                      then a MediationRuntimeException is     *
   *                      seen when testing the module.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the fix to resolve the problem. This   *
   *                 is currently targetted for version 6.0.2.2   *
   ****************************************************************
   The code responsible for generating the mediation deployment
   artefacts was not invoked when the user modified the binding
   properties of the import or export. The fix ensures that the
   mediation deployment artefacts generator is invokes in this
   case and generates the necessary resources.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix fully resolves the problem.
