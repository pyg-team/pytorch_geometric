ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I am using SPSS OEM 6.1 DB2 Wire protocol. If I do not use
   encryption, I succeed in connecting to an unencrypted DB2
   database. If I use encryption, I cannot connect to an encrypted
   DB:
   
   On the odbc driver setup under the security tab, I change the
   Authentication Method from the default of 0 - No Encryption to
   2- Encrypt UID and Password.  I also change the encryption
   method from 0- No Encryption to 2- Database encrypt.  Then I
   attempt to connect to a db2 database which is set up for
   Encryption and receive the following error
   
   [DataDirect][ODBC DB2 Wire Protocol driver]Unable to dynamically
   load client DLL XEssl25.DLL.
   
   In fact this dll does not reside in the installation directory:
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSSOEM\odbc64v61\Drivers
   
   but instead the XEssl25.DLL resides in the extract directory
   where I extracted the installation:
   C:\Users\Administrator\SDAP61\Program Files
   64\IBM\SPSSOEM\odbc64v61\Drivers
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Adding that path to the PATH environment variable resolves the
   issue.
