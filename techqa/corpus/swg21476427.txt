Title: IBM Single / Site licenses cannot be installed on servers running NT Terminal Server. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to install a Single User or Site License of an SPSS product on a Windows 2003 /2008 Server operating system and encountering one of the following alerts after entering my license information:
1. Single user licenses cannot be installed on servers running NT Terminal Server
2. The license code entered is not valid.

Why can't I install the software? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Windows 2003/2008 Server editions have NT Terminal Server technology built into the operating system which allows for multiple users to access a single copy of the software. This is a violation of the single user license agreement. Please install the software on client versions of the operating system, such as Windows XP Professional or obtain a Network client license
