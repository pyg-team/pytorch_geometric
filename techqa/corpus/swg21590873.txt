Title: IBM Fix Pack 7.0.0.2 fails with 'license not found' - United States

Text:
license directory not found FP 2 upgrade Portal 7 Fix Pack 7.0.0.2 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The 7.0.0.2 Fix Pack executes a ConfigEngine script called 'action-set-license-home-mp'. This script checks to see if the license directory is present and sets a property for this during the upgrade. If the Portal server does not have this directory, then the upgrade may fail at this point.

SYMPTOM
Fix Pack 7.0.0.2 fails with this error in the ConfigTrace:

========================================= 

 

License directory will be missing at this location: 

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/PortalServer/license

CAUSE
Installing Portal Enable/Extend using a silent install allows for the option to set "server" as the entitlement agreement. This option is not available through the GUI for Portal Enable/Extend. It should only be used for the Portal server offering if you set it for a silent install..



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if the license directory is missing at this location: 

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/PortalServer/license



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy the license directory over from another Portal 7 environment. It does not necessarily have to match the exact version of the current Portal 7 environment. If there is not one available, contact IBM support to supply one for you.
