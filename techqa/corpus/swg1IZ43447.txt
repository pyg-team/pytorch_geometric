ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITM 6.1 FP01 LA07 Windows Oracle agent does not start.
   HUB/RTEMS/TEP are AIX ITM 6.1 FP06IF03. Installation of the
   Oracle agent completes,
   but then the Oracle agent does not start. IT gives the following
   error:
   The service did not respond to the start or control request in a
   timely fashion.
   The windows OS agent is at 06.10.06.02.
   The reason for some machine have such problems is , at windows
   box, oracle agent need the oracle's dll location path at system
   path. At the problem machine, this oracle's dll location was
   not added at system path.
   WHY is it not added to the system path? Is this sa failure in
   the install of the agent or a failure in the install of Oracle
   itself?
   
   --> It is the install of Oracle itself.
   
   HOW can it be rectified and why does our install not check that
   the path it there??
   
   --> There is no better remedy for this issue. Even the installer
   of Oracle Agent add %ORACLE_HOME%\bin to PATH, the machine need
   to reboot because the Windows Service's enviroment variable is
   not update until reboot.
   
   I believe that this is an APAR in that we need to check the path
   and if the oracle bin is NOT there we need to add it and
   tell the customer to reboot OR need to indicate to them that
   this needs to be done so that we do not get the misleading
   microsoft error message in the future.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The root cause is, the oracle database server's bin path was not
   at system path environment variable.
   Even if the customer add the oracle database server's bin path
   at system path, it's required to reboot the machine at customer
   side to make sure the system path take effect.
   Below are the steps which don't need to reboot the machine to
   make sure system path take effect
   Step 1. Add oracle database server's bin path to system path, in
   this case, the path is "D:\oracle\ora10g\bin".
   Step 2. Specify an userid (can not be LocalSystem) to start the
   oracle agent -- which user have the correct permission to
   access oracle database. For example, "testuser"
   
   start the oracle agent from "tivoli monitoring control panel",
   then oracle agent should be started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases: Oracle Agent startup fails
   with the following error message:
   "The service did not respond to the start or control request in
   a timely fashion."
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In some cases, the path of %ORACLE_HOME%\bin is not added to the
   system path environment variable after the installation of the
   Oracle database. As a result, the agent cannot locate the Oracle
   DLL files and fails to start.
