Collecting troubleshooting data for Syndication issues with IBM Web Content Manager (WCM) V7.0 expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Troubleshooting 
Collecting troubleshooting data for Syndication with WCM V7.0 expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. If you already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WCM, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21444911]. 

Syndication specific information 
Use this document if you are having issues an existing syndication or if you are having issues with the setup for syndication 

Questions 
Here are some questions that should be answered along with completing the data collection below. Please be sure to include these answers along with your submission: 

1. Is this the first time you are you syndicating to this subscriber? If not, what changes have been made since the last successful syndication between these two servers? 

2. Are you syndicating between one syndicator and one subscriber or are there multiple relationships set up? If multiples, please provide details. 

3. Is your syndicator or subscriber part of a cluster? If so, please describe the details of the syndication relationship (syndicating to primary node, all nodes, and so on). 

4. Are you syndicating multiple libraries in the same definition? Do you have a separate design/component library from content? If so, are you syndicating the libraries together? 

5. Are you syndicating All items or Live Items or Live Items and Projects ? 

6. Is this automatic or manual syndication? 

7. Are the syndicator and subscriber pointing to the same ldap? If different ldaps then are the users and groups identical? 

8. Have you done any authoring on the subscriber? 

9. If you are doing an all items syndication, is versioning enabled on the syndicator? 

Manual collection of troubleshooting data 
I. Enabling trace logging 
Enable tracing during problem recreation in order to investigate the specific behavior of the component(s). Choose to enable either static or dynamic tracing and proceed with the steps accordingly. For further information regarding logging and tracing in the portal, refer to the System event logging [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/System_event_logging_wp7] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/trouble/pd_intr_logs.html] topic in the IBM WebSphere Portal 7.0 Information Center. Note that the traces need to be enabled on BOTH the syndicator and subscriber servers. 

Option A: Enabling static (extended) tracing 
Static tracing is the recommended method of capturing data, as it collects data from server startup until problem recreation. 

1. Log into the Integrated Solutions Console as the WebSphere Application Server administrator. 
2. Click Troubleshooting->Logs and Trace->WebSphere_Portal->Diagnostic Trace. 
3. On the Configuration tab, ensure Enable Log is selected. On this same tab, increase the Maximum File Size and and Maximum Number of Historical Files to ensure that the tracing of recreation is not overwritten due to the amount of traffic on the system and output of the tracing itself. 
4. Click Change Log Level Details and enter the following trace string: *=info:com.aptrix.deployment.*=all:com.aptrix.syndication.*=all 5. Click OK and save the changes. 
6. Restart the WebSphere_Portal application server. 

Option B: Enabling dynamic tracing 
Dynamic tracing can be used for situations that do not permit a server restart. 

1. Log in as the Portal administrator. 
2. Click Administration->Portal Analysis->Enable Tracing. 
3. Type the required trace string into the field Append these trace settings: *=info:com.aptrix.deployment.*=all:com.aptrix.syndication.*=all 4. Click the Add icon. Enable Tracing updates the "Current trace settings" field.  * NOTE 1:

II. Collecting and submitting logs and configuration data 
Reproduce the problem and immediately copy (if possible) the trace logs to prevent rolling over. Confirm that the timestamp for the issue is included in the trace logs, and then collect the following information for review (from both the syndicator and subscriber server): 
 * wp_profile/logs/WebSphere_Portal directory 
 * wp_profile/logs/ffdc directory 
 * wp_profile/PortalServer/log/VersionInfo.log Send the diagnostic information to IBM Support: [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449992&amp;aid=1] Follow instructions to send diagnostic information to IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571] and be sure to provide all diagnostic information captured above. This requires that a PMR be opened if not already.
   
   Refer to the detailed instructions in "Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]" to make the information available and to update your problem record. 


NOTE: When sending in logs for review, include any relevant screenshots, timestamps, userIds, and so on, in order to expedite analysis of the issue.
