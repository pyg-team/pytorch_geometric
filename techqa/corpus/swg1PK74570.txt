APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM 6.1.3 IF12 Data Collector Silent installation.
   Autoconfigure during silent installation does not work when the
   MS is using Oracle Database.
   
   The new jar worked. There were two problems in
   kerenel.core/src/java/com/cyanea/kernel/core/AutoConfiguration.j
   ava
   
   Oracle sql was wrong: It returned no data initially.
   The correct sql that worked is  : sql = "select c.CONFIG_ID,
   c.CONFIG_NAME, c.EXCLUDE, c.EXCLUDE_OVERRIDE, c.MQENABLED,
   cc.EXCLUDE,
   cc.EXCLUDE_OVERRIDE from CONFIG c LEFT OUTER JOIN CONFIG cc ON
   c.MQENABLED = cc.CONFIG_ID ";
   
   and the line Integer temp = (Integer) rs.getObject(4); was
   throwing
   BigInteger Classcast exception.
   the correct way to do is: Integer temp  =
   Integer.valueOf(rs.getObject(4).toString());
