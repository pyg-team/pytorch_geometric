ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has uploaded the following IBM WebSphere SDK Java
   Technology Edition 7.1 fix package to the IBM Installation
   Manager Repository on the PureApplication System:
   
   7.1.3.10_0001-WS-IBMWASJAVA-Linux.zip
   
   The package is not available from the instance console
   (maintenance operation) under "maintenance fixes" or
   "maintenance fixpacks". Since they cannot select it, they can
   not apply the fix to the virtual machine instances.

   To confirm that APAR IT14680 is the root cause of a problem
   where a fix is not listed properly on the Manage > Maintenance
   page:
   
   Confirm that Installation Manager lists the fix as available:
   - SSH onto the virtual machine where the fix needs to be applied
   - Update your SSH tool settings so that the commands you issue
     and their output are saved in a file
   - Issue the following commands
   
   sudo -u virtuser ./imcl listAvailableFixes <fix-name>
   -repositories http://IBMWorkloadDeployer:8585/IMRepository/Compo [http://IBMWorkloadDeployer:8585/IMRepository/Compo]
   
   where <fix-name> is the name of the fix to be applied, for
   example:
   
   sudo -u virtuser ./imcl listAvailableFixes
   com.ibm.websphere.liberty.ND.v85_8.5.5009.20160227_1546
   -repositories http://IBMWorkloadDeployer:8585/IMRepository/Compo [http://IBMWorkloadDeployer:8585/IMRepository/Compo]
   
   
   
   
   If an external Installation Manager Repository is also
   available, also issue
   
   sudo -u virtuser ./imcl listAvailableFixes <fix-name>
   -repositories http://<external-IM-repository> [http://<external-IM-repository>]
   
   where <fix-name> is the name of the fix to be applied, and
   <external-IM-repository>  is the URL for the external IM
   repository.
   
   
   
   Enable tracing to collect logs with fixpack calculation
   information included:
   
   - Select System > Workload Troubleshooting
   - Add a trace for
     "com.ibm.maestro.mgmt.resources.IfixMgmtResource"
   - Set the trace level to ALL
   - Recreate the problem
   - Wait 2 hours
   - Select System > Workload Troubleshooting again
   - Download All Logs
        (take care *not* to choose Download Latest Logs)
   - Provide the trace.zip file to IBM support
   
   
   To review the logs for information
   - Unzip trace.zip and look for servers.zip
   - Unzip servers.zip
   - Unzip the Kernel Services logs inside servers.zip
   - Review the Kernel Services logs for log entries from
     IfixMgmtResource.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The code checking if a fix is applicable to a product installed
   on a virtual machine was expecting to compare versions for
   maintenance in the V.R.M.F formart (version, release,
   maintenance, fix). The Java fix had an unhandled version
   format.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.2.0.0.
