APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TWS 9.2 prerequisite checker returns this warning and stops
   :
   
   AWSFAB231W The prerequisite scan detected missing prerequisites.
   Check
   the prerequisite scan logs, precheck_result.txt and result.txt,
   located
   in the installation log folder, for details. The installation
   continues
   if you did not specify the -stoponcheckprereq flag.
   
   result.txt shows only Solaris 10 as supported and that is wrong.
   
   Solaris 11 is supported and this should be corrected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run twsinst again without -stoponcheckprereq
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   This will be fixed into 9.2 FP3, 9.3 FP3
   and 9.4 GA.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
