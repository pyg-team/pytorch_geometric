INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 

Review the installation instructions. Terms and Conditions: By downloading, installing, copying, accessing or using this software you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in the License Agreement. Please review the License Agreement [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/aix/products/ccpp/xlc.rte.aix.13.1.2/LicenseAgreement.pdf] and License Information [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/aix/products/ccpp/xlc.rte.aix.13.1.2/license.pdf] documents prior to proceeding with download or installation.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
You can install this software using the System Management and Installation Tool (SMIT) utility.

You must log on as root or have the superuser authority.

To install this software using the SMIT interface, follow these steps:



 1. Download the desired package.
 2. 
 3. Uncompress and untar each package into a separate empty directory, using the following command:zcat .tar.Z | tar -xf - 
    
    
 4. 
 5. Run the following command:smit install_latest
    
    This command invokes SMIT, which presents a menu-driven user interface for the installation process.
    First specify the INPUT device/directory of the software by typing in the name of the directory that contains the extracted package.
    
    
 6. 
 7. If you have read the license agreement and agree to its terms, you must select yes next to Accept new LICENSE agreements? to continue with the installation.
 8. 
 9. The default values can be modified according to your preferences.


Notes: 

 * You must install the Runtime environment package before installing the Utilities package, if you install both packages.
 * To ensure that all necessary filesets are installed, keep the default setting of SOFTWARE to install as _all_latest; otherwise, you have to specify the filesets individually.
 * You can preview the installation process without installing the software by selecting yes next to the Preview only? field.
 * Press Enter when you are done customizing the options to start the installation process.
   Installation starts and messages are displayed as each part is installed. The installation log is stored to the $HOME/smit.log file.
 * If you select _all_latest, SMIT will attempt to install all runtime filesets. As a result, you might see the failed installation status for some message catalog filesets because of missing prerequisites. Ignore those errors if you do not need the runtime message catalog(s) for the national language(s).
 * If you do not have the associated filesets (bos.loc.*) installed for a specific locale, the runtime message filesets (xlC.msg.*) will fail to install.
