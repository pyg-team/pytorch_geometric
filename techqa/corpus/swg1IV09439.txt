ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR IZ90711 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ90711] - was originally opened against Maximo 7.1.1.7,
   originally Dev flagged this as not a bug with the explanation:
    "If the field is required on the form, whether displayed or
   not, it validates workaround: conditionally change the
   inputmode on the control inside the container to not be
   required if not visible"
   
   Later Comments:
   
   " I've seen something similar to this before.  I'm not sure what
   changed or how this was working in 7.1.1.6 but unfortunately
   hiding and showing a field is not the proper way to make a
   field required or not.
   The good news is, in 7.5 this has been resolved and hiding a
   required field will no longer make the field required but a
   number of framework changes (both Mbo and UI) were made to
   allow this to happen.   I'm going to investigate what changed.
   "
   
   Dev then thought they had a viable fix and they provide a Hotfix
   for this issue however that fix later had to be backed out as ;
   "Development couldn't fix it in a hotfix without degrading
   performance.
   Its addressed in the next major release Maximo 7.5 (i.e. the
   current 7.1 design cannot handle this without performance
   trade-off.  It is an enhancement has been implemented in 7.5
   which involves a major re-design of Maximo)."
   
   They did provide another workaround:
   
   "... add the sigoption to the textbox control directly, instead
   of the section container. Let me know if there are still any
   problems after they do that. "
   
   At this point the Fix is listed as being in the latest 7.1.1.8
   hotfix but is being "backed out" as it causes other issues and
   the issues mentioned above.
   
   Current Dev conclusion : This is not a bug in the Maximo 7.1.x
   version and it beyond the scope of a patch or Hotfix to change.
   
   Since the Tpae has backed out the fix due to frame work issue,
   TPM will fix this locally.
   
   ACTION PLAN:
   Reroute to L2 to open APAR.
   Please let me know the APAR number and I will open internal
   defect to fix this.
   
   Initial Problem :
   
   I cannot modify the CloudFileRepository object.
   
   .
   For example I need to change the IP Address for the file server,
   and when I save the change, the error is...
   .
   BMXAA4195E required field protocol is blank
   .
   I was hoping to workaround the error by creating an XML for a
   new FileRepository, but the import fails, and I cannot
   determine the exact xml syntax required.
   .
   A. We should be able to change the IP Address of the file server
   B. Can you provide working syntax of XML to create a new
   FileRepository?
