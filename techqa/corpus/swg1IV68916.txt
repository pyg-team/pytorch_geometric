APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to start discovery in the discovery management
   portal, or access the scopes, the action may hang and never
   return. This problem has been observed in TADDM 7222 and 730.
   
   This typically occurs if the scope on the anchors or gateways
   have been modified in any way.
   
   In the javaws log, you will see the last action is getScopeSets;
   
   
   (ServerFacade)DEBUG Calling the server to perform :
   com.collation.proxy.clientproxy.server.action.ScopeProxyCommand:
   getScopeSets on version:0
   
   In the TADDM discovery server ClientProxy log you will see the
   same method called but never see it return on that thread;

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no workaround other then if you restart the PSS you can
   see the scopes on the PSS. However if you use the DS to see
   scopes they will be blocked again. An efix is the only
   correction.
