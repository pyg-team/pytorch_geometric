Title: IBM Excel link spreadsheet values are zero (0) after upgrade to Controller 10.1.2163 or later - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User opens Excel link spreadsheet (XLSX file). User refreshes/runs report (e.g. via F9). Many of the values change to zero (0), even though there is data inside the system.
This report worked OK in the past (for that user), before the system was upgraded (to 10.1.2163 or later). 

SYMPTOM
After the report has finished running, many/most/all of the cells contain the value 0 (zero).


CAUSE
There are many potential causes for why cells in reports return the value 0 (zero). 

 * TIP: See separate IBM Technote #1612145 for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is a deliberate code change (from Controller 10.1.2163 onwards). 

More Details: 
There has been a deliberate change in the security for 'import data' and 'export from excel' (fExpVal).  * Specifically, the user must have 'write' access (not just read access) to the accounts.

ENVIRONMENT
This Technote only relates to Controller 10.1.2163 or later.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Problem will only affect some (restricted) users. If the same report is run by an unrestricted (superuser) account, then all the figures appear OK.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Correct the permissions for the end users. 

 

Specifically, either: 

1. Remove the relevant 'form security group' from the 'bad' users 

or 2. Modify the security permissions (on the form) for the relevant accounts/users 

 

Workaround: 

Either: 

 * Run the report using an administrative (unrestricted) user account (e.g. ADM) 
 * Contact IBM Support for details of a server preference that can be used (to change Controller to revert to the previous method of working).
