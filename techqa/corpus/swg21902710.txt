Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Addresses multiple vulnerabilities disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Runtime Environment Java Technology Edition, Version 6 that is used by Tivoli Composite Application Manager for SOA. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015. 
This bulletin also addresses FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" SSL/TLS vulnerability and RC4 Bar Mitzvah Attack for SSL/TLS vulnerability. These fixes were also previously included in 7.2.0.1-TIV-ITCAMSOA-IF0003.

CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204] was fixed in IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition under CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]. Both CVEs are included in this advisory for completeness. 

CVEID:CVE-2015-0488 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0488]
DESCRIPTION:An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID:CVE-2015-0478 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0478]
DESCRIPTION:An unspecified vulnerability related to the JCE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION:A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION:The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]
DESCRIPTION:Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995]for the current score
