APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using ITCAM for Tx V7.3 (beta2) RRT T6 agent on Windows 2003
   64bit R2, environment, RPT SAP GUI script playback always fails
   with TEP "robotic script playback status" workspace showing
   "last run status" = failed, without any detailed explanation
   why.
   Moreover, the BWM/logs/trace-robotic.log default tracing simply
   states :
   - Checking for SAP registry key existance
   - return value = sapClientPresent=|false|
   - SAP Client not present on box or a reboot was not done after
   it was installed
   - Robotic script playback service init() failed
   -  Could not playback profile RPT SAP playbacks, robotic script
   <script name>.zip. Failed to find the SAP
   client on the system
   - Unknown index value: 1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None, I think the default tracing should be more explicit and
   describe where in the Windows registry (or where exactly on the
   system) the T6 is checking the presence of SAP GUI client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   problem fixed in 7.2 fixpack 3 .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  logs updated to reflect better status messages.
