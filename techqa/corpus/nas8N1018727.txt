General Information
- How is PM for System i5 data transmitted?
PM data is transmitted utilizing Electronic Service Agent (ESA).

- What can I check if a system is no longer sending PM data for IBM i?
Check ESA is working and the reconfigure PM agent: SMP. MustGather : Electronic Customer Support (ECS), Electronic Service Agent (ESA) and Performance Management (PM Agent) 

- How do I tell if a system is sending PM for System i data? 
DCF, Checking for the Last PM iSeries Transmission (V5R1M0 and V5R2M0): Database 'DCF Technotes (IBM i)', View 'Products', Document 'Checking for the Last PM iSeries Transmission (V5R1M0 and Above)' [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/icons/doclink.gif] [</font></b>http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019436]

- Why are my PM for System i5 reports not being generated?
From the Redbooks: A Systems Management Guide to Performance Management for System i and System p servers (SG-247122-3) [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/SG247122/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm]

4.1.5 Accessing the reports through the Web
All customer accounts who transmit their PM for System i performance data to IBM can obtain access to their Management Summary Graph through the World Wide Web. In addition, those who have the Full Service PM for System i offering or other Services contracts can view and print their entire set of PM for System i reports using the same method. In either case, the process is the same.

To ensure that you gain access, verify that the following requirements are met:

1. The status option under the PM for System i menu (GO PM400 in V6R1, GO PMAGT in V7R1 and above) indicates that the data collection process of PM for System i is running.
2. The data is transmitted regularly to IBM, at least weekly. We recommend to transmit daily to reduce the load of data.
3. There are 15 days worth of data transmitted for the previous month and at least one day’s data for the current month. The minimum number of days is 15.
4. You have a user ID and password. After your first successful transmission, you receive an e-mail and letter in the mail from IBM, containing your password and your system serial number.

- To access the reports, go to the Performance Management for Power Systems web site:
https://pmeserver.rochester.ibm.com/PMServerInfo/loginPage.jsp [https://pmeserver.rochester.ibm.com/PMServerInfo/loginPage.jsp]

You must be able to log on. See 3.1, “Background” on page 22, for guidance.

Note: The trend reports need at least three months of consecutive data for them to be meaningful.
