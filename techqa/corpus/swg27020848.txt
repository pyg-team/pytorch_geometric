Text:
client channel; ccdt; channel table WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this techdoc is to show an example of how to define and use a Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT) in WebSphere MQ V7 (or later version) for a Queue Manager Group. 

CONTENT
There are 7 scenarios described in this techdoc:


 1. Simplest case, using same QMNAME for a single queue manager (QM3 in host1) 
 2. Simplest case, using same QMNAME for a single queue manager (QM3 in another host: host2) 
 3. Queue Manager Group: QM1 (no leading asterisk) 
 4. Queue Manager Group: *QM1 (with leading asterisk) 
 5. Queue Manager Group: ' ' (1 blank character) 
 6. Queue Manager Group: QMGROUP1 
 7. Multi-Instance Queue Manager
    


The chapters in this techdoc are: 

Chapter 1: Introduction to Queue Manager Groups 
Chapter 2: Hierarchy of precedence for the connection methods 
- Ensuring that the CCDT will be chosen at runtime 
Chapter 3: Configuration of the queue managers 
Chapter 4: Description of the Scenarios 
Chapter 5: Troubleshooting

Webcast: Using a Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT) in WebSphere MQ V7 for Queue Manager Groups [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024109] 
The objective of this webcast is to describe in details how to exploit from a client application that is using the MQ interface in C or the WebSphere MQ Classes for JMS V7 the connection to multiple queue managers by using an MQ "Client Channel Definition Table" (CCDT).
