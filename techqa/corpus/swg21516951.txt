Title: IBM CWZXT0116E: The {http://Library/xxx} xxx interface has operation with fault. Only interfaces without faults are supported in IBM Process Designer. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This error message points to a limitation documented in the Information center for BPM 7.5
that interface operation with faults is NOT supported ( "Limitations for the definition of an Advanced Integration Service in IBM Process Designer and its implementation in IBM Integration Designer" ). 

SYMPTOM
BPM 7.5 provides the capability of using Process Applications from Process Designer (PD) in the workspace of Integration Designer (ID), called collaborative development. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=1]

In this case, all existing artifacts from the Process Application are stored in a common library (<Process_Application_Name>library). 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&amp;aid=2]

For this library, Library MIRRORING is enabled to make it available to PD as well as ID. Because this is a Process Application library, you CANNOT change the mirroring settings for it 
(right-click the library and from the menu select Properties >> Business Integration >> Library Mirroring).

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=3]

To enable the integration of PD modules (BPM 7.5) with SCA modules (IID 7.5) create new artifacts like an SCA import in the workspace. You can use the existing library containing artifacts from PD, but if you create an interface with fault message in its operation you may get an error like that:

CWZXT0116E: The{http://Test1_Library/SCA_IF} SCA_IF interface has operation with fault.
Only interfaces without fault is supported in BPM Process Designer.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=4]

The reason for this is that PD cannot deal with interfaces (wsdl) with faults.
The use of operations with faults IS supported in ID.

To avoid unpredictable results at runtime, with BPM 7.5.0.1 all interfaces with faults will be flagged as “not supported in PD” as they do reside in a mirrored library. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To avoid this validation problem you should place all artifacts only supported by ID in a new (non-mirrored) library. After the process application was opened in ID workspace you can create a new library (New >> Other >> Library). For this new library, Library Mirroring is NOT enabled by default. Artifacts stored here will NOT be available in PD !

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516951&aid=5]

Creating an interface with faults in a non-mirrored library does NOT show an error message.
