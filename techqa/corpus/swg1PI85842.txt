APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Severe Error x'0504' during install of  *
   *                      Liberty and CICS bundles.               *
   ****************************************************************
   JVMSERVER installs and is set to enabled, the Liberty server is
   still starting up.  CRLR resolution transaction executes to
   notify the enabled JVMSERVER about installed BUNDLES and is
   suspended due to other work in the System.  The Liberty server
   fails to startup correctly and so the JVMSERVER moves to a
   disabling state.  The JVMSERVER is disabled removing all the TP
   and T8 TCBs.
   
   Additional Keywords: x0504
   
   CRLR resumes and attempts to enable the bundle within the
   JVMSERVER, this causes a change_mode to occur during the
   processing and leads to the severe error x'0504' error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSJTH has been changed to detect a JVMSERVER state change
   and not allocate a thread.
