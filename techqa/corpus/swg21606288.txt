Title: IBM How to reduce WebSphere Transformation Extender Command Server execution time. - United States

Text:
Command Server performance TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are there any WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender (WTX) Command Server command line options to increase performance? 

CAUSE
Execution WebSphere Transformation Extender maps with the Command Server can result in increased execution times on long running maps if the refresh status feature is not disabled. The process to refresh the screen takes away resources from the overall map execution.

ANSWER
Use the -Rx option with the Command Server to reduce the frequency of updates to the screen where x is the number of times to refresh the screen per second.

The default is 2 per seconds. A value of 0 disables all screen updates related to map execution. Valid values are 0 through 99.

As an example, if you are executing a map named, mymap.mmc, and you want to disable the Command Server screen refresh, type: 

dtxcmdsv mymap.mmc -R0 


This option is available with maps run in UNIX and Windows environments only.
