APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Content Navigator, when using Microsoft Internet
   Explorer (IE) and Google Chrome, the date picker does not
   display the calendar pop up window when clicking on the icon.
   However, clicking the text field next to the icon will bring up
   the calendar pop up window. Clicking the icon and the text
   field will display the pop up calendar window when using
   Mozilla Firefox.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Click the text field in IE and Chrome or use Firefox.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, the
   date picker does not display the calendar pop up window when
   clicking on the icon. However, clicking the text field next to
   the icon will bring up the calendar pop up window.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this fix (in ICN V2.0.3.8 LA016, V3.0.2 LA003, and V3.0.3
   LA001), clicking both the icon and the text field will display
   the calendar pop window in these browsers.
