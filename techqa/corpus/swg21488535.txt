Title: IBM Can SPSS GENLIN fit a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial regression model? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Generalized Linear Model procedure (GENLIN command) in SPSS/PASW statistics allows me to fit a model for a response variable with a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution. However I would like to use the Zero-Inflated Poisson or Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial distribution. Is this distribution available in SPSS/PASW Statistics? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS does not currently offer regression models for dependent variables with zero-inflated distributions, including Poisson or negative binomial. However, there is an extension command available as part of the R Programmability Plug-in which will estimate zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial models. 

This procedure, STATS ZEROINFL, estimates mixture models consisting of a Poisson or negative binomial count model and a point mass at zero. The predictors can be different for the two models. 
The estimated model can be saved and used for predictions on new data. 

STATS ZEROINFL requires SPSS Statistics version 18 or above and the R Programmability plug-in and uses the R package pscl

The R Programmability Plug-in installation and install instructions can be accessed from the 
R Essentials section of the Downloads for IBM SPSS Statistics [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/We70df3195ec8_4f95_9773_42e448fa9029/page/Downloads%20for%20IBM%C2%AE%20SPSS%C2%AE%20Statistics] site. 

There is also a link to the Extension commands at this site, in the area titled "Extensions, Tools, 
and Utilities". The downloads for the extension can be downloaded from the the linked page and then
installed from the SPSS menu Utilities->Extension Bundles->Install Local Extension Bundle. 
In SPSS Statistics 22 and later versions, the extension bundle can be installed from the SPSS Statistics menu 
Utilities->Extension Bundles->Download and Install Extension Bundle 
without having to personally download the Extension Bundle from the above site as an intermediate step. Be sure to run SPSS Statistics as Administrator in the session where extension bundles are installed. 

Once the STATS ZEROINFL extension bundle has been installed, it will be available from the menu system at 
Analyze->Generalized Linear Models->Zero-Inflated Count Models
