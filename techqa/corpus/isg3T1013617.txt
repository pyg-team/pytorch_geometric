PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Where can I find more information on the decay computation for fairshare? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Where can I find more information on the decay computation for fairshare?Here is the default dynamic priority formula:

dynamic priority = number_shares / (cpu_time * CPU_TIME_FACTOR + run_time *RUN_TIME_FACTOR + (1 + job_slots) * RUN_JOB_FACTOR

In the above formula the cpu_time is calculated using HIST_HOURS.

cpu_time: The cumulative CPU time used by the user (measured in hours).LSF calculates the cumulative CPU time using the actual (not normalized) CPU time and a decay factor such that 1 hour of recently-used CPU time decays to 0.1 hours after an interval of time specified by HIST_HOURS in lsb.params (5 hours by default).

For example based on your HIST_HOURS configuration, after 42 hours, 1hour of cpu time will be decayed to 0.1 hours.
