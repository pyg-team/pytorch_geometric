PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All OMEGAMON XE for CICS on z/OS users.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recursive abend S0C1 during OMEGAMON    *
   *                      initialization in CICS.                 *
   *                                                              *
   *                      After OA45903 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1OA45903] an abend S130 may occur   *
   *                      when creating a sample Global, for      *
   *                      example with KCIJPLOD.                  *
   *                                                              *
   *                      An OC1003 message may be issued during  *
   *                      OMEGAMON initialization in CICS.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The OMEGAMON recovery routine attempted a retry with
   incorrect registers which caused an abend S0C1; that caused
   the recovery routine to be recursively invoked.
   
   The ENQ for accessing OMEGAMON global member may
   unintentionally use a different RNAME than the DEQ.
   
   OMEGAMON initialization uses a small amount of
   below-the-line memory; in the unusual event of that not
   being obtained, some initialization options may cause an
   invalid reference to that memory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The OMEGAMON recovery routine was corrected.
   
   Both the ENQ and DEQ now use the same RNAME.
   
   OMEGAMON was corrected to not make invalid references to that
   memory.
