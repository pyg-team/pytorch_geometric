APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Test Suite can't be run in  IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM)
   when "Modify the execution Variable values" option is selected.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. From Manage Project Properties-> Project Execution variables,
   create two Project variables with values.
   2. Create a new Test Suite  with a Test Case.
   3. Create two new artifact Execution Variables for Test Suite
   and assign values to them.
   4. Add the two Project variables created on step 1 to the Test
   Suite.
   5. Run the Test Suite and select "Modify Execution variable
   values" option.
   6. Click on the Next button.
   
   Expected Results:
   The artifact variable names are displayed correctly and "Finish'
   button is enabled.
   
   Actual Results:
   The artifact variable names are not displayed and "Finish'
   button is disabled.
