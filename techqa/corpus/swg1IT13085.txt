APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Sustained CPU spike, of the noapp process.  CPU spikes 30-40%
   higher than noted in previous builds in some cases.
   
   On Linux platforms this is captured with the "top" command.
   
   Using "top -H" (show threads) the offending thread within the
   noapp JVM was found to be a perimeter dispatcher thread.

   This has been attributed to a parameter introduced into
   perimeter.properties:
   
   perimeter.niodispatcher=true
   
   Toggling this parameter to false drops the CPU back to normal
   levels.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 487243
   RW/RW
   Circumvention:
   Add the following to customer_overrides.properties:
   perimeter.perimeter.niodispatcher=false
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected:
   All
   
   Problem Description:
   High CPU usage caused by Perimeter Dispatcher Thread
   property after upgrading to 5.2.6.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution Summary:
   A code fix has been provided. For more information on changing
   the perimeter.niodispatcher.properties file to improve system
   performance in Glocal Mailbox, see Performace Overview in the
   Performace and tuning for Global Mailbox (V5.2.6 or later)
   documentation.
