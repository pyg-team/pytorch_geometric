 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in products bundled with IBM Security Directory Suite 8.0 and 8.0.1 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0718
DESCRIPTION: Expat is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking when processing malformed XML data. By using the Expat library, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the victim or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113408 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113408] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: CVE-2016-2834
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: CVE-2016-5285
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in PK11_SignWithSymKey / ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime when handling invalid Diffie-Hellman keys. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash a TLS/SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2016-6313
DESCRIPTION: GnuPG could provide weaker than expected security, caused by an error in the mixing functions when obtaining 4640 bits from the random number generator. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to predict the next 160 bits of output.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116169 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116169] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2016-8635
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a small subgroup confinement attack in Diffie Hellman Client key exchange handling. By confining the client DH key to small subgroup of the desired group, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover private keys.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
