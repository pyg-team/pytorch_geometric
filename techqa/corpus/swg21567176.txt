PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are running CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 along with ASSIST/TS and receive error message DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task TCP in control. 

SYMPTOM
DFHSR0601 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsr/SR0601.html] Program interrupt occurred with system task TCP in control


CAUSE
Vendor product manipulating the TCTTE control block

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A review of a dump taken for the DFHSR0601 error message will show an ABEND0C4 occurred at offset x'1A4' in module DFHZACT. The failing instruction is:

5021 0198 ST R2,TCTEHACP-DFHTCTTE(R1)

R1 (register 1) should contain an address of a terminal control table entry or TCTTE, but instead contains an incorrect address of DFFFFFFF. When you look at the terminal control table prefix or TCTFX, you will also find this same value at offset x'110' and x'114' for the fields TCTVAA1 and TCTVAA2. These fields should contain a full word of FFFFFFFF to indicate there are no terminals to be processed on the activate scan chain. The log also shows that a terminal just had an error causing message DFHZC2455 to be issued. Examining this terminal's TCTTE control block, you will also see this same DFFFFFFF value at offset x'198'
