APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The way the backout count works is via the optional JMS
   property of
   JMSXDeliveryCount. If the JMS provider does not support this
   then the
   message will be backed out after the first attempt anyway.
    Based on my current tests, MQ JMS support this but the
   threashold
   always has a value of 0 and hence the reason why it backed out
   after the first retry.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The backout threshold on the JMS        *
   *                      Input node has no effect.               *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The JMS Input node has a backout threshold which specifies
   the number of times a message is sent through the flow
   before it is backed out to a backout queue.
   The value will not be stored correctly and the node will only
   make one attempt to try the message before backing it
   out.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to store the value correctly. After
   applying the fix, the flow must be redeployed for the
   correct threshold value to be picked up by the flow.
