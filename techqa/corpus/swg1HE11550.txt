APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the server name for a Domino server is provided in host name
   format instead of the Lotus Notes abbreviated format, it cannot
   be found in the Domino address book. As a result, the IBM
   Content Collector Email Connector might fail. The same problem
   occurs if there is no entry for the server in the Domino address
   book.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Provide the Domino server name in Lotus Notes abbreviated
   format, not as host name, and ensure that there is an entry for
   the server in the Domino address book.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a Lotus Domino server is defined as collection source in a
   task route and the server name is provided in host name format
   instead of the Domino name, the IBM Content Collector Email
   Connector might fail. This problem occurs whenever a Notes
   document cannot be archived and is added to the IBM Content
   Collector blacklist.
   
   When a document is added to the blacklist, IBM Content Collector
   generates a URL link to the problematic document. To do so,
   Content Collector searches the Domino Directory for the
   corresponding Domino server document and resolves the server
   name to its host name. If the server name was already defined in
   host name format, the server document cannot be found, which
   causes the IBM Content Collector Email Connector service to stop
   unexpectedly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 IF005, the address
   book handling was improved so that this problem does not occur
   anymore.
