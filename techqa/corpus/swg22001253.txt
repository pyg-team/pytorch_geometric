QUESTION
 Before raising a service request for Intelligent Video Analytics (IVA), what diagnostic data should I collect?

Collecting data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBM Support quickly determine if:
1. Symptoms match known problems.
2. The problem is not a defect and can be identified and resolved quickly.
3. A workaround exists to reduce the problem severity. 

ANSWER
Thoroughly describe the problem. Include any relevant system history, troubleshooting steps taken, and whether the issue is consistent or intermittent. Also include any screenshots that will help illustrate the issue. 

The Video Management System (VMS) integrated with IVA, including release. 

 

From the Smart Surveillance Engine (SSE) Server, upload the contents of: 

\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SSE\* 

 

From the Middleware for Large Scale Surveillance (MILS) Server, upload the contents of: 

IVA V1.6.x 

 \IBM\SVS\HTTPServer\logs\* 

\IBM\SVS\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\logs\server1\* 

 

IVA V2.0 

 \IBM\HTTPServer\logs\* 

\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\logs\server1\* 

 

If the problem is related to a problem with analytics for a particular video, upload the video file that we can use to reproduce the issue.
