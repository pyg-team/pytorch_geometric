Title: IBM Error reading SAS files with Statistics 18 when Unicode is turned off - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Warning # 7254. Command name: GET SAS 
One or more string data values contained invalid characters. Any invalid 
characters were replaced by question marks. If the source file originated in 
a different locale and if you are running in Unicode mode, you can specify an 
encoding with the ENCODING subcommand.

Scenario 1
I'm running Statistics 18 or 19 on my computer, and it is not correctly reading sas files (get sas) containing strings when Unicode is off. 
The strings are being truncated by one character. In this case they're the identifier by which the file is being matched.
Works correctly if Unicode is on, but this causes me many more problems with string field width inflation on existing files.

Scenario 2
When opening a file the message "command name: get sas, one or more string data values contains invalid characters..."
The problem does not on appear in version 17.0.3
warning reports state that invalid characters replaced by "?" but I can not see the question marks in the dataset.
Reading SAS 9.1 files. saved as sas7bdat format. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and addressed in IBM SPSS Statistics 19 Fix Pack 2. 


As a workaround please check the Character encoding for data and syntax in:
Edit>Options
The default is usually "Locale's writing System", please change it to Unicode and test importing your SAS dataset.

Normally there should not be any changes to the data for analytical purposes, but we suggest you verify the results.
