APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description of Problem (full details):
   
   After upgrading P8-eForms to 4.0.1-005, the Save and Close
   buttons appear in eForm tab in BPF instead of being hidden
   (since the BPF Save and Close buttons should be used instead in
   this scenario).
   
   It is confirmed by the eForm L3 team that:
   
   1. When creating a form policy, if you don't click on the
   "Advanced" button in "Define Step Map" section, then you get the
   XML with no toolbar node.
   2. When creating a form policy, if you click on the "Advanced"
   button in the "Define Step Map" section you get the XML with
   toolbar node.
   
   BPF needs to read the form policy file when trying to display
   the case. It is likely that, after upgrading eForms, the
   customer clicked on the "Advanced" button when editing the form
   policy, and as a result, the eForms Save and Close buttons now
   show up in the eForm tab in the BPF.
