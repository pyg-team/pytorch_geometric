PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a business object resolution problem with WebSphere Process Server. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the WebSphere Process Server Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collect troubleshooting data for problems with WebSphere Process Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time.



Setting the trace setting 
Set the following trace string, then reproduce the problem. For instructions, see the main WebSphere Process Server MustGather document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239895#instructions]. 


*=info: 
SCA.*=all: 
ArtifactLoader=all: 
BOCore=all: BOFactory=all: 
BOXMLSerializer=all: BOXMLDocument=all: BOTypeMetaData=all: 


Note: Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction time-outs and errors. 

Required diagnostic information 

Gather the following information and files: 

General diagnostic information  * Problem description 
 * Environment description 
 * Server logs: All files from
   <profile_root>/<profile_name>/logs/<server_name>
   <profile_root>/<profile_name>/logs/ffdc 
 * Project interchange (PI) or enterprise archive (EAR) file from the relevant applications




Automated Collection of Troubleshooting Data 
Automated data collectors are available in IBM Support Assistant to improve the accuracy of complete data collection. You can use ISA Lite to automate the gathering of the required log files. 

Note: When you use ISA Lite, also gather a detailed problem description, environment description, and other requested materials, such as a PI file.
