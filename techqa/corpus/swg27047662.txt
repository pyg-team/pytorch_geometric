Title: IBM Cannot Export BMP Images - United States

Text:
LCMS Premier Static HTML Export SCORM mime type Bitmap bmp image PRODUCT README

ABSTRACT
 This note describes how to configure IBM Premier LCMS to export BMP images.


CONTENT
Symptom : 

When exporting to SCORM or Static HTML BMP Images used in content will not export and display a place holder when viewed. 

Cause : 
Use of BMP images in elearning is not considered a best practice. Mime type support for BMP Images is therefore not enabled by default

Environment : 
IBM Premier LCMS

Diagnosing The Problem : 
You are facing this specific issue if : 
- The exported content does not contain BMP images that are contained in the original content
- The export displays 'complete' in the Process Monitor
- The process monitor log file (click on 'completed' link in Process Monitor) contains this error message :
Error replacing reference
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'mimeType' cannot be null or
consist of whitespace characters only.

Resolving The Problem : 
The BMP file mime type needs to be added. 
(Note : this configuration requires Server Access and will therefore have to be requested via our Managed Services Team in case Your LCMS is hosted by IBM)
in [installation_directory]\appweb\evsfiles\properties\mediaconfig.xml

-> ensure that the string
<extension>bmp</extension> in the <mediaPlayers> section

in [installation_directory]/appcfg/configfiles/mime.properties :
add this line
bmp=image/bmp

After this services will need to be restarted and content to be re-exported.
