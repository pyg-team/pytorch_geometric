QUESTION
 How do I transfer my IBM SPSS product/software license from one machine to another? 

ANSWER
It is not possible, nor required, to transfer a license from an existing product installation to a new product installation in order to use the product on a new host machine/computer. 
Due to the nature of the IBM SPSS software licensing technology, a license created for use on one product host machine/computer can not be used on a different host machine/computer. 

Unless otherwise specified in your IBM software licensing agreement, the following is the case:


 * A valid Authorized User product authorization code can be used to license up to two (2) product installations used by the same individual. 
 * A valid Site license allows for more than one user to license product installations using the same authorization code. 
 * Compliance with your IBM software licensing agreement does not require a transfer of a license from one host machine/computer to a different one. 
 * Compliance with your IBM software licensing agreement does not require the previously installed IBM SPSS product to be uninstalled in order to install and license the same product on a new host machine/computer. 
 * Compliance with your IBM software licensing agreement does not require the removal of the license of the previously installed product. 
 * Compliance with your IBM software licensing agreement does not require the return of previously issued licenses.


Note: Copying/pasting the installed software folders/files from one host machine/computer to another will not result in a working version of the product. 

If you wish to install and license an IBM SPSS product on a new computer, you need only: 

1. Install the software on the new host machine/computer.  * If you downloaded your software from IBM.com, you can move the .zip file from the old machine to the new. Please make sure to extract the files from the .zip file before beginning the install.
   
 * If you need to download the software, a number of tutorial videos are available here [http://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/PassportAdvantageOnlinevideos.html]. 

2. License the software on the new host machine/computer. 
 * If you have authorization code for the product, you may use this authorization code. 
 * If you are using a pre-existing authorization code and receive a 'You are not allowed to generate any more new licenses' message, instructions for resolving this issue can be found here. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21480566] 
 * If you do not have an authorization code for the product, instructions for creating an authorization code can be found here. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980065] 
 * If you have more than one authorization code available to you, instructions for confirming the authorization code can be found make sure you are here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21486143].
