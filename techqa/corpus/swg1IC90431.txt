APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A security vulnerability was discovered in SSL and TLS
   protocols when CBC ciphers are used (such as 3DES and AES in CBC
   mode).  Small differences in the time taken during MAC
   processing can leak enough information to allow  a
   man-in-the-middle attacker to recover plaintext information from
   previous SSL/TLS connections.
   
   This vulnerability is known as CVE-2013-0169 and also as "Lucky
   13".
   
   The DataPower appliance's SSL implementation is vulnerable to
   this attack when CBC cipher suites are used (but not when stream
   cipher suites are used).
   
   
   The protocol problem that allows the attack only affects block
   ciphers such as 3DES and AES.  There is one stream cipher
   supported by SSL/TLS called RC4.  Using a stream cipher avoids
   this attack entirely.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a stream cipher (RC4) to alleviate this vulnerability until
   the APAR fix is available.
   
   
   
   To configure this in the DataPower WebGUI, enter the string
   RC4-SHA:RC4-MD5 into the Ciphers property in the Crypto Profile
   and Save. With this configuration setting, DataPower
   negotiates strong, non-export cipher suites involving RC4 - a
   stream cipher rather than a block cipher.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customers using the DataPower SSL stack with CBC cipher suites
   (3DES or AES) are vulnerable to the "Lucky 13" attack
   (CVE-2013-0169).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 4.0.1.17, 4.0.2.13, and 5.0.0.8.
