QUESTION
 IBM Content Collector (ICC) can process document version series in Microsoft SharePoint (SP). How do I migrate also the comments in version history for each version? 

CAUSE
In the SharePoint collector of ICC task route, "Comments" is selected under Column Mapping. But the comments field in the version history still does not get migrated.

ANSWER
Migrating comments in version history is supported starting in ICC 4.0 Fixpack 2 (4.0.0.2). 
Ensure you are at 4.0 Fixpack 2 or higher. Alternatively, you can also use ICC 4.0.1. 

Start configuring your task route using one of the following two templates: 

 * SP to CM - With Versions 
 * SP to P8 - With Versions


Configure the SharePoint collector to migrate comments:  * In the SharePoint collector task, go to Collection Sources tab. 
 * Select your collection source and click the pencil icon to Edit Collection Source ... 
 * Select the Column Mapping tab 
 * Under Column, select "Check In Comment."


Note, in earlier versions before ICC 4.0.0.2, you will not see "Check In Comment" in the available columns. You may only see "Comments" and selecting that for column mapping does not actually migrate the comments in version history.
