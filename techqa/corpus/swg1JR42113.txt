   ****************************************************************
   During performance analysis of the high degree of chattiness
   between the Process Designer and Process Center on BPM 7.5.1,
   we found that extra network trips are made.
   Changes were done to remove 2 server trips per EJB call. For
   networks with high latency, this makes a big difference.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The extra network trips were removed and performance improved.
   
   The fix is available as a part of the JR42012 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42012] ifix package
   (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42012)
   and needs to be installed as follows:
   - Install JR42012 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42012] on both Process Designer and Process
   Center/Server using IM
   - On Process Center/Server run bpmprofileUpgrade as outlined in
