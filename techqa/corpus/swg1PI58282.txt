APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a stream that exports to a share at <export path>. When I
   run the stream in Modeler, it works.
   When I run the same stream in Modeler through a job step, I get
   'Success'- it works too, but the log shows:
   
   Cannot find artifact <default path>/<export path>
   
   which is correct - that path does not exist (it is at <export
   path>)
