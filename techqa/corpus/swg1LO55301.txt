APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Create a directory assistance database
   Add 2 entries, each:
       type: Notes
      Group Authorization: Yes
   
   You get the error message:
       The document with the Domain Name "whatever" already has
   Group
   Authorization enabled, only one such document is allowed in this
   database.
   
   Customers can use the Extended Directory Catalog in here to work
   around the
   issue. Since the workaround creates searches a list the size of
   the 2 address
   books added together, then there is little benefit in
   restricting this.
   
   It seems to make better sense to change the "Error" changed to a
   warning or a
   "tooltip"  for the "Group Authorization" field if the concern is
   only
   performance-related.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Extended directory catalog to aggregate these into 1 EDC.nsf
   which goes into DA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A programming error was found but will not be corrected. It
    will be a permanent restriction.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A programming error was found but will not be corrected. It
    will be a permanent restriction.
