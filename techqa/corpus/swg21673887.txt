RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error can happen if you deleted the target installation directory and removed the Deployment Engine (DE) related files, but the DE related files were not completely removed.

 
Please follow steps in below technote to remove DE and the target installation dir. Also, please make sure you have enough free disk space in /tmp and the target installation directory. 
CAUTION: Removing DE related files as described in below technote will completely remove the DE repository. This procedure should only be used if you are installing a base product from scratch and there is no other product installed (under same user id) which shares this DE repository. If you are not sure then do not perform these steps.
