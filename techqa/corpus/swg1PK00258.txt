   This PTF will add National Language Support for CICS Batch
   Application Control.
   The support at this time is for Japanese only, and provides
   messages and the workstation GUI in US English and Japanese.
   During testing, an ABEND0C1 occured in CBKTCPSV when a dump was
   requested by the CICS BAC workstation client, this problem is
   also resolved in this APAR.

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR provides support for US English and Japanese for
   messages and the workstation client GUI. It is VERY important
   that the ++HOLD for ACTion items listed within this PTFare
   carefully checked, as CBKSETUP, the previous downloadable GUI
   for CICS BAC will no longer work, and the user must choose
   either the Japanese or US English version to install.
   This PTF also resolves an ABENDS0C1 in CBKTCPSV.
