.NET server issues 

Problem:


Installation of agent on .NET server failed


Solution:


If the installation fails for any reason, the final dialog will provide a link to the installation log for use in troubleshooting. It may be worth attempting to install on a different or new site on the server, even a different site that was labeled "not recommended". In all cases you must uninstall before attempting installation again. The location of the two installation logs is the %temp% folder. The names of the two installation logs are: 
glassbox_setup_api.txt
glassbox_setup_msi.txt 








Java server issues 
Important: JRE 8 is not supported, so ensure you are using JRE 6 or 7.



Problem:


Automatic installation of agent on a JBoss server failed


Solution:


There is sometimes a problem when using the automatic installer on a JBoss server, but following the instructions for manual installation should be successful in these cases:
Install manually on a JBoss or JBoss Service server [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPH29_9.0.0/com.ibm.help.common.infocenter.aps/t_GlassBoxAgentInstall_JBoss.html?lang=en]



Problem:
Installation of agent on Java server failed


Solution:


The log name is: IBM_Security_AppScan_Glass_Box_Agent_Java_Install_[month]_[day]_[year]_[hr]_[min]_[sec].log


 * If the installation ends successfully or reached the final stage, the log is saved to the "<installdir>/Logs" folder.
   
 * If the installation failed before that, or was aborted by the user, the log is saved to:  * Windows: Desktop 
    * Linux: "/root" folder
      
      
   
   

Problem: 
When following the user guide instructions for installing manually on a Tomcat server, I am unable to log in to Tomcat Manager in order to deploy GBootStrap web application.


Possible solution:


Try this alternate method: 

 1. Copy the file GBootStrap.war from the glass box folder you extracted 
 2. Paste it into the webapps folder, default location:
    C:\apache-tomcat-[version]\webapps
