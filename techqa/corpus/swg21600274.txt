QUESTION
 Alcatel WMS probe : Why are the Active alarms missing? 

CAUSE
The default settings for the IBM Java ORB are incorrect for this probe

ANSWER
 

The IBM Java ORB requires two property settings to allow the ORB to work normally in most environments. 

 

for the Alcatel WMS probe, set the following properties in the probes property file: 


ORBCharEncoding : "ISO8859_1"
ORBWCharDefault : "UTF16" 

If you are using the probe in a firewall environment, then check that the probe has the ORBLocalHostName and OrbLocalPort properties and set these to suitable values.

It is important that the hostname's used are visible to both servers.
For example, the Alcatel WMS should be able to ping the host as specified in the ORBLocalHostName.

If necessary add the other servers hostname to the servers /etc/host file to ensure name resolution between the servers is identical.
