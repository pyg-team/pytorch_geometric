APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading to BPM 8.5.7, a new User
   ${process.server.securityAdminUser} could be seen in
   ProcessAdmin Console in the groups TWAdmins and TWAuthors.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the CustomURisVMM property is set, the DBUpgrade command
   does not recognize the correct security domain to load the user
   name from for the TWAdmins and TWAuthors groups.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that correctly resolves the user name for the TWAdmins and
   TWAuthors groups in an environment that has security domains and
   a customer user registry that that acts like VMM.
