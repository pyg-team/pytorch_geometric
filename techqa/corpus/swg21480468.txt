Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to generate a license code using the authorization code and the lock code. I get an error 201. How can I fix this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Error 201 can indicate that the record in our License Management database had an unrecognized character. This is no longer an issue but this code may have been created before this issue was addressed. Contact spsscs@us.ibm.com and someone will be able to fix this for you
