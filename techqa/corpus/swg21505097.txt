Title: IBM EJPXA0060W: A user or group with ID {0} could not be retrieved from the portal datastore, possibly because it does not exist. Related {1} configuration data will not be updated. - United States

PROBLEM
XMLAccess -in Input.xml ... 

results in: 

<message id="EJPXA0060W">com.ibm.wps.command.xml.XmlCommandException: EJPXA0060W: A user or group with ID {0} could not be retrieved from the portal datastore, possibly because it does not exist. Related {1} configuration data will not be updated. [{2}{3}]</message> 

{0} is the user or group name - generally a distinguished name (DN). 

{1} is the configuration data that cannot be updated - generally access control or group membership. 

{2} is the resource type this configuration applies to. 

{3} is the resource identifier - generally an object ID.


SYMPTOM
This is a warning. The import will succeed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Depending on your use case, you have several options: 

 

Option 1: Ignore the warning. 

If you are importing a full release (ExportRelease.xml) from a source to a target system and you know that certain users in the source system's repository do not exist in the target system's, then you could ignore the warning. 

For example, if a group named "testusers" exists on a Development environment, but does not exist on a Quality Assurance environment, the warnings are to be expected and may be ignored. 

 

 

Option 2: Clean up the XMLAccess input (Input.xml in the example above). 

If you intend on importing a certain virtual portal release into several virtual portals in your enterprise and you wish to avoid confusion for administrators, then you could remove the references to {0} in resource's {3} configuration data {1} from Input.xml. 

For example, if a group named "testusers" exists on a Development environment, but does not exist on a Quality Assurance environment, remove the references to testusers from the Input.xml file. 

 

 

Option 3: Verify user and repository configuration. 

If you are attempting to explicitly assign access controls to a certain group but WebSphere Portal cannot find the group, you should verify the DN and the repository configuration (VMM in 6.1 and later; WMM in 6.0). 

For example, if a group named "testusers" exists on a Development environment, and should also exist on a Quality Assurance environment, the repository configuration on both environments should be verified to ensure both systems are able to find the "testusers" group successfully independent of the XMLAccess import.
