   Charts and Task List do not load until
   user changes their Language preference in
   the User Profile.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added a configurable flag that will resolve the user's browser
   locale to a Portal-supported locale, and properly set the
   language as their User Preference. If the user's browser locale
   is not a Portal-supported locale, then the user's locale will
   default to English.
