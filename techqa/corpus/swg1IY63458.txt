APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer has correctly specified an SSLPEER value (which
   matched the corresponding certificate) but the channel failed
   to start and gave error message AMQ9636.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  P19896.7440.AIX.P530.07.tar.Z
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   You may see this problem if you have use SSL channels and
   specify an SSLPEER value. Note that this problem will only
   affect some SSLPEER values (see 'problem summary') so if you
   have set up SSL and SSLPEER values and it is working OK then
   you will not see this problem 'develop' at a later stage.
   
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The problem was caused by how WebSphere MQ pattern matched
   within the SSLPEER value. The problem could cause WebSphere MQ
   to incorrectly interpret some DN attribute values as other
   attribute values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The algorithm has been corrected so that WebSphere MQ now
   ensures that it is comparing the correct attributes with one
   another.
