ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A new-line is not displayed when inputting Enter key at the top
   left, so scroll bar is falls.  In correct case, new-line is
   displayed and cursor bar does not move.  Internet explorer 6, 7,
   8 reproduce it.  In Firefox, a new-line is collapses.
   This issue does not reproduce in Domino 8.5.2.  It is a
   regression in Domino 8.5.3.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create new form which has a rich text field using JavaScript
   control for web access.
   2. Internet Explorer opens the form.
   3. Put some characters in the field and press "Shift + Enter"
   key to input new-line.  Or, Notes client creates a document.
   4. Step 3 is repeated until a vertical scroll bar is displayed.
   5. Move your cursor to top left (it is the leftmost cursor point
   on the 1st line. )
   6. Press "Enter" key several times.
   New-line is not displayed.  Scroll bar is falls.
   
   When using Firefox 3.6, in Domino 8.5.2, no problem.  But in
   8.5.3, a new-line collapses. The following picture is Enter key
   is pressed 1 times.
