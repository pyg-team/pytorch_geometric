ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to transfer any workflow or schema changes to the
   Workflow server via the Process Configuration Console, the
   following error message is provided
   
   Exception executing transfer WF RPC: ORB Timeout
   org.omg.CORBA.NO_RESPONSE: Request 70230 timed out vmcid: IBM
   minor code: B01 completed: Maybe org.omg.CORBA.NO_RESPONSE:
   Request 70230 timed out vmcid: IBM minor code: B01 completed:
   Maybe
   
   In looking at the server logs, the transfer completes, but it is
   taking a significant amount of time.  This happens even when a
   small workflow or minor change has been made to the workflow
   database.
   
   The problem will occur if any number of fields are exposed on
   either of the following queues, Inbox, Tracker, or
   DefaultRoster.  The performance delay will increase as more and
   more workitems are introduced into any of the aforementioned
   queues .
