APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 24 or 23 FixPack 3 release.
   You have an Excel file where a numeric variable with decimal
   values is formatted as type 'General' in Excel with left aligned
   cells.
   You can import this Excel *.xlsx file without any problem into
   IBM SPSS Statistics 23 FP2.
   However, in release 24 for example you click on 'File - Import
   Data - Excel' dialog and select your XLSX file.
   You see on Read Excel Data dialog there is no preview of the
   data displayed.
   When you click OK on the dialog the file is not imported.
   Instead you see an error like the below on output viewer:
   
   Error.  Command name: GET DATA
   (2063) Error reading information for sheet.
   * Sheet Name: "<your sheet name>"
   Execution of this command stops.
   EXECUTE.
   
   Error # 105.  Command name: EXECUTE
   This command is not valid before a working file has been
   defined.
   Execution of this command stops.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. As a workaround open
   your file in Excel and format the entire column as NUMBER with 2
   decimal digits and save the xlsx file. Import this file instead
   to SPSS and it will work fine. The issue also only happens when
   you use a non-English regional setting on Control Panel -
   Regional settings.
