PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Navigator Deployment tool may fail when deploying against WAS V9.0 

SYMPTOM
1) Configure the IBM Content Navigator Web Application
2) Build the Web Application
3) Deploy the Web Application

The 3rd step fails with the following error:

WASX7444E: Invalid parameter value "" for parameter "config id" on
command "modify"


CAUSE
This happens due to WAS missing out on adding the JAVA Persistence API Service tag to its server.xml of newly created server(s)

ENVIRONMENT
ICN V2.0.3, ICN V3.0.1, WAS V9.0

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check for error WASX7444E: Invalid parameter value "" for parameter "config id" on
command "modify" during deployment of ICN ear file using ICN CMUI.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
From WAS admin console perform the following:





 * Application Servers -><server name> 
 * Under Container Settings, Click Container Services 
 * Go to Default Java Persistence API settings and just click Apply and then click Save without making any changes here. 
   This will update the server.xml with JAVA Persistence API settings which are missing in a newly created application server's sever.xml in WAS V9.0.
   
 * Run the deploy task to deploy your new ICN ear file.
