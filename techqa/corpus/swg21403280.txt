 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides troubleshooting methods for when you see an AMQ9271 message in the system error log when using WebSphere MQ V7.0, V7.0.0.1 or V7.0.0.2, or when an FFST of probe KN432051 is generated using WebSphere MQ V7.0.1, V7.1 or V7.5 on the HP-UX or HP Itanium systems. 

SYMPTOM
When using client channels with WebSphere MQ V7.0, V7.0.0.1 or V7.0.0.2 the following error message is found in the system error log: 

AMQ9271: Channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' timed out.

EXPLANATION:
A timeout occurred while waiting to receive from the other end of channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN'. The address of the remote end of the connection was '127.0.0.1(1414)'.

ACTION:
The return code from the select() [TIMEOUT] 60 seconds call was 0 (X'0').Record these values and tell the systems administrator.

A tight loop occurs in the amqzmur0 process that may cause it to use a greater than normal percentage of the available CPU.

When using client channels with WebSphere MQ V7.0.1, V7.1 or V7.5 the following FFST is generated:

CAUSE
A problem in the operating system cumulative ARPA transport patch causes WebSphere MQ to receive an unexpected error condition on a listening socket.


ENVIRONMENT
This problem has been known to occur with the PHNE_36281 cumulative ARPA transport patch on HP operating systems.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install a more recent level of the cumulative ARPA transport patch. The PHNE_39203 patch is known to resolve the problem.
