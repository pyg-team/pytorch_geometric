PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing the AppScan Source Developer Plugin For Eclipse/RAD, the value of the Ant Runtime Classpath is changed. 

CAUSE
The installation of the AppScan Source developer plugin caused the value of the ANT_HOME variable to be changed, resulting in a modified Ant Runtime Classpath.

ENVIRONMENT
This problem has only been seen with RAD 7.5.x and Eclipse 3.4.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, set the ANT_HOME variable back to it's original value. To do so:




 1. In Eclipse/RAD, go to Window -> Preferences. 
 2. Go to Ant -> Runtime. 
 3. Click the Ant Home button. 
 4. Browse to the correct ANT_HOME (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SDP70Shared\plugins\org.apache.ant_1.7.0.v200803061910). 
 5. Click Apply and then click OK.
