APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While you migrate from IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)
   V7.5.1.2 to IBM BPM V8.5.7, you might use a feature in the
   V7.5.1.2 saved search definition to change the column name
   for business data (which is exposed for the search). This
   feature was available only in V7.5.1.2. Since IBM BPM
   V8.x, the column name has based on the alias definition
   for the business variable. Nevertheless, the customized
   column name (as it is saved within a product XML file)
   works in the runtime environment of IBM Process Portal and
   it is shown on the Heritage Process Portal. However, the
   customized column name is not displayed on the Process
   Portal in IBM BPM V8.5.7.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7.0 cumulative fix
   2016.09 that uses the REST API that Heritage Process Portal used
   to get the missing data for Process Portal, shows the aliases
   defined in V7.5.1.2, and keeps the current behavior for saved
   search created on recent IBM BPM versions.
   
   With this fix applied, the aliases that you created for business
   data column on saved searches are displayed; however, you cannot
   create new saved searches with aliases for business data
   columns. Plus, if you modify a saved search with aliases for
   business data columns, those aliases are overwritten with the
   name of the column.
