PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A list of items to provide to IBM Support. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please provide the following items for analysis of an OMNIbus installation failure:
1) Problem Description :
Please give a clear, specific problem description, including specific usage information and error scenario on how to recreate the problem you encountered.

a. Is this a Product Install or Maintenance Fix install?

- Please list your Omnibus release (eg 7.3.0, 7.3.1, and 7.4)
- Please confirm the Part Number downloaded
- If installing a fix, please confirm the fix name (for example: Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 7.3.1 Fix Pack 5).

b. How did you perform the Install (Console, Launchpad, Executable file, Silent)
c. Type of Install (Simple or Advanced)
d. Is it a standalone Omnibus distribution, or is it an Integration? If an Integration, please confirm the other components which have already been installed.
e. Which user performed the installation - for example root user or non-root user
f. Did you take any screen shots of any errors during the installation? If so please send these.
g. Was the installation attempted more than once?
h. What Operating System platform are you installing on?
Operating System (Type and Version) information


2) Product Information and Logs :

The Deployment Engine based Netcool/OMNIbus installer creates several log files that are put into different locations. 

Version 7.4.0 ships with a script that will bring all of these files into a single archive that can be examined more easily. This script should always be used if IBM Support ask you to send them the installer log files. 

Users of versions 7.3.0 and 7.3.1 can download this script from developerWorks (see the Related Information section below).


The script should be run by the user that ran the Netcool/OMNIbus installer since some files will be gathered from the user's home directory. If you are sending the files to IBM and you have a PMR number you can include the --pmr (UNIX) or /pmr (Windows) argument and the file will be correctly named. Otherwise omit the number and rename the file later if required. The path to the Netcool/OMNIbus installation directory (NCHOME) must be given on the command line since the script does not assume that $NCHOME or %NCHOME% is set correctly. If you have attempted to install Netcool/OMNIbus into different locations you can provide each location on the command line and files will be gathered from each. When the script finishes it will tell you where the output is. 

Usage example: 

On Unix: ./nc_install_logs --pmr 99999,999,999 /path/to/netcool/omnibus 

On Windows: cscript nc_install_logs.vbs /pmr 99999,999,999 \path\to\netcool\omnibus

You may however wish to collect this information manually - please refer to the section below that applies to the platform and installation user for your environment.

Windows

Collect the output of the following command:

C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\listIU.cmd

Collect the following information/files:

i. IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-component-host-mm-dd-yyy-hh:mm:ss-00.log

in the C:\Documents and Settings\user directory, where 

- user is the name of the user that installed the product.
- component is the name of the Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus component that was installed, for example OMNIbus-Core for the server-side components, or OMNIbus-Web_GUI for the Web GUI.
- host is the name of the host server.
- mm-dd-yyy-hh:mm:ss is the date and time the log file was first generated. Additional log files can be generated on subsequent modifications to the installation.

ii. OMNIbus_InstallLog.log

in the %NCHOME% directory (typically C:\IBM\tivoli) 

iii. If you are unable to locate these files, zip the contents of the Deployment Engine (DE) logs directory and upload the zip file to the PMR:

C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\.acsi\logs



UNIX


Collect the output of the following command:

/home/<username>/.acsi_<username>/bin/listIU.sh

(where <username> is the non-root user id used to install OMNIbus)

OR

If the installation was performed by the root user, the output of:

/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/listIU.sh 

Collect the following information files:

i. When the product is installed by a root user: 

home/IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-component-host-mm-dd-yyy-hh:mm:ss-00.log

When the product is installed by a non-root user: 

/home/user/IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-component-host-mm-dd-yyy-hh:mm:ss-00.log

where 

- user is the name of the user that installed the product.
- component is the name of the Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus component that was installed, for example OMNIbus-Core for the server-side components, or OMNIbus-Web_GUI for the Web GUI.
- host is the name of the host server.
- mm-dd-yyy-hh:mm:ss is the date and time the log file was first generated. Additional log files can be generated on subsequent modifications to the installation.

ii. OMNIbus_InstallLog.log

in the $NCHOME directory

iii. If you are unable to locate these files, zip the contents of the Deployment Engine (DE) logs directory and upload the to the PMR:

/home/<username>/.acsi_<username>/logs.

(Where <username> is the non-root user id used to install OMNIbus)
