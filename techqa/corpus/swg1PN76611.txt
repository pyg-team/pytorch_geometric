APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MSGEZY2027W and MSGEZY2028W are issued from the Telnet server
   for invalid data received on a connection.  However, the
   messages should only be displayed with debug/trace option.  The
   messages do not indicate an error condition by themselves.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of TCP/IP for MVS                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The frequency of message MSGEZY2027W    *
   *                      issued are filling up the log, causing  *
   *                      other important messages to be missed.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Since upgrading MVS TCP/IP to 3.1, 'MSGEZY2027W Extra data found
   after termination. It is ignored.' is issued in abundance.
   This is filling up the log causing other important messages to
   be missed very easily.
   Since this message is not an indication of a problem, it was
   decided that MSGEZY2027W and 'MSGEZY2028W Extra data found
   after FPRESENT. It is ignored.' should be issued only with
   debug trace active.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code is change to issue the messages only when DIAG7C debug
   trace is active.
