APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Windows 2000 SP4 server
   ITM 6.2
   In the C:\Winnt\system32 directory we also found approx 20,000+
   files
   named "to??????"  that contain the same error message.
   Note : we are aware that our collector is crashing as well - and
   are
   investigating IF4 of the 6.2 agent to address this. The customer
   would like a provisional fix to address the following issues:
   
   
   
   1.) temp files accumulating when there is a transaction error,
   collector/cursor/database or odbc problem. In the customers
   case, they
   were accumulating in the winnt\system32 directory. It was
   mentioned that
   this was fixed in 6.1.2 and 6.2.1 but not 6.2.0.
   
   2.) If there is an error with any of the above (in the customers
   case it
   was a transaction error), the agent should still effectively
   clean up
   the temp files from the saved location.
   
   
   Additional info:
   
   The defect the addresses the temp file location is d69735. This
   defect seems to have been placed in v6.2.1 and 6.2.1 but not
   6.2.0.
