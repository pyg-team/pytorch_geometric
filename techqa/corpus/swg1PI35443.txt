ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are receiving the following messages with your application
   code,
   DFHSJ0001 An abend (code ---/AKEA)  has occurred at offset
             X'192E' in module DFHSJIN.
   DFHSJ1007 W JVMSERVER jvmserver is being disabled by CICS
             because it is in an inconsistent state.
   DFHSJ0918 JVMSERVER jvmserver is being disabled due to a
             PHASEOUT request.
   The JVM seems to get all hung up and CICS has to be recycled
   afterwards.

   ****************************************************************
   A CICS task is running on a T8 TCB in a JVM server.  An
   unexpected abend occurs, in this case an 0C7 due to EIBTASKN
   being overlaid, which leads to CICS handling the abend and
   issuing message DFHSJ0001 and DFHSJ1007.  CICS then attempts to
   disable the JVMSERVER and re-enable it.
   
   The JVM function DestroyJavaVM() gets called to terminate the
   JVM cleanly.  This function waits for all non-daemon threads
   to complete.  The thread in the JVM that was being used by
   the abending CICS task still exists.  This prevents the JVM
   from terminating and leaves the JVMSERVER in a DISABLING state.
   
   The JVMSERVER will only get to a DISABLED state by issuing a
   Unix kill command against the process id or by terminating the
   entire CICS region.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  JVM server abend handling and recovery processing has been
   changed so that the JVMSERVER will no longer wait for an abended
   thread to complete before reaching a DISABLED state.
