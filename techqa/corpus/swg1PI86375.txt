APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the client is editing a map outputcard changing the settings
   to FILE ADAPTER > DO NOT CREATE - and then save the map, when
   they reopen the same map and change the setting from FILE
   ADAPTER>DO NOT CREATE to SINK ADAPTER then save and build the
   map, the map is still carrying the 1st step setting in run time
   and not creating the file.  It doesn't appear that the adapter
   settings are being saved.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  RTC - 61137
   CH / CH
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   Customers using ITX maps in ITXA.
   Problem Description:
   The ITX returns an error: "Unable to get InputStreams for
   response document: Card1" (or similar), when OnSuccess is set
   to "Not Create" for an output card on the map.
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution Summary:
   When ITXA overrides output cards in the ITX map, it will also
   override the OnSuccess setting in the map and set it to
   "Create".
   Note: Users can work around this error by setting OnSuccess to
   "Create" in output cards in their map.
