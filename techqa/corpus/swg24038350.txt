DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Datacap is a complete solution for document and data capture. Datacap scans, classifies, recognizes, validates, verifies, and exports data and document images quickly, accurately, and cost effectively. 

By combining the common recognition engines for OCR, ICR, OMR, and bar codes with libraries of hundreds of script-based and code-based (.NET) actions, Datacap accurately captures data from any type of structured, highly variable, or unstructured documents. 

Datacap can capture machine print, hand print, bar codes, and check box data. By using the Datacap rules engine, data capture can be tailored to fit the most demanding business requirements and can be changed quickly when business needs change. 

For indexing applications, Datacap streamlines the manual data entry of index entries by using recognition to automatically identify the index values on each document and to automate the document identification process.
