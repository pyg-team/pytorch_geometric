ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PT Memory error when attempting section
   view on Transmis
   Operating System:  HP-UX 11
   Product Group:  CATIA V5R10 on HP-UX
   Service Level/Type: ServicePack3
   Area Affected:GENDRAFT
   Showstopper: YES
   Regression: YES
   Regression from: V5R10sp1
   Recommended Fixes Installed: YES
   Problem:
   
   Fails with V5R10sp2 and V5R10sp3.
   1.  Load assembly in Design mode.
   2.  Create a new empty CATDrawing.
   3.  Use the front view icon and create the Front
   view of the Trans assembly.
   4.  Place the Front view.
   5.  Select the Section view icon and create a
   section view from the Front   view.
   6.  Indicate place to Section  view.
   Note receive memory error and cannot create the
   view. Dassault has models need for this test from
   APAR HD01290.   This functionallity was a big
   selling point to our customers. Now it no longer
   works.
   This was done on a high end HP CAE machine.
   *****
   Update's customer  :
   This PMR only fails on large assemblies containing
   several hundred parts. This has always failed on
   AIX, SGI and Windows 2000. There is another PMR
   for those operating systems. This did work on an
   HP in V5R10 sp1. We opened this PMR becouse the
   HP which was working   is now failing in V5R10 sp2
   and Sp3.
   -
   Tested on HP CAE machine with 2G of memory and
   a high end graphics card.
   I performed the same scenario of opening all 334
   V4 models in Design  mode and creating an
   assembly drawing.
   V5R9sp3 - created Section view in 40 minutes -
   successful 50% of the time
   V5R10 GA - created Section view in 30 minutes -
   successful 90% of the time
   V5R10sp1 - created Section view in 20 minutes -
   successful 100% of the time.  I was also able to
   creating several Projection views and  two Section
   views.
   V5R10sp2 - KO
   V5R10sp3 - KO
   I tried your suggestion of using Product FT&A
   Section view, but this also failed.  The error
   message I receive is below. I am sending Abend,
   SessionInfo, and the xxx.log.  If any additional
   traces are needed, please send detailed
   instructions.
   Pid 16449 received a SIGSEGV for stack growth
   failure.
   Possible causes: insufficient memory or swap
   space, or stack size exceeded maxssiz.
   May I have an explanation on what is meant by
   memory pick and steps I would take to find the
   memory pick.
   In regards to the scenario, this had only worked on
   a HP CAE workstation.
   1.  Create a empty Product in V5.
   2.  Select 'Insert existing components' and add all
   models in Design mode.
   3.  Create a newCATDrawing.
   4.  Select the Front view icon and from the 3D,
   select a planer face.
   5.  Rotate the view to desired position and indicate
   to place view.
   6.  Select the Section view icon and indicate across
   the length for the section cut
   line.
   7.  Indicate the placement of the Section view.

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 11.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 13 GA level AND ON V5R12SP01 AND V5R11S
   P05.
   Note that this problem is also fixed on V5R11 SP3.
   .
   SCENARIO:
   Open product
   New drawing
   Front view (xy plane)
   Section view (plane xz)
   Save drawing.
   .
   RESULT:
   We succeeded on HP platform and on SUN platform
   .
   1) On HP:
   HP Characteristics :
   PROCESSORS = 1
   PROCESSORS Frequency = 875 MHz
   RAM = 2,147,483,648
   DISK SWAP = 2,147,483,648
   
   We configure the CNEXT executable with the
   following command, so that CATIA could work on 4
   gigabytes :
   
   chatr +q3p enable /yourpath/CNEXT
   chatr +q4p enable /yourpath/CNEXT
   
   In order to check the quadrant available for
   CNEXT :
   chatr /yourpath/CNEXT
   
   With the above command, we could check the
   memory usage :
   - On R10SP1, 2711 MegaBytes at the end of section
   processing
   - On R11SP3, 2695 MegaBytes
   - On R12BSF, 2688 MegaBytes
   .
   On SUN:
   We tested this scenario on a specific SUN platform,
   configured to run with 4 GigaBytes, the test was also successfu
   ll on R10GA and R11BSF (no other level tested)
   
   .
