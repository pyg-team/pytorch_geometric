APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When starting a BPD (with snapshot id or without) the process
   is started with the incorrect versioning context. This causes
   instance migration to not be possible if the BPD of interest is
   located inside a toolkit.

   Portal or REST API (ie.
   https://localhost:9443/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process?action=start&bpdI
   d=<bpd_id>&snapshotId=<snapshot_id>), [https://localhost:9443/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process?action=start&bpdId=<bpd_id>&snapshotId=<snapshot_id>),] if the BPD resides in a
   toolkit, Process Admin Console's ?Installed Apps? page will not
   show these active instances as part of the instance counter
   displayed under the snapshot name.
