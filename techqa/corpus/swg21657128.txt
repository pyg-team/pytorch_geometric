 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to collect JVM garbage collection data for a single IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) execution group, 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To collect garbage collection data for a single execution group, you can create a profile that contains the MQSIJVERBOSE=-verbose:gc setting for the specified execution group.
For more information about profiles that apply to specific execution groups, see the following topics:


 * Execution group-specific command environment: Linux and UNIX systems [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bh44520_.htm] 
 * Broker-specific command environment: Windows systems [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bh44525_.htm]


This facility is available from WebSphere Message Broker Version 7.0.0.2 onwards. 

For more information about using the MQSIJVERBOSE environment variable see: Questions on capturing garbage collection data in IIB \ WMB. [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/180751/questions-on-capturing-garbage-collection-data-in.html]
