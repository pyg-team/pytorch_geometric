ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1] Description:
   A strange behaviour is observed at the customer end with respect
   to the INI file. At irregular intervals Rhapsody clears the
   Rhapsody.ini file. I.e file becomes empty. This is very rare but
   has happend to most of their developers at least once. Not sure
   of the sequence of events that causes this though.
   
   
   
   
   2] More Insights from the Customer:
   
   
   a) How do you open Rhapsody 7.5.1 after ini becomes empty?
   ??Customer?? Rhapsody creates a default .ini file but what we do
   is that we copy
   from someone else. Some have also made backups of their .ini
   file.
   
   b) Does it occur randomly or is it seen suddenly when working on
   a
   particular project?
   
   ??Customer?? It seem very random (and rare).
   
   c) When you mention ini file is empty, does its size becomes 0
   bytes or
   is it corrupted in parts?
   ??Customer?? The .ini file is empty (0 bytes)
   
   
   d) When was this issue last seen?
   ??Customer?? Last seen day before yesterday.
   
   e) Is it seen after closing Rhapsody that ini file is empty?
   
   ??Customer?? In most cases it is not discovered until the next
   start of Rhapsody.
   Unfortunately there is not much I can add to this. Most times it
   is
   discovered the following day when Rhapsody is started. The last
   
   occurrence gave a bit more info in that it was discovered when
   the user tried to
   build the code. The user had just done a save (could this be
   when it
   happened?)
   
   
   f) Is a CM tool involved?
   If so, is the INI file also in CM.  In that case which CM Tool
   is used along with its version details will help.
   ??Customer?? Yes we use a CM tool (ClearCase). However the .ini
   file is not under version control.
   
   
   g) Is there a Platform or Workflow integration?
   If so Is it with eclipse or VS and how is the behavior working
   directly on Rhapsody
   ??Customer?? There is no platform/workflow integration.
   
   
   h) Is the customer working with scripts (Java API or anything
   else)?
   If so, is there any script/api which uses (read/write)
   rhapsody.ini
   ??Customer?? Yes we use Java scripts. None of them modify the
   .ini file
   
   
   i) What is the location of Rhapsody installation. Is it local
   for each developer or somewhere on the network?
   ??Customer?? The location is the default location. I.e.
   'C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.5.1
   
   
   j) Where the ini file is located? Is it right at the
   installation folder, or user profile, or some other place?
   ??Customer?? The ini file is in the installation folder
   (default).
   
   
   k) Were there rhapsody.ini files created at some unexpected
   locations?
   ??Customer?? honestly have no idea on the last question. I will
   ask around but if it was it might have ended up in a place where
   it has later on been removed. Will ask that the next time it
   happens the disks are searched.

   4] Impact Justification:
   The impact is not very high. However this is duly disturbing all
   the helper calls and other flag settings which the customer may
   have stored in the INI file once it gets deleted.
