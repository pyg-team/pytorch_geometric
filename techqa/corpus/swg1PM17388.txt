   users.
   
   Cust has a 5th realm for admin users only that they want to be
   able to login to base portal.
   
   But cust found that when non-admin users logged in to the
   virtual portals, WCM content would not show and logs had
   membernotfound errors because VMM was looking in admin realm.
