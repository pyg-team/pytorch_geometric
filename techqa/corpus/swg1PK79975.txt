 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

   Solaris SPARC CD (CD Part Number C062XEN) is an elf binary.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The installer packaged with the Packging Utility CD 1.2.1
   for solaris is the wrong installer. The installer is meant
   for solaris x86, not solaris sparc.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  - The CD image apart from the packaged installer is still
   valid and will install with an already installed
   Installation Manager.
   
   
   This has been fixed in the 1.3 version of Packaging Utility.
