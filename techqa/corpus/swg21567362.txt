PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A customer installed Web Response Time agent V7.3 on Windows server 2008 R2 in order to monitor remote network traffic. 
However, WRT agent TEP workspaces were empty. They are able to monitor remote network traffic with WRT agent installed on AIX, but couldn't do the same things with wrt agent in appliance mode on
Windows. 
TCP network capture was taken using wireshark to be sure that there is traffic on the network device they wanted to monitor. Then they set up trace levels (KBB_RAS1=ALL) and gathered logs. 

SYMPTOM
No monitoring application or transaction data shown on TEP WRT workspaces.


CAUSE
After analysing WRT logs and network packet capture, it was found that there is only traffic in one direction. 

For example there are http GET requests to <ip-address> and ACKs for the responses, but there are no packets in the other direction (those containing the response data and the 200 OK.) 
This seems to indicate the spanned port to the appliance is only supplying traffic in one direction. It was also observed some traffic on port 8080, but that port is not configured for monitoring.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows WRT v7.3



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Take a wireshark capture, and set debug levels on WRT agent, and review logs and wireshark results.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure and verify with the network administration team in your environment that the spanned/spanning port is configured for two way communications.
