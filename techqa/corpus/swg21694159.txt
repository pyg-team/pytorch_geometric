Title: IBM Why my IBM Datacap Taskmaster DotScan shows batches in verification step? - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working on IBM Datcap Taskmaster Capture 8.1.0.2. When I login to the Taskmaster DotScan tool as administrator, I can see batches listed for the verification step. Since the verification step cannot be executed from DotScan, I am not sure if I should be even allowed to see all the batches pending for the verification step. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is happening because when configuring the workflow in the Administrator tab in Taskmaster Web, the Verify task was assigned to use Multiple programs.- If it is changed to use DotEdit as the program to use for Verify, then you will not see Verify as one of the options in DotScan in the first place, so the current situation will not arise.
