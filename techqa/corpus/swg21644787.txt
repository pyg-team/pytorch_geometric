PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having an integration problem between the IBM Business Process Managerand IBM ILOG or IBM Websphere Operational Decision Management products . You would like to know what information you must collect (MustGather) so that support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support, it will expedite the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Complete the following steps to start the problem analysis: 

 * Verify whether the Rule application is working correctly and whether it gives the expected response to a given request. To verify, retrieve the HTDS WSDL file for the Rule application from the Rule Execution Server console. Use the HTDS WSDL file as an input to a tool such as the SOAP use interface. Send a request to the Rule application and see if the received response is correct or appropriate. 
   
   
 * Verify the settings for the IBM Business Process Manager process application to determine whether the correct values are provided to access the Rules application. Verify the values that are provided for the following parameters in your IBM Business Process Manager process application:  * Open the Process Application in Process Designer. Navigate to Process App Settings > Servers. On this page verify that the URL for the "ILOG Rules Server" is provided correctly. The URL needs to use the following format: 
      http://<ILOG_server_IP_address>:<ILOG_server_WC_default_host>
      
      
    * Open the JRules Decision Service component for the process application. Verify its properties to determine whether the correct ILOG Server variable is used to represent the target Rule application server. Also, verify that the correct SOAP Port, user ID, and password for the Rule application server are provided.
      
      
   
   
 * Check the production documentation about the JRules Decision Service Component using the following information center URLs :  *   * IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0mx/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/building_rule_service_C.html] 
       * IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0.1 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/building_rule_service_C.html] 
       * IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.5.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/building_rule_service_C.html]
      
      
   
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the previous information does not resolve the issue, then collect the following troubleshooting data for IBM Support: 

 

Environment description:



 * Provide the IBM Business Process Manager product version.  * In IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.x, run the versionInfo -maintenancePackages command from the bin directory of your IBM Business Process Manager product installation. Redirect the output of the command to a file.
      
      
    * In IBM Business Process Manager V8.x, run the versionInfo -fixpacks -ifixes command from the bin directory of your IBM Business Process Manager product installation. Redirect the output of the command to a file.
      
      
   
   
 * Provide the version information for IBM ILOG Server or the IBM WebSphere Operational Decision Server.
   
   
 * Provide the operating system and version details.



Detailed problem description: 

 * Describe the symptoms that you are observing. Provide the details of the error and capture a copy of the error and stack trace.
   
   
 * Provide information about the background of the problem. For example:  * Do you see the error while developing the application in Process Designer using Process Center runtime? 
    * Is this error seen when the process application is installed and running in the Process Server runtime.
   
   



Collecting diagnostic data 

 1. Recreate the issue, if possible, and complete the following steps to collect the log files and traces:  1. Stop the server, if possible, if it is possible to stop the server runtime (process center server, process server, or both).
        
        
     2. Delete or backup the existing log files and FFDC files from the Process Center or the Process Server profiles. The files are located in the following locations:  * BPM_installation_root/profiles/profile_name/logs/server_name 
         * BPM_installation_root/profiles/profile_name/ffdc/
           
           where the BPM_installation_root, profile_name, andserver_name variables are specific to your environment.
           
           
        
        
     3. Stop the Process Designer and delete or back up the existing ae.log file from the Process Designer. The file is located in the following location: Process_Designer_installation_root\ae.log
        
        
     4. Restart the Process Center and/or Process Server servers.
        
        
     5. Enable trace on all involved servers using the following trace string:
        *=info: WLE.wle_ilog=all: WLE.wle_outbnd_ws=all: com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.*=all
        
        
        For more details, see How to set up a trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21254706].
        
        
     6. Recreate the issue.
        
        
     7. Note the time stamps of the administrative tasks that you complete and the recreation attempt. You can reset the tracing, if needed.
        
        
     8. Gather all of the log files and FFDC files from the following directories:  * BPM_installation_root/profiles/profile_name/logs/server_name 
         * BPM_installation_root/profiles/profile_name/ffdc 
         * Process_Designer_installation_root\ae.log
           
           where the BPM_installation_root, profile_name, server_name and Process_Designer_installation_rootvariables are specific to your environment.
           
           
        
        
    
    
 2. Describe how the variables in the JRules Decision Service component were generated. In other words, did you use the "Generate Types" and "auto mapping" functionality in the JRules Decision Service component? Did you manually generate the business objects (BO) / variable and perform the input / output variable mapping?
    
    
 3. Provide the Rule application that can be used to recreate the issue, if possible. If providing the Rule application is not feasible, then provide the HTDS WSDL file of your Rule application. You can use the RES console to generate this HTDS WSDL file. 
    
    
 4. Demonstrate the issue, is possible, using a simple process application that invokes your JRules application. Then, provide the simplified sample application.
    
    
 5. Provide the details of the expected or actual request message to the Rule application. Also, provide the expected or actual result from the Rule application.
    
    
 6. Provide the details about the business impact that this issue has on your project. Also, provide any workarounds or alternatives that you have implemented to help you move forward with the project.
