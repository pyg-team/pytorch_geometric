APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Please refer the attached model.
   
   Model contains two packages, one referenced other local. Both of
    the packages has colliding events set which is okie within on c
   omponent.
   As Rhapsody prompts for error due to colliding event ids during
   CG.
   
   But if the same model is split into multiple components the prob
   lem occurs. So if user creates a package PKG_Test with some even
   ts in component A, they possibly have duplicate event IDs in com
   ponent B (which also uses PKG_Test)

   Collision of event ids when project is split into different
   components
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Rhapsody checks collisions between all events in the model.
   This is done because event idss must be unique inside the
   entire application space even the application was built by
   several libraries implemented as separate components. In
   addition, ids must be unique between different applications
   in case of distributed application model.
