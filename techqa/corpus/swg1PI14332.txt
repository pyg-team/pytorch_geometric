APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In case the Java session cookie is lost on the browser side, a
   running dialog can run into a stale state because reference to
   the current dialog context is lost.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no local workaround. Loosing the Java session cookie
   should not occur in a normal usage scenario.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In case the Java session cookie is lost on the browser side, a
   running dialog can run into a stale state because reference to
   the current dialog context is lost.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Dialog context manager double-checks whether there is a dialog
   context available even if this should not happen at this point
   in time.
   .
