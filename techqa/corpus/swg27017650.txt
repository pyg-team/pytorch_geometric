ABSTRACT
 This document lists the known issues for the IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr Version 1.0 Fix Pack 1.0 release. 

CONTENT
Known issues: 

 * If you check out a document with the desktop connectors and then change the title or description and save, the size is incorrectly displayed as zero. The actual content is intact. After you check in the document, the correct size is displayed.

 * The Content Engine Client Installer Version 4.5.0.0 has the following issues that impact IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr. These issues are fixed in the Content Engine Client Installer Version 4.5.0.1 or later.  * The Content Engine client installer can detect the installation path of IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr. However, even if FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr is installed on a non default location on Windows, such as: C:\Program Files\IBM\FN Services for Lotus Quickr, the Content Engine client installer detects and displays the default install path C:\Program Files\IBM\FN Services for Lotus Quickr. 
    * If FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr is installed on a non default location on the AIX platform, the Content Engine client installer detects and displays an incorrect location of: /opt/IBM/FFN Services for Quickr.  Workaround for Windows or AIX: Browse to the correct path and proceed with the installation.
      
      
   
   
 * When documents are added, checked out, modified, and checked to the FileNet P8 library, the ‘First created on’ information for the file changes to the last modified date and time. The ‘First created on’ information should display the date and time the file was first added. 
 * When searching a FileNet P8 repository in Lotus Quickr search center and the search criteria includes characters that are not valid, such as {, },and ., the following message should appear: "A problem occurred during the search. If the problem persists, contact your System Administrator." 
   
   Instead of displaying this message, the search runs, but documents are not returned.
   
   
   
 * If you use the Microsoft Windows installer, you might see the following error message: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 * If you want to use the Configuration Manager tool to deploy FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr, you must manually modify the configuration files generated by the Configuration Manager. In the deployapplication.xml file, change the following parameters from the default values to the required FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr product values.

 * 
 *  
   <value>C:\Program Files\IBM\lib\<insert product name here>\Enginews.ear</value> Replace Engine-ws.ear with the FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr product ear file
   name. For example: 
   
   C:\Program Files\IBM\FN Services for Quickr\fnqs.ear.
   
   
 * 
 * 
 *  
   FileNet Engine is the Content Engine application name. Change the value to the 
   application name for FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr product. For example: 
   FNQuickrServices. 
 * A search with a query string containing at least one hyphen (-) character might return an unexpected result because a hyphen is considered a punctuation by the P8 search engine. Examples: 
   
    * A search for 010-68967707 returns documents containing either 010-68967707, 
      or 010 68967707. 
    * A search for 9EA8249E-095A-4AFC-8244-64D9159309BE will not return 
      documents containing that exact string.
   
   
   To resolve this issue, append a wildcard character to the end of the search string. For example: a search for 9EA8249E-095A-4AFC-8244-64D9159309BE* returns documents containing 9EA8249E-095A-4AFC-8244-64D9159309BE. 
 * Users with a double-byte character in their user name cannot log on to a FileNet P8 system using the Quickr Web user interface. You get an error message saying, "Invalid credentials for remote server". 
 * On HPUX, HPUX-Itanium, and AIX platforms, the FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr uninstaller fails if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is not included in the system path. The following error message is displayed:  * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
   This issue is caused by InstallAnywhere. Work around: Add JVM to your path. 
   
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * If a folder contains only sub-folders (no documents) and the number of sub-folders displayed is a multiple of the page size, then the ATOM feed for the folder contains an unnecessary "next" link on the last page. The Lotus Quickr library viewer and the publish dialogs use ATOM feeds.
