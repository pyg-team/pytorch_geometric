ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Report consisting a graph,crosstab, list report contains same
   fields.??CQECongfig.xml has been updated with usequery=0 to
   disable the session caching.??Cognos service restarted to make
   the changes take effect.??When the database values are changed,
   the list report is getting updated. but the graph and crosstab
   showing the old values.??Graph, list report, crosstab uses three
   different queries, and 'Use Local cache' is set to blank which
   is default.??The package was published using 'Use Local Cache'
   Enabled.??Customer wants to know why there is difference in the
   behavior and what should be the expected behavior.??Successfully
   replicated the issue with Cognos samples and tested on Cognos
   8.4.1 and Cognos 8.4.1 FP2??Report specs are attached, created
   in Go Sales (Query) Package reflecting the same
   behaviour.?Kindly let us know as why the list report is behaving
   differently.??Check below link
   .??http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/c8bi/v8r4m0/index.js
   p?topic=/com.ibm.swg.im.cognos.ug_cra.8.4.0.doc/ug_cra_id7477Ena
   bleSessionCaching.html??Kindly
   explain which settings would take higher preference if we have
   different settings for query reuse at ?1. Server level -
   CQEConfig.xml =0,5,10?2. FM Level - package level - Use Local
   Cache?3. Report level - CQEConfig.xml = remove/keep?4. Query
   level - Use Local Cache??Let us know if above behaviour is a
   product intend or can be converted into a defect as list report
   getting updated from DB with updated values, but not Graph or
   Crosstab.??More to mention, Cognos temp space was
   cleared.Browser history was too cleared for the same.??Thanks
   and Regards,?Amit
