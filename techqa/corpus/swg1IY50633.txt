   They are in the process of doing a Tivoli Identity Manager
   provisioning, and WebSEAL keeps coring.
   
   Here are some parameter changes they've made, which may or may
   not be contributing to WebSEAL coring (narrative below):
   
   1. Change the slapd32.conf on r2l8.advo.com and r2l5.advo.com
   (5 Nov 2003 @ 12am)
    - ibm-slapdSizeLimit: from 500 to 0
   2.  WebSeald process crashed at  0230hrs   (6 Nov 2003 )
   3. Restarted at 8:30am, no changes to values   (6 Nov 2003 ).
   4. Ran the tim  reconciliation, at 0900hrs (6 Nov 2003)
    -  tim  reconciliation, did not bring back all TAM entries.
   5. WebSeald process crashed at 1120hrs   (6 Nov 2003 )
   6. Change slapd32.conf and ldap.conf.  approx 1130hrs  (6 Nov
   2003 )
    -  ibm-slapdSizeLimit: from 0 to 5000
    -  max-search-size from 2048 to 5000
    - restart ldap and webseal.
   7.  Ran the tim  reconciliation,  at 0100hrs  ( 6 Nov 2003)
    - TIM  reconciliation, brought back everything, all TAM
   entries.
   8. Webseald process crashed at 1355hrs  (6 Nov 2003 )
    -  ibm-slapdSizeLimit: from 5000 to 500
    -  max-search-size from 5000 to 2048.
    - restart ldap and webseal.
   9.  0900hrs 7 Nov 2003,  Webseal still running,  no crashes
   since .
    - Portal was also check at 0100hrs 7 Nov 2003, everything up
   and able to log in.
   10.  1400hrs 7 Nov 2003 , WebSeal Crashed and then restarted.
   11.  1415hrs 7 Nov 2003, WebSeal Crashed and then restarted.
   
   With ibm-slapdSizeLimit and max-search-size at their default
   settings, TIM would not reconcile all users in TAM, but
   WebSEAL didn't crash.  At that point, they were advised by
   the TIM Implementation Team to change the values for those
   two parameters.  After the changes were made to
   ibm-slapdSizeLimit and max-search-size, that's when WebSEAL
   started coring.
   
   Halfway through the TIM implementation, because of so many
   problems with TIM, they migrated from TIM 4.4 to TIM 4.5 hoping
   this would correct this issue (as well as a few others)....but
   it did not correct this particular problem.
   
   TIM 4.5 started working properly with TAM after changing
   ibm-slapdSizeLimit, but then WebSEAL crashed at 11:20am, at
   which point they changed ibm-slapdSizeLimit: from 0 to 5000 and
   max-search-size from 2048 to 5000.  Then they ran another TIM
   reconciliation, but WebSEAL crashed again at 13:55, so they
   changed ibm-slapdSizeLimit: from 5000 to 500 and
   max-search-size from 5000 to 2048 and restarted ldap and
   webseal.  Even though they have not run a TIM reconciliation
   since, WebSEAL crashed again at 2:00pm, then once again at
   2:15pm.
