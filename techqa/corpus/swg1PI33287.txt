APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the xmllib function argument is used before another
   functional map argument, the functional map is not called.
   
   Example:
   
   Variables1 is a type tree object containing an XML document.
   
   The functional map is not called and map rule output is None
   when the xmllib function is the first argument to the
   functional map.
   
   =F_Test1(xmllib->XPATH(TEXT(Variables1),
   "/properties/property[key='Name']/value", "/"),Variables1)
   
   The functional map is called and map rule produces output when
   the xmllib function argument is the last argument to the
   functional map.
   
   =F_Test1(Variables1,xmllib->XPATH(TEXT(Variables1),
   "/properties/property[key='Name']/value", "/"))
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00046224
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: Use the xmllib->XPATH() function as the last
   functional map argument.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers who use external
   functions
   
   Problem Description:
   WTX core engine does not call a functional map when it calls an
   external function as the first parameter to the functional map.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   ALL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been corrected to avoid consuming extra parameters.
