APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Firefox as your browser, you see incorrect behavior
   in scrolling select boxes in the UI. For example, when you
   select a value from a scrolling select box on a dialog, close
   and open the slect box, the scrollbar will appear at the
   location of the value that was selected, but the values that are
   displayed will be the first values in the list.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Despite the incorrect scrollbar placement, scrolling works
   normally on these boxes. Also, clicking away from the select box
   and
   opening it again will put the scroll bar in the correct
   position. The scroll bar is positioned correctly in both
   Internet Explorer and Chrome.
