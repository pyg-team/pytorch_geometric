ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is a cumulative fix release and addresses APARs and internally found issues since the release of OMNIbus 8.1.0 fix pack 9. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following defect solutions are included in this release:


IV89106
If probe-specific environment files exist, the nco_probe wrapper
script did not check and source the probe-specific environment
files. This problem is now fixed.


IV89509
Gateways perform many SQL select statements with lists of
ServerSerials in the where clause. To improve the performance of
these queries, an index is now added to the default ObjectServer
sql. Existing ObjectServers must be updated manually to benefit
from this added index, see the update sql file in the
$OMNIHOME/etc/default directory.


IV90524
An installation that is performed as root by using the
install_gui.sh script included with Core OMNIbus incorrectly
calls the Installation Manager userinst script for a
non-administrator installation, instead of the 'install' script
for an administrator installation. This incorrect call places
various files in an unexpected location, for example the
Installation Manager registry file is in
$HOME/etc/.ibm/registry/InstallationManager.dat, instead of
/etc/.ibm/registry/InstallationManager.dat. The update scripts
that are supplied with a fix pack check only the expected
location and fail to find the Installation Manager installation
location for these types of installations. This issue is now
fixed. The update scripts are now modified to check both the
expected and erroneous locations so that they can be used for fix
pack installations. You do not need to move existing
installations.


IV91125
To address possible security issues, the JRE for Tivoli
Netcool/OMNIbus V8.1.0 is updated to IBM JRE 7.0 SR9 FP60.


IV91244
Array, table & registertarget definitions are no longer
restricted to the beginning of a probe rules file. Now, you can
add these definitions anywhere it is appropriate to do so. For
example, an array can be defined in the middle of a block of rule
processing statements, immediately before use. Also, it is now
possible for a file that contains a definition to be included
multiple times in the set of rules that are read by a probe. For
more information about probe rules files, see the 'Probe and
Gateway' documentation.

repository in the preferences before you update. Each package must

Administrator or Nonadministrator mode, run the update_gui
script to launch Installation Manager into the update panel
without the requirement of configuring the update repository.
3. If the script fails, or Installation Manager is installed in
Group mode, or you want to run in console mode, then you must
configure the update repository as in the Local Repository
