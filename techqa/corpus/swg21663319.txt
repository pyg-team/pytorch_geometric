Title: IBM Customers indexing Arabic or Hebrew data should not upgrade to Content Manager OnDemand for i Version 7.1 without PTF SI52366 - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 A problem was discovered on Version 7.1 of Content Manager OnDemand for i where Arabic or Hebrew data was not being indexed correctly when using instances created with language CCSID 420 (Arabic) or 424 (Hebrew). This issue has now been resolved with PTF SI52366. 

CONTENT
As background, Content Manager OnDemand for i development identified a problem early in 2014 with instances created with language CCSID 420 or 424 (Arabic or Hebrew). If you have Common Server applications that capture data in those bidirectional languages, the index data might be stored incorrectly in the database files starting at server version 8.5.0.5. The problem can be observed in the hit list for the reports loaded into Content Manager OnDemand for i Common Server at server version 8.5.0.5 or higher. The Arabic or Hebrew index data that was loaded at server version 8.5.0.5 or higher will be incorrect. Index data loaded into Common Server prior to server version 8.5.0.5, or index data that is not bidirectional data (such as English), will be stored and displayed correctly.


This issue is now resolved with PTF SI52366. All V7.1 customers running Arabic or Hebrew instances at server level 8.5.0.5 should apply this PTF immediately. See the Related information section below if you need to determine your server level or need PTF information or server version details.

If you are running i5/OS and Content Manager OnDemand for i version 6.1 (5761RD1), there is no problem because the latest server version at that release is 8.4.1.9. 

If you have any questions about the information above, please contact IBM software support for further assistance.
