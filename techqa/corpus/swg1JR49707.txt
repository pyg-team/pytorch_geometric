APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create a managed profile by using the BPMConfig
   command and specify a ports file for the node agent by using
   the "bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions=-portsFile portdef.props"
   property setting in the configuration properties file, the
   ports file is ignored and the node agent is created with the
   WebSphere port assignments.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)          *
   *                  V8.5.0.1 Advanced, Standard, and Express    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The BPMConfig command did not pass      *
   *                      the -portsFile setting from the         *
   *                      bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions            *
   *                      configuration property when it          *
   *                      created the node agent of a managed     *
   *                      profile. As a result, the node agent    *
   *                      did not receive the customized port     *
   *                      assignments.                            *

   command and specify a ports file for the node agent by using
   the "bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions=-portsFile portdef.props"

   WebSphere port assignments.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 that ensure the
   BPMConfig command passes the '-portsFile' option (if
   specified) in bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions to the node agent
   creation.

   IS A WORKAROUND AVAILABLE? (Y/N)
   Yes. Complete the following steps:
    1.Create the deployment manager profile by using any of the
   supported configuration paths. For more information, see
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;Configuring profiles and creating a network deployment
   environment &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;

   ic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpmps.doc/topics/cfg_nd_prof_sol.html).
    2.Start the deployment manager.
    3.Run "manageprofiles -create -templatePath BPM/BpmNode
   -portsFile portdef.props &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#166;" (where the ellipsis ( &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#166;) s
   the other parameters you have in your scenario), following
   this guidance:
   Do not set the -federateLater option.
   Set the -nodeName parameter to bpm.de.node.#.name from the
   configuration properties file.
   Do not set the "-cellName" parameter. It will be retrieved
   from the deployment manager.
   Set the -dmgrHost, -dmgrPort, -dmgrAdminUserName, and
   -dmgrAdminPassword parameters appropriately for the connection
   to the running deployment manager.
   
    4.Run BPMConfig or the administrative console Deployment
   Environment wizard to create the deployment environment.
