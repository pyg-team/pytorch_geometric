APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Process Designer, while saving a Coach after adding a button
   (or something else) everything's ok in the first 3 Saves.  But
   there is a slight delay in response time between each save,  but
   the save works.
   Then, when we make the 4th save, Process Designer stops
   responding.  There is a "Saving"  message and in the window
   title a "Not Responding" .
   After that a new window "Refreshing Library" also
   with "Not Responding".
   After this, Process Designer stops working and in the
   installation folder some heapdumps and javacore dumps are
   created. The Process Designer interface, becomes grey and stops
   working.
      The cause of this is a memory leak.  Analysis of the
   heapdump shows these objects being leaked

LOCAL FIX
 *  We are able to kill the process and restart.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If user is working in a fairly large process application or
   toolkit, with many coach views, Process Designer will run out of
   memory after a short amount of time after doing a variety of
   actions (such as saving changes to editors, or even
   opening/closing coach view artifacts).
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard and Express users
   leveraging New Generation Coaches and Coach views in a fairly
   large workspace.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   Code change introduced in 8.0.1 included a static resource.  The
   static resource set, while improving temporal performance,
   introduced a memory leak because all loaded layouts were never
   being released from memory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Removed the static resource set, and introduced proper resource
   set usage while still maintaining temporal performance goals.
