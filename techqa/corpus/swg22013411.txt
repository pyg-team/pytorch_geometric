Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been reported for IBM SDK for Node.js. IBM Business Process Manager includes a stand-alone tool for editing configuration properties files that is based on IBM SDK for Node.js. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the \"error state\" mechanism when directly calling SSL_read() or SSL_write() for an SSL object after receiving a fatal error. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the decryption or encryption process and perform unauthorized actions.which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
