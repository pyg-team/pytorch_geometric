PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users who use DTS with MQ Messaging
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   - DTS does not put link identifier for log messages
   When DTS has multiple input links and an error occurs during
   processing a link, the error message does not have link
   identifier.
   
   - DTS does not abort on startup if log queue or reject queue is
   invalid
   When invalid queue name is specified as log queue or reject
   queue, DTS continues the job and write warning message to
   inform that DTS failed to close the log queue or the reject
   queue at the end of the job.
   
   - Writing to log queue from DTS is intermittent
   When using log queue, DTS does not write to log queue
   intermittently.
   
   - Connector stage reports wrong stage name in log when multiple
   Connectors are used in a job
   When multiple Connectors are used in a job, DTS/Connector
   stages logs messages from a Connector stage as if it is reported
   from another Connector stage.
