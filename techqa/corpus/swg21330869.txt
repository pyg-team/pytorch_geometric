AppScan Standard uses the Rational Common Licensing system, and follows it's licensing processes as described below.

Licenses in LKC 
 * 
 * AppScanStandard
 * 

 * Node-locked license
   
   A Node-locked license is tied to the machine where you install the AppScan Standard product. The license allows you to open and use AppScan Standard instances on the particular machine only. You import the license key into the machine using the License Key Administrator, a tool installed by default when installing AppScan Standard (Note: License Key Server is not needed to manage this type of license key). 
   
   In the License Key Center [https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login] the key is called "IBM Security AppScan Standard Authorized User Single Install License Key ".
   
   If you open the license file (.upd) in a text editor, the license key looks like this:
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330869&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330869&aid=1]
   
 * Floating license
   
   Floating licenses are managed by License Key Server. When having a Floating license you need to install License Key Server, and import it into the License Server using it's tool called License Key Administrator. 
   
   The advantage of this license type is that you can install AppScan Standard on any machines that has TCP/IP connection to the machine where the License Key Server is installed. AppScan pulls a license from the License Server. The license is checked out when you open an AppScan Standard instance, and returned when AppScan Standard is closed. The license usage is described in How AppScan Standard use licenses [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21505444]. 
   
   In the License Key Center [https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login] the key is called "IBM Security AppScan Standard Floating User Single Install License Key"
   
   If you open the license file (.upd) in a text editor, the license key looks like this:
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330869&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330869&aid=2]

If you have both licenses installed in your system, AppScan will use the Node-locked license before a Floating license.

Common Licensing scenarios 

A) Installing a new AppScan Standard installation 
 *  Obtain your licenses
   The licenses can be obtained from the License Key Center [https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login]. Check the presentation at: How to generate license keys at License Key Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665366]. 
   Install License Key Server 
   You need to use a License Key Server only if using Floating license keys. If you already have a License Key Server installed to serve another product, you may use that License Key Server for AppScan Standard licensing as well. For a new installation, refer to the technote How to install License Key Server [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664788]. 
   Import the licenses into License Key Server (Floating) or AppScan Standard (Notelocked). Consult technote How to import license keys into Appscan Standard [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21381093]. 


B) Upgrading AppScan Standard  *  
   AppScan Standard licenses work with all versions of AppScan Standard. Therefore, when you upgrade AppScan Standard to a later version, you do NOT need to upgrade or renew AppScan Standard licenses. 
   
   However, if you upgrade from AppScan Standard version 8.0.0.3 or earlier to version 8.5 or later, there are two possible issues to deal with:  * If using Floating licenses, you will need to upgrade your License Key Server to version 8.1.2 or later. 
    * If your AppScan still uses a legacy Watchfire license, you will need to upgrade them to Rational Common Licenses, since legacy Watchfire licenses do not work with AppScan Standard 8.5 or later. 
   
   
 * 
   

C) Moving AppScan Standard installation to another machine
 *  If using a Nodelocked license, you need to return the current key to the License Key Center [https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login], and to generate a new license key for the new machine. For details consult the technote: How to transfer License Key Server or license keys [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686972]. If using Floating licenses and the License Key Server resides on another machine (which is not impacted by the move), you do not need to upgrade either the license keys or the License Key Server. After the installation on the new machine is completed, just point the new License Key Administrator (installed with the new AppScan Standard installation) to the current License Key Server. For details refer to technote: How to import license keys into Appscan Standard [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21381093]. If using Floating licenses, and the License Key Server is installed on the same machine and is going to be moved to the new machine, you will need to return the license keys before generating new keys for the new machine. For details refer to technote: How to transfer License Key Server or license keys [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686972]. 
   Then proceed with the scenario for A) Installing a new AppScan Standard installation.
