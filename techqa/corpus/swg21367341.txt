Title: IBM Error 'specified database and the publish for datamart database don't have the same provider' when saving Data Mart definition - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I.T. administrator logs onto the Controller application server, and launches 'IBM Cognos Controller Configuration'. Administrator selects 'Database connections for publish to datamart', and chooses the relevant database connection. Administrator fills in the sections (for example 'Provider', 'User ID', 'Password' etc) and clicks 'save'. 

Administrator receives error message. 

SYMPTOM
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21367341&amp;aid=1] 

The specified database and the publish for datamart database don't have the same provider.


CAUSE
Controller only supports publishing datamarts to the same type of database as the application's repository database.

In other words, the following are supported: 

 * Microsoft SQL application repository (source) <=supported_publish=> MS SQL data mart (target) 
 * Oracle application repository <=supported_publish=> Oracle data mart target 
 * DB2 application repository <=supported_publish=> DB2 data mart target.

ENVIRONMENT
The source database (the Controller application database repository) uses one provider (for example DB2's IBMDADB2.DB2COPY1)... 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21367341&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21367341&aid=2]

...but the Data Mart (target) is configured to use a different provider (for example Microsoft SQL's SQLNCLI11.1):
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21367341&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21367341&aid=3]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the same values for 'provider' as in both the 'application' database connections and 'data mart' connections configuration sections.
