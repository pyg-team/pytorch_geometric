APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) is vulnerable to cross-site
   scripting (XSS) because user-supplied input is improperly
   neutralized in some error situations. A remote attacker could
   exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted URL to
   run a script in your web browser within the security context of
   the hosting web site when the URL is clicked. An attacker could
   use this vulnerability to steal your cookie-based authentication
   credentials.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Process Portal might return unvalidated user input in some
   error situations, which results in a cross-site scripting (XSS)
