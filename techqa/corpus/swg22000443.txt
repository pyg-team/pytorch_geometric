CVEID: CVE-2017-3231 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3231]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Networking component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a low confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120865 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120865] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
