QUESTION
 How to change time zone settings on SAN in IBM PureData System for Operational Analytics ? 

ANSWER
Here is how you can change SAN time. Note that you need to reboot the SAN for any changes to take effect. 
san02:FID128:admin> date
Tue Dec 2 10:20:46 JST 2014
san02:FID128:admin> tsTimeZone 'America/Toronto'
System Time Zone change will take effect at next reboot
san02:FID128:admin> date
Mon Dec 1 20:21:04 EST 2014

Notice that the date command is immediately affected, but a peek at the command log shows that to take affect in the logs a reboot is likely required. You can see that even after changing the time zone, the logging time does not change. It changes after reboot.

SAN reboots are best performed with the system quiesced as this limits I/O and churn on the system.

As long as the SANs are rebooted one at a time, and that the paths are checked prior to and in between reboots, it is safe. Always verify that all paths are healthy prior to and after any SAN reboot. There should be no paths returned in the count that are not enabled. 

The following command counts all paths that are not Enabled across the cluster.

dsh -n "${ALL}" 'lspath | grep hdisk | grep -vc Enabled'
alonghostname01: 0
alonghostname02: 0
alonghostname04: 0
alonghostname03: 0
