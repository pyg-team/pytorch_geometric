APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to stop a application server on WPS for z/OS the
   servant shuts down, but not completely as there is a remaining
   hanging thread.
   
   The reason for this is that a JMS connection is trying to be
   closed on a finalize block while the messaging engine is already
    stopped.
   
   So the close call never returns.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When attempting to stop an application server on WebSphere
   Process Server for z/OS the servant shuts down, but not
   completely as there is a remaining hanging thread.
   The reason for this is that a JMS connection is trying to be
   closed in a finalize() method. This happens when the messaging
   engine is already stopped and as a result the close call never
   returns.
   The JMS connection is designed to stay open as long as the BPEL
   engine is alive, because the connection is used in system
   failure scenarios.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When running on z/OS the JMS connection is no longer closed in
   the finalize() method.
