WAS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes an issue when installing a fix pack for WebSphere Application Server v7.0 on the IBM i. 

SYMPTOM
The following messages are thrown during WAS v7.0 fix pack installation: 

"Another restoration may be in progress. Unable to install fixpack."


ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Application Server V7.0


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem 


Installation of a WebSphere Application Server v7.0 fix pack on the IBM i fails with the following messages:

Unable to restore /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/V7/UPDI/maintenance/7.0.0-WS-WAS-i5osPPC-FP000000x.pak. Another restoration may be in progress. Unable to install fixpack. Maintenance package not found at location /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/V7/UPDI/maintenance/7.0.0-WS-WAS-i5osPPC-FP000000x.pak 

Investigation into the failure found the was_install_root/bin/_restoreFixPackFile700x script failed before clearing the work area /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/V7/UPDI/i5OSPackFileFragments/.

where was_install_root = /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/AppServer/<version>/<edition>

When reviewing the work area location, a temporary directory was found. The TEMP directory should not exist in this work area and will prevent the fix pack installation from completing successfully.

/QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/V7/UPDI/i5OSPackFileFragments/7.0.0-WS-WAS-i5osPPC-FP000000x-TEMP

where x is the fix pack number you are attempting to install. For example, this is the directory for fix pack 7.0.0.7: 7.0.0-WS-WAS-i5osPPC-FP0000007-TEMP

Resolution

You should remove the TEMP directory and its contents from the fix pack work area by doing the following:

1. Issue the STRQSH command.
2. Issue the following command:
rm -rf /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/V7/UPDI/i5OSPackFileFragments/7.0.0-WS-WAS-i5osPPC-FP000000x-TEMP
3. Rerun the installFixPack700x script to complete the fix pack installation process.
