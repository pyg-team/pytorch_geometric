ABSTRACT
 Micha≈Ç Zalas and fellow members of the IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) Support and Testing teams shared information on scanning with ILMT and IBM BigFix Inventory (BFI). 

CONTENT
The goal of this session was to present basic steps which allow ILMT/BFI users to verify if hardware capacity and software inventory scan actions that are run from IBM Endpoint Manager (IEM, also known as IBM BigFix) console succeed. Such review is important to avoid unexpected results in ILMT/BFI console like notifications about missing scans, capacity data or PVU calculations.




At the end of the presentation, we opened the call to take questions from the audience. Throughout the event, attendees commented and asked questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting Web chat. It was an interactive, educational, lively session. 


 * Topic: Verifying if ILMT / BFI scans run successfully 
 * Date: Wednesday, 24 February 2016 
 * Time: 11:00 AM EST (16:00 UTC/GMT, UTC-5 hours) for 60 minutes

This Open Mic session was the first webcast of 2016 provided by ILMT Technical Support. Our goal is to provide insight on how the License Metric Tool and BigFix Inventory work, and to teach on-going sessions that help both users and administrators understand, maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve issues.
