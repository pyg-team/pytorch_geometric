APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have a stream that uses a TABLE OUTPUT node to export data
   into .csv format. Using SPSS Modeler Client 17.0 and Modeler
   Server 17.0 , the stream executes as expected and all values are
   written to the .csv file.
   
   When the same stream is uploaded to C&DS 7.0 repository and is
   executed, the first 501 out of 988 respondents contain the
   correct values. The next 487 respondents are written as $null$
   values for all fields.
   
   Model nugget was originally built in Modeler 15, but has since
   been recreated using Modeler 16-FP2 and 17.0. Issue remains when
   using rebuilt model.
   
   There is also another use case regarding this issue. If you use
   C&DS 7.0 to write to a location using an UNC path (e.g.
   \\myserver\myshare), the first time the job is executed, the
   .csv file is created successfully without issue. However, any
   attempts to write over this file will result in all values being
   written as $null$.
   
   Using C&DS Deployment Manager 7.0, if you change the file format
   of the exported file (in the Results tab of the Modeler job
   step) to HTML or .tab (Tab Delimited), the exported file is
   written correctly.
   
   Environment used for testing:
   C&DS - 7.0
     > Windows Server 2008 R2
     > WAS Base 8.5.5
     > DB2 10.5 repository DB
     > JDK 1.6.0 v25
   
   Modeler Server - 17.0
     > Windows Server 2012 R2
   
   Modeler Client - 17.0
     > Windows 7 SP1
   
   
   A .csv file format should be written correctly and data should
   not be lost during C&DS job execution.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the Deployment Manager > Modeler job-step > Results tab,
   change the file format from Comma delimited (.dat) to HTML or
   Tab delimited. This will ensure your exported data is written
   correctly.
