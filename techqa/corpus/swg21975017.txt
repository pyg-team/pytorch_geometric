Title: IBM Initialization of Audio/Video plugin fails behind HTTP Proxy configured with authentication - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
 

When the IBM Sametime Audio-Video plug-in is updated on the server, it gets pushed to the client silently. However, if there's a proxy configured that requires HTTP authentication, you might receive one of the following errors:

- Error: If the problem persists, contact your administrator

- Error: The conference call plug-in failed to update. CAUSE
This issue occurs if Windows attempts to make a connection to SSL revocation hosts to check for certificate revocation. These requests fail because access credentials for the HTTP proxy server have not been requested from the user.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Complete the following steps:

Internet Explorer browser

1. Open Internet Explorer.

2. Click Tools -> Internet Options.

3. Click the Advanced tab and then scroll to the Security section.

4. Clear the checkmark from the Check for server certificate revocation setting, and then click OK. 

5. Restart Internet Explorer.


Firefox browser

1. Open Firefox browser.

2. Navigate to Firefox Tools -> Options.

3. Click the Advanced tab and then switch to the Certificates section.

4. Clear the checkmark from Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates.

5. Restart Firefox.


This setting can be reverted once the initial download and initialization is successful.
