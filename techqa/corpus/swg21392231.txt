PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, clearmake: Warning: Unable to open CR cache file .abe.state - File exists, that can occur when using IBM Rational ClearCase clearmake. 

SYMPTOM
 

Several developers seeing the following error messages after compile phase and before the install phase of clearmake.

symptom 1:
clearmake: Warning: Unable to open CR cache file .abe.
state00xxxxuser.us.company.com.000014 - File exists

In some cases, the build seems to be uneffected.

In a few instances, these errors were followed by:

Symptom 2:
--- build completed on Mon Jun 22 07:57:32 2009 (00:08:01) 
### Build failed: 1 [8 min, 3 sec] [component_compile_log.txt] ###

Symptom 3:
Sometimes the builds get stuck and do not complete in a timely manner.

What is the purpose of the .abe. files in the build and what needs to be done about them? 

clearmake: Warning: Unable to open CR cache file .abe.
state00xxxxuser.us.company.com.000014 - File exists


CAUSE

The .abe files are temporary files created and used during the build, and messages about 
them can be ignored as long as the build does not hang or fail. Files can sometimes remain from earlier aborted or failed build attempts, or improper cleanup.

Another possible cause is a user script that attempts to access clearcase temporary files in the build directory. Any script that is attempting to repackage files in the build directory needs to either ignore the current directory that the build starts from, or ignore the ClearCase specific files (.cmake.state, .mvfs_xxxxx, and .abe.state files) that may be present in the directories.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

Check for .abe. files in the build directories in the clearcase container files (before starting a new build. If they exist, they can be safely deleted. In the build directories:
on Unix: 
find . -name "*.abe.state*" -print
./.s/00015/80002322414630e4.abe.state009518mname5.000013

on Windows, use the search command to look for files named *.abe.state*.
(start>search>for files or folders>(all files and folders)

.\.s\00015\80001234567ab4.abe.state009518mname5.000013



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Symptom 1: If the build succeeds, the error messages can be ignored.

Symptom 2 and 3) If the build hangs or fails, then the user should delete the .abe. files from the build area before starting a new clearmake.

Unix:
find . -name *.abe.* -print to see what files remain from earlier builds
rm *.abe.state* 

Windows:
del *.abe.state*
