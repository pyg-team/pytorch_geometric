sdcp PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Sdcp is an Open System Services (OSS) shell script that can be used to collect and package important data from a WebSphere MQ installation on an HP NonStop Server system. 

CONTENT
The sdcp tool was initially distributed with WebSphere MQ HP NonStop Server Fix Pack V5.3.1.5. This tool continues to be revised as improvements and code fixes are applied. At this time, the newest version of the sdcp tool is packaged with WMQ HP NonStop Fix Pack V5.3.1.9. Customers who have not applied Fix Pack 5.3.1.9 or later, should download the attached sdcp archive and manual at the bottom of this technote. IBM highly recommends that you use the latest version of the sdcp tool.


NOTE: The sdcp tool will only be provided with subsequent Fix Packs if an enhancement or fix has been added to the utility. As such, not all Fix Packs will contain the sdcp tool.


Fix Pack V5.3.1.9 applied


 1. From the OSS command line, switch to a directory where you want the collected doc files to be stored (for example - /tmp). Note: if you use the -w (working directory) parameter, it does not matter where you execute the command from. The files will be stored in your working directory. 
 2. Execute the tool with the specified parameters as per the attached Scpd.pdf file. If the data is submitted to IBM WebSphere MQ technical support, then include the -p parameter. Note that the command must be entered in lower case.  * Example command:
       sdcp -w /home/mike -m QM1 -p 99999,7TD,000  * -w work directory 
        * -m queue manager 
        * -p pmr number
       
       
    
    
 3. Monitor for completion, this will take several minutes. 
 4. Verify existence of final tar file in either the 'temp' or 'working' directory. The file will have the following suffix - "-archive.tar.Z". 
 5. Submit the file to IBM as instructed by your support engineer or through ECuRep. See: Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21392217]
