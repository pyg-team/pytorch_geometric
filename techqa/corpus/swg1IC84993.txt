APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The default SSL Proxy Profile for the Web and XML
   Management Interfaces should contain one subject
   certificate and two CA certificates.  In the 5.0.0.0 release on
   the 9235 and 4195 platforms, the two CA certificates in this
   default SSL Proxy Profile contain the wrong contents and the SSL
   handshake will send only the subject certificate
   instead of all three.
   
   The SSL client attempting to make this connection might refuse
   to validate the certificate chain because of this.
   
   The 7198 and 7199 platforms are not affected by this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure an SSL Proxy Profile other than the default one for
   the Web and XML Management Interfaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users of 5.0.0.0 firmware on a 9235 or 4195 platform running
   the Web or XML Management Interfaces using
   their default SSL Proxy Profiles might experience certificate
   validation problems with some SSL clients.
   
   The problem is due to the SSL server in this default SSL Proxy
   Profile failing to send two of the three certificates that it
   should send.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 5.0.0.1.
