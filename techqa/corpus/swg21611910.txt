Title: IBM Collecting Data: AEL performance issues - United States

Text:
AEL; active event list; webgui TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data to collect in the case of a repeatable situation of an AEL (Active Event List) failing to load, hanging, reporting an error or greying out 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Firstly, please ensure that you have increased the memory available to the JVM for the JRE plugin. Go to Java Control Panel > Java tab > Java Applet Runtime Settings section > view ... > Java Runtime Parameters: 

-Xmx256M -Xms64M 

Apply and OK. After this please see whether the problem can still be reproduced. If not, that is the solution. If so, please leave these settings in place and follow these steps: 

 

Enable WebGUI client-side debug mode: 

1. Go to Java Control Panel > Java tab > Java Applet Runtime Settings section > view ... > Java Runtime Parameters:
-Djavaplugin.logging=true -Djavaplugin.trace=true -Djavaplugin.trace.option=5 -Djavaplugin.outputfiles.overwrite=false -Dtivoli.ncw.applet.debuglevel=5

2. Ensure the following settings are set:
Go to Java Control Panel > Advanced tab > Debugging
Enable tracing
Enable logging

3. Ensure the Java Console is displayed when an applet is loaded :
Go to Java Control Panel > Advanced tab > Java Console > Show Console

4. Close all opened browsers. (This is required for the above changes to take effect)

5. Go to C:\Documents and Settings\<current_windows_user>\Application Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\log directory and delete all the files inside it. (if any)

Enable WebGUI server-side debug:

1. Edit ../omnibus_webgui/etc/server.init and set
log.level=FINEST
log.maxsize=40
log.count=40
2. Restart TIP

Temporarily enable object server debug logging:

Open nco_config (OMNIbus Administrator) and go to the Properties screen
MessageLevel = debug
MaxLogFileSize = 1024000
No restart is required

Tail ../logs/ncw/ncw.0.log and replicate the problem.
Take note of the following:
- Behaviour observed
- User used in the test
- Filter used by the AEL
- Exact timestamp when the problem occurred
- Take a screenshot of the behaviour

Collect the following for Technical Support:
1 full tar of {TIPHOME}/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/* [Web GUI 7.4] or $JazzSMHOME/profile/logs/* [Web GUI 8.1]
2 full tar of ../omnibus_webgui/etc/*
3 Screenshot of the behaviour (if applicable)
4 C:\Documents and Settings\<current_windows_user>\Application Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\log\*
or
C:\Documents and Settings\<current_windows_user>\Application Data\IBM\Java\Deployment\log\*
5 Object server log and profiler log from under netcool/omnibus/log
6 Row counts from the object server alerts database:
select count(*) from alerts.status
select count(*) from alerts.details
select count(*) from alerts.journal 
7 Filter name and user name used in the test
8 Description of the behaviour observed
9 Details of browser version and JRE plugin version used in the test
