Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Do leap seconds affect Connect:Direct? 

CAUSE
A leap second is a one second adjustment that is applied to UTC time to remain consistent with atomic time. Occasionally a second is added or removed from a day so that time differences between the two time measurements never exceed 0.9 seconds. On December 31, 2016, during the last second of the day, a new leap second will be added to global time. 

ANSWER
During numerous validations performed over the years, we have not encountered this issue. There has been several leap seconds over the years through the history of Connect:Direct (i.e. Dec 2008, June 2012, June 2015) however our customers have never encountered an issue in their production environments.
