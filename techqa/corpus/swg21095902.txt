QUESTION
Notes does not allow information in Rich Text fields (RTF) to appear in the columns of views. Is there any workaround?

ANSWER
By applying @Abstract, a designer can display Rich Text information in view columns. 

For example, you have a Rich Text field called Body. To display text information from the Body field, create a computed field called TextForView, which grabs the text information from the Rich Text field. The formula could be:

@Abstract( [TextOnly] ; 15360 ; "" ; "Body")

The value 15360 is the maximum value that can be used. This is because a text field cannot display greater than 15360 characters in a view column. The designer of the view may want to consider what the maximum number of characters they want to display is, and use that value within the @Abstract formula. 

Then, in the view column formula, reference the field, TextForView.
If applying this function to existing documents the documents need to be refreshed (or edited and saved) to populate the computed field (TextForView in this example). To refresh selected documents create a SmartIcon/Toolbar icon with the following formula:

@Command([ToolsRefreshSelectedDocs])

It is necessary for the column formula to reference a secondary computed field containing the @Abstract formula because this function was not recommended for use within column formulas. See the Programmer's Guide for "Where does this @function work?" to determine in which context an @function will work.
