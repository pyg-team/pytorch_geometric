QUESTION
 How can I change the language of my Deployment Manager (PEM) installed on my PC? 
I installed SPSS Collaboration And Deployment Services Deployment Manager (PEM) Windows 32 Multilingual on my pc. 

ANSWER
Change the local settings on your pc via control panel > regional and language options > regional options tab > standards and formats panel > select the appropriate setting (for example English) and click on the apply button. 

If you don't want the change these settings on your PC , add the line osgi.nl=<language> to the config.ini file of your deployment manager installation (for a 4.2 installation this file is located by default at C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Collaboration and Deployment Services\4.2\Deployment Manager\configuration). 
To activate this change you have to close and restart your Deployment Manager.

Note: Replace the <language> value of the osgi.nl parameter by the language of your choice. For example osgi.nl=en_EN will set the language to English. 


Below you find a part of the osgi.ini file illustrating how it could look like. The # at the first position means that the line is put in comment. 
.....
# The comma-separated list of locations to search for the splash screen file (splash.bmp).
# For each list element a subdirectory structure based on the pattern nl/<locale> is searched.
# The system binds to the first matching file. There is no default value.
osgi.splashPath = platform:/base/plugins/com.spss.mgmt.common.application.product

# The location of the splash screen file. If this value is set at system startup it is used 
# in favour of the osgi.splashPath searching outlined above. If the value is not set 
# the searching is done and this key is bound to the result of the search.
#osgi.splashLocation =

#language settings
osgi.nl=fr_FR
#osgi.nl=en_EN

# The comma-separated list of bundles which are automatically installed and optionally started
# once the system is up and running. Each entry if of the form
# <URL | simple bundle location>[@ [":start"]] 
# If the startlevel is omitted then the framework will use the default start level for the bundle. 
# If the "start" tag is added then the bundle will be marked as started after being installed. 
# Simple bundle locations are interepreted as relative to the framework's parent directory. 
# The startlevel indicates the OSGi start level at which the bundle should run. 
# If this value is not set, the system computes an appropriate default. 
osgi.bundles=org.eclipse.equinox.common@2:start, org.eclipse.update.configurator@3:start, org.eclipse.core.runtime@start
