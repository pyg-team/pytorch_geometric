Title: IBM Unable to log into Web Console after changing to LDAP authentication in IBM InfoSphere Information Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installed WebSphere Application Server on new server and converted from local OS authentication to LDAP authentication. When trying to log into Web Console after conversion to LDAP authentication, getting the following error: 

"you are not allowed to access this area" 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Tried using the DirectoryAdmin command script to add a user, but it is still not working. However, when you use a different password, you get a different error during login attempt, therefore, you can rule out password issue.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You may need to find the full Distinguished Name that is being used. To do that, perform the following: 

 1.  Login to WAS Administrative console. 
 2.  On the welcome page go to Security > Global security 
 3.  In the Global security page, under Authentication section expand JAASConfiguration. 
 4.  Click on System logins 
 5.  In the preferences table, click on 
     WEB_INBOUND if you are troubleshooting authentication problems from a web client or RMI_INBOUND if you are using EJB client (Mozart or command line tool etc), 
     and then click on JAAS login modules link under Additional properties. 
 6.  Click on the link:
     com.ascential.acs.security.auth.module.websphere.ASBIdentityLoginModule 
 7.  Click on Custom properties under Additional properties 
 8.  Now click on new button; in the resultant page, set name to "debug" and value to "true"(Note: Enter both strings without the quotes). 
 9.  Click OK, save link in the top screen and then save button to commit the change. 
 10. Restart the WAS. 
 11. Log into the Information Server Web Console and then check the SystemOut.log of WAS for the userid. Please use this fully qualified id as an argument for DirectoryAdmin script 
 12. Use the following command to set Information Server to recognize the id as the IS Administrator:
     DirectoryAdmin -user -admin -userid "fullyQualifiedLDAPUserID"
     Note: The double quotes are required.


If that does not work, please try the following: 

On Windows: 

C:\IBM\InformationServer\ASBServer\bin\DirectoryAdmin.bat -user -admin -userid <user name> -password <password> 

Note: on windows use the fully qualified user name (e.g., HOSTNAME\username) 

On Unix/Linux: 

/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/bin/DirectoryAdmin.sh -user -admin -userid <user name> -password <password>
