Title: IBM How to enable RSVP and AAA tracing to troubleshoot BI related problems in Controller - United States

Text:
RSVP trace AAA trace triple A tracing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer's Controller system has errors/problems when running BI-related functionality (typically when running 'standard reports' - also known as 'system reports'). 

Customer would like to send IBM Support some log files (RSVP_Audit.log, RSVP_Perf.log & AAAclient.log) which capture details of BI-related tasks that are occuring on the Report Server.

How can they create these log files, and where are the log files created? 

SYMPTOM
Typically the customer is trying to run 'Standard Reports' but is receiving error message(s).


CAUSE
NOTE: 

 * You can only enable one of these traces (RSVP or AAA) at a time.  * They cannot both be run simultaneously.
   
   
 * There is no need for any downtime (no need to restart server/services) so long as you are running recent/modern versions of the Controller product 
 * However, the log files can quickly use up hard drive space (and also cause slight slowdown of performance) and therefore it is recommended that you stop the logging as soon as you have finished capturing the information that you require.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
RSVP Logging: 

 1. Logon to the server which is running your Content Manager. TIP: If you only have more than one Controller-related server, then this is the server which runs the "IBM Cognos 8" Windows service 
 2. Open the '...\c8\configuration' folder . TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\configuration 
 3. Create a copy of the existing file "ipfRSVPclientconfig.xml.sample" and rename the copy to "ipfclientconfig.xml". In other words, you now have a new file "ipfclientconfig.xml" in addition to the original file "ipfRSVPclientconfig.xml.sample". 
 4. Open the folder "...c8\logs". TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\logs 
 5. After 30 to 60 seconds, check that the following two files have appeared in that folder: RSVP_Audit.log & RSVP_Perf.log


The files will initially be 0kb in size. However, they will grow as the users perform BI-related tasks (e.g. run Standard Reports). 

 

Once enough information has been captured (e.g. the end users have run the reports and got errors) then perform the following steps: 

 1. Open the '...\c8\configuration' folder . TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\configuration 
 2. Delete the file: ipfclientconfig.xml 
 3. Open the folder "...c8\logs". TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\logs 
 4. Move the files RSVP_Audit.log & RSVP_Perf.log to a sensible location, before sending them to IBM Support for analysis.


AAA Logging: 

TIP: The following instructions should work for most versions of Controller 8.x. However, if there are problems (or you need more information/detail) please refer to separate Technote #1343375. 

 1. Logon to the server which is running your Content Manager. TIP: If you only have more than one Controller-related server, then this is the server which runs the "IBM Cognos 8" Windows service 
 2. Open the '...\c8\configuration' folder . TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\configuration 
 3. Create a copy of the existing file "ipfaaaclientconfig.xml.sample" and rename the copy to "ipfclientconfig.xml". In other words, you now have a new file "ipfclientconfig.xml" in addition to the original file "ipfaaaclientconfig.xml.sample". 
 4. Open the folder "...c8\logs". TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\logs 
 5. After 30 to 60 seconds, check that the following file has appeared in that folder: AAAclient.log


Once enough information has been captured (e.g. the end users have run the reports and got errors) then perform the following steps: 

 1. Open the '...\c8\configuration' folder . TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\configuration 
 2. Delete the file: ipfclientconfig.xml 
 3. Open the folder "...c8\logs". TIP: By default, this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\cognos\c8\logs 
 4. Move the file AAAclient.log to a sensible location, before sending it to IBM Support for analysis.
