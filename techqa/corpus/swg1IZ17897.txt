APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Impact v4 when we configure an SNMP datasource to retrieve
   data items from an SNMP agent running on a remote host we get an
   error if the type for target agent is specified as TABLE.
   
   The error is either a timeout or a message like "OID not valid".
   
   This has been confirmed with various versions of Impact v4.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *

   Steps to replicate: 1) Confirgure SNMP DSA 2) Create a Data
   Type for syORTable ( or any other) 3) Create a policy using the
   Data Type created in step 2. use getbyfilter() to query it.
   NOTE you may use the SnmpTableTest canned policy within impact
   4) Run the policy and observe  the timeout exception
