ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  steps to replicate in 7114 with SRM:
   Calendar Timezone issue:
   Maximo Application Server and Database server time is in GMT
   timezone
   1. log in as Wilson, go to the default profile, set the timezone
   to US/Eastern for my profile
   2. Create a calendar called TESTSLAC in the calendar app with
   shift pattern as below:
   Shift = 8-5 EAST
   Start time = 8:00
   End time = 17:00
   Work hours =9:00
   
   3. create a new SLA
   applies to = INCIDENT
   offering = CUSTOMER
   Apply this calendar to an SLA
   i.e. in the Applies to Calendar section
   enter TESTSLAC
   shift = 8-5 EAST
   then in the Calculation Calendar
   enter TESTSLAC
   shift = 8-5 EAST
   
   commitment = 1005
   type = resolution
   value = 3.00
   unit of measure = DAYS
   
   set the status of this SLA to ACTIVE
   
   When I try to apply this SLA to an incident created at 1:05 pm
   eastern time, the SLA does not get applied. Get error message
   "BMXAA3946E - No Applicable SLA(s) found for this record."
   
   The reason being our server time is in GMT and it will be 6 PM
   according to server time. Since the SLA is defined until 5PM, it
   does not apply.
   
   We expect the SLA to be applied since the calendar was created
   in eastern timezone and the ticket was created at 1 PM which
   falls in the calendar.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  We currently have a workaround in place now. Offset the time by
   5 hours
   in calendar.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The Calendar and Shift tables do not contain a Time Zone.
   
   The Maximo framework has a feature that will translate any
   DATETIME field that is stored in the Maximo Server into the
   time zone of the Client PC that is displaying the data. It will
   also translate a DATETIME field that is entered on the Client
   PC into the Server's time zone when that record is stored in
   Maximo.  That explains why the Report Date, for example, on the
   Service Request is shown on the PC in Local Time, and is stored
   in the Maximo Database in Server time.
   
   Care must be taken, however, with calendars, as they are stored
   only in Server Time.  This is because the calendar and shift
   are a collection of work periods, and the work period table is
   defined using a DATE field, not a DATETIME field for each of
   the days in the work period.  Therefore, in order for a
   calendar to reflect local time, the user must use some
   arithmetic (or, in my case, a calculator).  Let's take the
   example of a user in Boston and a Server in London.  I am the
   user in Boston, and I want to create a calendar that represents
   daily work periods of 07:00 to 16:00.  I must enter these start
   and end times as 13:00 (8 + 5) and 21:00 (16 + 5), in order for
   them to be used to calculate targets for SR's in Boston (or NY,
   or Washington, or Miami).
