Title: IBM ODBC Administrator dialog does not open within Database Wizard of Statistics 18 on Windows Vista and Windows 7 32 and 64 bit - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with PASW Statistics 18 and would like to add a new datasource with the Add Datasource button on the Statistics Database wizard. However, when I click on this button nothing happens, why is this? When I do the same on Win XP with Statistics 18 I do not encounter this problem. This does also not happen when I log in as local administrator.

With the following steps you can reproduce the issue:

1. Launch Statistics 18
2. Go to File -> Open Database -> New Query
3. Click "Add ODBC Data source"

But, unfortunately nothing happens. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available. It is resolved with the PASW Statistics 18.0.3 Patch.
As a workaround please perform the Add Datasource in the ODBC Database Administrator within the Control Panel of your computer. We apologize for the inconvenience.
