zEDC WIN WIN=15 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the impact of the window (WIN) value when zEDC is being used? 

CAUSE
You are using zEDC for compression on the mainframe but the other nodes are not. The other nodes do not use zEDC or do not support zEDC.

ANSWER
The following conditions need to be enforced or will be forced when one node is using z/EDC and the other is not, regardless of the platform:


 * The decompress window (WIN) must be equal to or greater than the compress window (WIN). 
 * When Connect:Direct for z/OS (CDZ) is the receiver, it can unconditionally force the window (WIN) to the maximum of 15. And it has done that since ZLIB support started. 
 * When CDZ is the sender:  * When CDZ is the PNODE, it forces WIN=15 if ZEDC is ON (locally). 
      Starting in 5.2 at APAR PI46778 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI46778] it also sets a flag so both sides use WIN=15. 
    * When CDZ is the SNODE, it cannot force the PNODE to change its window (WIN) setting. It will not obey the request. CDZ must use the WIN setting as specified by the PNODE.
