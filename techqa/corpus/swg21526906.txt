QUESTION
 What is the maximum number of concurrent sessions that Connect:Direct VM can have? 

ANSWER


The maximum number is 24. In VM file access, each minidisk access is represented by a mode letter, A thru Z, or 26 of them. 

 

Concurrent sessions could probably never exceed 24 because Connect Direct ALWAYS requires an access to its VSAM minidisk, and also one for a default command and process library. 

 

Each COPY from or to a minidisk would require one. If a process performed only a RUN TASK or RUN JOB without reference to a minidisk, then in that case it might be able to exceed the 26 barrier. When VSAM is involved, it may take 2; one for the catalog and the other for the VSAM space. 

 

For a user to define more than this is just wasting storage space; they will never get used.
