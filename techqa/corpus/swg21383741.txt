QUESTION
 What is the difference between the IBM Tivoli Monitoring DB2 Agent and the DB2 monitoring agent shipped with DB2? 

ANSWER
DB2 monitoring agent bundled with DB2 - This is an agent shipped and supported by DB2. It does share code from IBM Tivoli Monitoring for DB2 Agent, however it is not to be used within a Tivoli infrastructure. The DB2 Agent shipped with DB2 bundles in a version of IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server 6.2 along with the agent. It does not ship Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server; it uses the DSAC console for the GUI and uses SOAP to get the data. The version of the agent is listed as "06.21.00.00". 

This agent is to be used within the DB2 DSAC environment. Support for this agent (DSAC) is handled through the DB2 support team, not ITM.


IBM Tivoli Monitoring DB2 Agent - This is the agent that should be installed if a customer wants to monitor DB2 within a Tivoli infrastructure. The DB2 agent versions in the field applicable to monitoring in a Tivoli infrastructure include from 6.2 to 7.1. 

Note: 7.1.1 is the latest version of DB2 Agent by Mar. 2018 when we update the technote, There might be higher version in the future.
