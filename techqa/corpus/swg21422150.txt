QUESTION
 Is WebSphere Application Server supported on POWER7 hardware? 

ANSWER
For the operating systems that are supported by WebSphere Application Server and POWER7 hardware, the minimum WebSphere Application Server fix pack levels for IBM POWER7 support are specified in the processor-mode columns within the following table.




WebSphere Application Server Version POWER7 processor in POWER6 compatibility mode POWER7 processor mode POWER7 mode with performance enhancements 8.0 8.0.0.0

This version contains IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition 6.0 (J9 2.6). 8.0.0.0

This version contains IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition 6.0 (J9 2.6). 8.0.0.0 

This version contains IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition 6.0 (J9 2.6). 7.0 7.0

This version contains Java Software Development Kit (SDK) 6 Service Release (SR) 2. 7.0

This version contains Java SDK 6 SR 2, which supports POWER7 toleration. 7.0 Fix Pack 9 or later

This version contains Java SDK 6 SR 7. 6.1 6.1 Fix Pack 9

This version contains Java SDK 5.0 SR 5. 6.1 Fix Pack 19

This version contains Java SDK 5.0 SR 8. See the important note that follows this table. Not applicable 6.0.2 6.0.2 Fix Pack 41

This version contains Java 1.4.2 SR 13 Fix Pack 4 for the SDK. 6.0.2 Fix Pack 41

This version contains Java 1.4.2 SR 13 Fix Pack 4 for the SDK. Not applicable 

Note: When you use the POWER7 processor mode and want to install WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 64-bit products, you must run the export JAVA_COMPILER=NONE command in your terminal session prior to running the ./install command or ./launchpad command in that same terminal session. This process is also applicable when you install the 64-bit Web Services Feature Pack or the 64-bit EJB 3.0 Feature Pack for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 products and use the POWER7 processor mode. If you do not run this export command first, the product installation panel does not display and a Java storage dump occurs. However, if you use a Customized Installation Package (CIP) to install WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 Fix Pack 19 or later, you do not need to run the export command. 


If you want to uninstall WebSphere Application Server 6.1 64-bit products, you must also run the export JAVA_COMPILER=NONE command in your terminal session prior to running the ./uninstall command in that same terminal session. Otherwise, a Java storage dump occurs if your system partition is using the default POWER7 processor mode. 


When you use the IBM Update Installer to install a fix pack for 64-bit WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 products on a system that is using the default POWER7 processor mode, you 
should run the export JAVA_COMPILER=NONE command in your terminal session prior to running the ./update.sh command in that same terminal session. Otherwise, an 'INSTCONFPARTIALSUCCESS' message may occur due to the following configuration action failure that will appear in the update log as: 


Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.installtoolkitbridge.ISMPInstallToolkitBridgeForNIFramework, wrn, Config action failed: 
runISCDeployRestore - /usr/WAS61/properties/version/nif/update/config/install/runISCDeployRestore.ant 


The same minimum fix pack levels apply to the IBM HTTP Server and the WebSphere Application Server plug-in products on POWER7 hardware.
