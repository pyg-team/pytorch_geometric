ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DEFINITION:
   
   In the following link:
   
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0]
   .2/com
   .ibm.sco.doc_2.4/ts/ts_setting_log_levels.html
   
   
   It states, for keystone:
   
   'To increase the logging level for the OpenStack Keystone
   component, edit the /etc/keystone/keystone.conf file on
   Central Server 2 and change level=WARNING to level=DEBUG in
   the [logger_keystone] section.
   After changing the logging level, you must restart the
   Keystone component by running the service openstack-keystone
   restart command.'
   
   The above is not quite correct, did not work as intended for
   the
   client.
   
   The keystone.conf does not have a [logger_keystone] section.
   Actually, the [logger_keystone] section is in the
   /etc/keystone/logging.conf.
   
   Furthermore, existing doc link misses these 2 entries which are
   located in the keystone.conf, [DEFAULT] section:
   verbose = true
   debug = true
   
   Please correct the documentation to reflect correct
   instructions, this needs to be done for all ICO versions (not
   only the 2.4.0.2 link provided as an example)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use [DEFAULT] section:
   verbose = true
   debug = true
   in /etc/keystone/keystone.conf
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of  IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4 FP1/Fp2 documentation
   and want to configure keystone debug tracing.
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4 FP1/FP2 documentation describe wrong
   way to enable the keystone component debug tracing.
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   Review the next update of SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.4 FP 3
   Information Center when available. The documentation changes can
   also be found in the conclusion section below.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ****************************************************************
   
   * PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   In chapter "IBM Cloud Orchestrator
   2.4.0.3>Troubleshooting>Setting logging levels" the following
   will be updated:
   
   To increase the logging level for the OpenStack Keystone
   component, edit the /etc/keystone/keystone.conf file on Central
   Server 2, and specify the following values in the [Default]
   section:
   
   verbose=true
   debug=true
