 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple Apache vulnerabilities affect IBM HTTP Server shipped with IBM Cloud Orchestrator and IBM Cloud Orchestrator Enterprise edition. IBM Cloud Orchestrator and IBM HTTP Server have addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-7679 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7679]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a buffer overread in mod_mime. By sending a specially crafted Content-Type response header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read one byte past the end of a buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-7668 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7668]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a buffer overread in the ap_find_token() function. By sending a specially crafted sequence of request headers, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-3167 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3167]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() function by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication requirements.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416] for the current score
