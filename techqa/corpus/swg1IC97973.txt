APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TIP version information reporting is inconsistent, resulting in
   additional requests for information from customer environments
   when troubleshooting TPC/TIP issues.  An example of this
   inconsistency:
   In the TPC 5.1.1.2 version.txt file, the following information
   about TIP is displayed:
   TPC V5.1.1.2 Build 20130918-1551
   TIP 2.2 Driver 12
   tip driver number 201302100416
   This does not match the TIP version information that's
   registered with the Deployment Engine (DE) component as shown
   when issuing queries directly to the DE - for example:
   <identityName>TIPCore</identityName>
   <version>2.2.0.9</version>
   The TPC version.txt file(s) should contain consistent component
   version information to aid in product serviceability, for cases
   when the TPC and TIP support teams need to collaborate to
   resolve a PMR.  Version information in this format which shows
   TIP fixpack level helps to more quickly identify appropriate
   fixes/patches for problems encountered.

LOCAL FIX
 *  To obtain valid/understandable TIP version information:
   Windows:
   cd "C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi"
   setenv.cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin"
   de_lsrootiu.cmd
   UNIX and Linux:
   . /var/ibm/common/acsi/setenv.sh
   cd /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin
   ./de_lsrootiu.sh
   Provide the resulting output to the support representative with
   TPC/TIP log collection.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Use steps in LOCAL FIX until fix maintenance is applied.     *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The version.txt file will contain another line that will specify
   the TIP version from the Deployment Engine.
