APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Allow-Compression Policy, in the user agent, contains
   an * (asterisk) in the the URL Matching Expression field, the
   compression works but transactions are not displayed in the
   Probe when the Probe is enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the Allow-Compression Policy, provide a specific URL matching
   expression instead of using an * (asterisk) in the the URL
   Matching Expression field.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the use of the Probe.
   
   
   If Allow-Compression-Policy enables compression by URL match
   expression matching "http://127.0.0.1:63504/" (e.g. "*" does),
   then the Probe does not record transaction data for the service,
   and "Debug:  Could not connect to debugger" is logged.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.13, 6.0.0.5 and 6.0.1.1.
