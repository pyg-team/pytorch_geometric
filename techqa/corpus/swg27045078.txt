ABSTRACT
 The Infrastructure Security support team discussed how XGS can help you control access to sites like Facebook using Passive Authentication and User Authentication Portal. After a presentation, attendees were given an opportunity to ask our panel of experts questions. Throughout the event, attendees were able to comment and ask questions in the IBM SmartCloud Meeting Web chat. 

CONTENT
In this Open Mic session we talked about the "who" and especially about "people". While who can be IP addresses or geolocation objects, it can also be people. The XGS appliance has the ability to recognize people with these two features: 

 * Passive Authentication 
 * User Authentication Portal


Our goal in Open Mics is to provide insight on how IBM Security Network Protection works and to teach on-going sessions that help users and administrators understand, maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with their XGS appliance. This Open Mic session was the fifth webcast provided by IBM Infrastructure Security Technical Support. 
 * Topic: Controlling Internet Access with XGS: A configuration walkthrough of user authentication 
 * New Date: Wednesday, March 4, 2015 
 * Time: 11:00 AM ET (16:00 UTC/GMT, UTC-5 hours) for 60 minutes
