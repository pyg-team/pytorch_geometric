SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile that are used by ClearQuest Web and ClearQuest EmailRelay. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

For ClearQuest 8.x 
These releases use an installation of WAS separately installed and maintained from the ClearQuest installation. Determine the version of WAS that your deployment is using and follow the instructions at Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with RSA Export Keys may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-0138) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613] to update your version of WebSphere Application Server. 

For ClearQuest 7.1.x 
These releases ship with, install and configure WAS version 6.1.0.25. Download the appropriate fix from from Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with RSA Export Keys may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-0138) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613] but for installation instructions, follow technote 1390803: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803] How to update the IBM WebSphere Application Server components in Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest 7.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803].
