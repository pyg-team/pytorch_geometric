Title: IBM DataPower terminates SSL connection after 60 seconds if no HTTP packets received after successful SSL handshake - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does DataPower terminate a SSL connection to a Multiprotocol Gateway or a Webservice Proxy if no HTTP data is received 60 seconds after the SSL handshake completes? 

CAUSE
There is a hardcoded HTTP timeout of 60 seconds for MPGWs and WSPs which will terminate the SSL connection if HTTP data is not received 60 seconds after the SSL handshake completes.

ANSWER
To avoid this timeout, one suggestion is to adjust the client to delay starting the SSL handshake to the point when it is actually ready to transfer the HTTP data. 

Another option, is to use a XML Firewall which has a configurable HTTP timeout (see advanced tab of the XML Firewall WebGUI configuration page).

Note: adjusting the frontside handler timeouts of the MPGW or WSP does not help.
The difference between the HTTP timeout and the Front side timeout is that the HTTP timeout starts right after the TCP handshake completes and at any later point that the client connection becomes idle.
The front side timeout starts only after the initial HTTP request has been received where the client connection becomes idle while waiting to receive the remainder of the request.
