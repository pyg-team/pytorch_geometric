ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Documentation for installing TSM reporting and monitoring in an
   existing ITM environment needs clarification
   Tivoli Storage Manager version 6.1 Installation Guide
   Chapter 5. Installing the Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and
   monitoring feature
   Planning to install the Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and
   monitoring feature
   Before installing the Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and
   monitoring feature, there are some decisions you must make.
   You have IBM Tivoli Monitoring currently installed on a server
   If you are currently using IBM Tivoli Monitoring, the Tivoli
   Storage Manager reporting and monitoring feature can be
   installed on your existing IBM Tivoli Monitoring server but
   the following requirements must be met:
       * The IBM Tivoli Monitoring server must be a fully licensed
         version of IBM Tivoli Monitoring
       * The IBM Tivoli Monitoring server must be at the 6.2
         FP1 level
   For this type of Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and monitoring
   installation, the IBM Tivoli Monitoring option would not be
   checked on the install wizard and the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
   server is identified when prompted by the installation script.
   The documentation should be updated to clearly state the
   following:
   To use the Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and monitoring
   feature in an existing IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) environment,
   the "Tivoli Storage Manager monitoring agent" should be
   installed on the ITM Server.
   
   Although a "Reporting Agent for Tivoli Storage manager" instance
   may not need to be configured on the ITM server, it is still
   necessary to install the "Tivoli Storage Manager monitoring
   agent" product in the existing ITM environment to operate the
   TSM Reporting and Monitoring feature.
   
   When installing the "Tivoli Storage Manager monitoring agent"
   product in an existing ITM environment, the current
   install directory should be specified during the install
   process. For example, if installing on AIX, and ITM is already
   installed in /opt/IBM/ITM, the same directory should be
   specified when the "Tivoli Storage Manager monitoring agent"
   is installed.
   
   When installing the "Tivoli Storage Manager monitoring agent",
   refer to apar IC61723 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC61723] to properly install the agent.
   
   TEMS and TEPS are automatically restarted when the "Tivoli
   Storage Manager monitoring agent" is installed in an existing
   ITM environment.
   
   Versions Affected:
   All versions of Tivoli Storage Manager reporting and monitoring
   feature
