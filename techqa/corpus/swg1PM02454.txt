ERROR DESCRIPTION

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 6 *
   *                 using SSL/TLS.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A channel failing due to a failure to   *
   *                      renegotiate the SSL/TLS secret key does *
   *                      not report the failure correctly. The   *
   *                      channel ends and issues CSQX620E        *
   *                      reporting a failure with RC=439         *
   *                      (Connection closed).                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A channel using SSL/TLS transmits more than SSLRKEYC bytes of
   data, and attempts to renegotiate the secret key however the
   renegotiation fails. MQ does not report the reason for the
   failure, and the channel terminates with the wrong return code
   (connection closed).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQXSSLF is changed to correctly report the reason for the
   renegotiation failure prior to the channel terminating.
