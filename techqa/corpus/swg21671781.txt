Title: IBM Upper and Lower case entries in Application User column - United States

Text:
app user name TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Entries in reports under "Application User" column are sometimes upper and sometimes lower case. This can cause a problem if the reports are configured to be sent to a SIEM that is expecting a consistent input. 

CAUSE
Uppercase is the expected format of this column. The inconsistency is caused by a defect that is resolved in GPU fixpacks after v9p200. If you are unable to upgrade, there is a work around available to solve the problem.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps to implement the work around. 

1. Create a Computed Attribute to convert the column to upper case. In the CLI run the following all on one line:


 * grdapi create_computed_attribute attributeLabel="Uppercase App User" entityLabel="Access Period" expression="UPPER(APP_USER_NAME)"


2. In the query builder in the GUI you will now have an extra field, "Uppercase App User" available under the Access Period entity. 

3. Replace the "Application User" with "Uppercase App User" in the queries that are affected.
