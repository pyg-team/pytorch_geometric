ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An XML Manager using multiple SSL Proxy Profiles for connections
   to the same IP address and port number, may result in SSL
   connections presenting the wrong certificate if 'Client-side
   Session Caching' is enabled.
   The connections may fail or cause other errors because each
   XML manager maintains the SSL session cache based on the IP
   address and port of the SSL connections.  Therefore,
   services using the same XML manager could use the wrong SSL
   credentials (certificates) when sending data to the same IP
   address and port.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One of the following options can be used to avoid this issue:
   1) Disable 'Client-side Session Caching' in the SSL Proxy
   Profile
   2) Assign a unique IP/port pair on the backend server for
   each SSL Proxy Profile.
   3) Use a distinct XML manager for each SSL PRoxy Profile by
   creating 'chained' servicing.  This would mean adding a service
   (e.g., XML Firewall) behind the current 'client-facing' service.
   The XMLFW would then use a single SSL Proxy Profile and its own
   unique XML manager to forward the request to the backend server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower customers using multiple SSL Proxy Profiles with
   mutual authentication to connect to a single IP/Port pair may
   experience issues when Client-side Session Caching is enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This will be fixed in a future major release.
