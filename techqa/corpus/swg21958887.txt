QUESTION
 Is there a means of configuring IBM TRIRIGA CAD Integrator so that the user passwords do not appear as clear text?

NOTE: The clear text concern is when the information is transmitted over the network. The password is not readable as the user enters it in the login dialog. 

CAUSE
By default, CAD Integrator (in fact all web technologies) will send the user password in clear text. In environments where security is a very strong concern, this is typically not permitted.

ANSWER
Implementing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) will cause traffic transmitted over the network (including passwords) to be encrypted allowing for the desired level of security. 

It is common for clients to use Single Sign On (SSO) and SSL together but it is possible to use just SSL if only password encryption is necessary.
