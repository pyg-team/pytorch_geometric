Title: IBM Invisible data in string variable - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using SPSS for Windows and I ran a Frequency on a long string variable and got an odd result. The output shows a counted value that I can't locate in my data. The variable in question contains open-ended response data, and is set to a width of 250. The Frequency table shows one entry of just a few nonsense characters. I did a visual inspection of the column and could not find the cell with this strange entry. If I do a "find" on the entry, I'm taken to what looks to me like a blank cell. If I clear the cell and re-run the Frequencies, the weird entry doesn't show up.

Any ideas? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Examine the field that the "find" took you to. Double-click in the cell to highlight the contents and drag your cursor all the way to the right (or left, depending on the field justification). It's possible that the information is there, just somehow placed "off-screen"
