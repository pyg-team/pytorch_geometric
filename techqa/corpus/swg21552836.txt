PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to send data to existing AS2 trading partner after trading partner has changed their IP Address 

SYMPTOM


Trading partner uses domain name in their end point URL and the IP Address for the domain name has changed.

For example:

domain name: www.sterlingcommerce.com

Old IP Address associated with sterlingcommerce is 123.123.123.123

After update, domain name remained the same and the new IP Address is now 234.234.234.234

Due to the trading partner's IP Address change, AS2 outbound no longer works.

Error Message NA

Error message can be seen in the perimeter.log (Perimeter Services when it is enabled)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


In this case, GIS/SI uses the Java Virtual machine where it caches the old IP Address of the domain name and thus sending data to trading partner's old IP Address.

The solution for immediate fix is to replace the domain name with the new IP Address in the trading partner's AS2 setup or restart GIS/SI in order for the Java virtual machine that GIS uses to clear its cache.

See [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21558028]article 1558028 (NFX10058) for instructions on how to permanently reset the cache timeout for DNS lookups.
