 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to run the production job from the menu using PASW Statistics 18.0.0 on Windows XP. I am able to run the job using the output format viewer .spv but other format is not working specially TEXT_CODEPAGE the one I want to use. Is this defect for this release? Is there a fix for it?

Here is the steps I did.
Open Dataset
running analysis such as Analyze\Freq
then click paste the syntax then saved it to desktop
Go to Utilities \ Production Job
Click on New and open the syntax I saved
Select output Viewer as TEXT_CODEPAGE
Run Job.
