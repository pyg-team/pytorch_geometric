APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the WCM Admin UI, in some cases (normally only when
   session replication or persistence is enabled) you may see a
   'com.ibm.workplace.wcm.app.ui.admin.library
   .LibraryResourcesModel$LibraryResource' is not serializable
   exception such as:
   
   [1/30/13 5:10:20:038 CET] 00000087 WASSession E
   SessionContextMBeanAdapter findAttCausingNotSerializableExceptio
   
   n Miscellaneous data: Attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B
   
   1020746_tm" is declared to be serializable but is found to
   generate exception "java.io.NotSerializableException" with
   message "com.ibm.workplace.wcm.app.ui.admin.library
   .LibraryResourcesModel$LibraryResource". Fix the application so
   that the attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B1020746_tm"
   is correctly serializable at runtime
   
   This defect is to handle the making of the
   'com.ibm.workplace.wcm.app.ui.admin.library
   .LibraryResourcesModel$LibraryResource' serializable so these
   errors don't occur.
   
   Opened for release 7002

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis: The class is question is referenced from within some
   of the WCM Admin UI Portlet Model classes which themselves are
   referenced by the WCL Trigger Manager (that is where the tm
   attribute comes from) is that being stored in the session for
   performance. Thus, the class in question should be made
   serializable.
   Solution: com.ibm.workplace.wcm.app.ui.admin.library
   .LibraryResourcesModel$LibraryResource was made serializable
