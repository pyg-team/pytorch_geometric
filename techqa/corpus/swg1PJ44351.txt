APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Content Platform Engine (CPE) becomes unavailable after changing
   Storage Area (SA) status from open to standby.
   
   CPE environments with over 100 storage areas take a while to
   update status.
   
   To workaround the issue, updates to SA status should be done
   during off hours with an increased transaction timeout.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * This issue may affect CPE users on version                   *
   * 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002 and higher (including 5.2.1 and 5.2.1 FP *
   * up to 5.2.1.5-P8CPE-FP005), when working with large number   *
   * of storage areas (like more than 100). the storage cache     *
   * rebuild may take some time to finish. During this time, the  *
   * incoming put/get content requests will be blocked and        *
   * serialized, makes CPE not responsive, and may even cause     *
   * AppServer crash and generate Java Core dump.                 *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.1.6-P8CPE-FP006 or higher.                    *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.6-P8CPE-FP006 and higher, the storage area cache
   rebuild will not block the incoming getContent/putContent
   requests and the requests processing will not blocking each
   other either.
