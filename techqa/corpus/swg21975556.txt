Title: IBM Community Metrics Reports Group By Geography Option Doesn't Show the Full Report - United States

PROBLEM
When a user runs the People/Participation report and groups it by "Geography", the results don't not show all the data. There is no option to scroll through the list of countries.

CAUSE
The community reports are static (generated and then cached on BI server) and have no interactive functionality like pagination for data lists. So by design all data items will be listed on page directly
without pagination. This issue is caused by the default page size of the report, which is 20, so only the top 20 items will display on the page.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following steps can be used as a workaround:

1) From a browser login to the Cognos BI server's admin page as the Cognos administrator.

2) Go to the following paths for IBM Cognos Connections:

Public Folders > IBMConnectionsMetrics > Metrics > community > peopleTheme

Public Folders > IBMConnectionsMetrics > Metrics > community > participationTheme

3) Find the reports named "people_attribute" and "participation_attribute"

4) For each report, click on "Set Properties" icon, go to the "Report" tab, click on "Advanced options". On the bottom of the page, change the "Number of rows per Web page in HTML reports" to 1000, then save the change.

4) Verify the change on Community Metrics page. Remember we have cached version reports, so choose a report in the community that has not recently visited (It's better choose the date range "last 7 days", since this report refreshes every day).
