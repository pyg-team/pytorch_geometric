 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Notes crashes intermittently with a Windows7 dialog box as illustrated in the following screen shot: 

 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21461830&amp;aid=1] 


ENVIRONMENT
Notes Standard 8.5.1 FixPack 1 

 Windows 7 Enterprise 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The NSD files that are generated are as follows: 

PANIC: Process notes2.exe (pid=####) no longer exists. A JVM fault could be responsible. 

WARNING (0): WCT Abnormal Termination Detected! Notes paniced because process notes2.exe (pid=####) was missing.
WARNING (0): The fatal thread reported will show only the panicing thread that detected that notes2.exe was missing. Searching for a javacore...
WARNING (0): Javacore file C:\Program Files\IBM\lotus\notes\data\workspace\logs\javacore.xxxx.xxxx.txt was found. Please review this file for further information on why notes2.exe abnormally terminated


This indicates that the Notes2 process is no longer present. It crashed and generated a javacore*.txt file that is located in the Notes\workspace\logs directory. This file must be reviewed for further troubleshooting. 

Checking the "top" of the generated javacore*.txt files, you find that the "Dump Event" is "gpf". General Protection Fault (gpf) means it's a crash.
