ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OS AIX
   Framework 4.1.1
   When scheduling a job one can't specify arguments to a job which
   are part of a task, that was created using TLL.
   
   Task that is created using TLL which takes 4 arguments, when
   runnning the task it prompts for the arguments, when you
   schedule that task as a job it doesn't prompt for those
   arguments.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Modify the Tivoli Scheduler so that it is possible to
   drag-and-drop a job into the scheduler and pop up a dialog
   that enables configuring parameters to the job, if the
   task to be executed by the job was installed via TLL.
   To enable this, execute the following shell commands:
     % SCHED=`wlookup -oa Scheduler`
     % idlattr -ta $SCHED dndconfig string ' "Enabled" '
   To disable this, execute the following shell command:
     % idlattr -ts $SCHED dndconfig string ' "Disabled" '
   To re-enable this, execute the following shell command:
     % idlattr -ts $SCHED dndconfig string ' "Enabled" '
   Each time a job is dragged-and-dropped into the scheduler,
   this attribute is checked. Thus, it can be turned on and
   off as needed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This will be fixed in patch 4.1.1-TMF-0104,
   which will be released in September, 2008.
