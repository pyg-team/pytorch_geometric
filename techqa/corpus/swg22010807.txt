Title: IBM Run process as different ID than api user. - United States

Text:
File Agent; permissions; API user; watch folder. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What permissions are needed

by the API user? 

SYMPTOM
File Agent API user has read, write, modify access
and that works just fine and others where it needs full control.


CAUSE
API user and system account user were different in customer environment.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2012

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The API user "A" and service account "B" are separate things with 
different requirements. Of course, is it possible - and often the case -
to use one account for both. Though the different requirements may 
provide a reason for some not to do so.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ID's however do not have to be the same but have to have the correct
permissions in place to work. 

You need to set the CDFA service to run under a custom CDFA service 
account. This is required as the the default local system account cannot
access remote servers or network shares. 
The minimum requirements for this CDFA service account are: 
- Log on as a service 
- Full access to the CDFA installation folder. 
- Read & List Folder Contents permission on the network share and all 
folders along the path. In addition, Modify permission is required when 
you optionally enable the rename logic (-Duserenamelogic=true).
