APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a permission to a page is changed by changing the role block
   or inheritance flag of a content node, this change is not
   reflected at the public content model.
   For example, an anonymous user has view permission on a page,
   because the inheritance flag has been set at the page and view
   permissions for anonymous users have been granted at the parent
   page. Now the inheritance flag is unset using the Manage Pages
   portlet.
   It is expected that the page disappears for anonymous users
   after a while (60 seconds on default, respectively the value of
   the WP ConfigService property public.page.reload).
   Actually, the page remains visible, until the Portal server
   gets restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart Portal Server after applying the changes.
