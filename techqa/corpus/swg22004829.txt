Title: IBM Problems initiating Process applets (e.g., Process Designer) after installing the Oracle April 2017 JRE quarterly update in the browser - United States

Text:
Java; JRE; applet FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 The Process applets (e.g., Process Designer, Process Administrator, Process Configuration Console, and Process Tracker) can no longer be initiated by ACCE, ICN, or ICM after the browser's JRE is updated to the Oracle April 2017 Java quarterly release. 

CONTENT
Oracle's April 2017 quarterly Java update treats jar files that are signed with the older MD5 algorithms as "unsigned." This makes those jar files generally unusable by applets. If a user updates the JRE used by their web browser to the Oracle April 2017 Java release, the Process applets will fail to initiate when that new JRE tries to load jars from older CPE releases. 
Both the CPE 5.2.1.4 (and earlier) releases and the CPE 5.2.0.4 (and earlier) releases contain jar files that were signed using MD5 algorithms. 

Using the latest Oracle JREs in a web browser to run applets requires using the more recent CPE releases so that all the jar files used by the applets are appropriately signed.

For CPE 5.2.0.x releases, the resolution is to upgrade up to a minimum release level of CPE 5.2.0.5, where all the jars are signed such that the new versions of Java are satisfied (See PJ44230 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PJ44230]). 

For CPE 5.2.1.x releases, the resolution is to upgrade to a minimum of CPE 5.2.1.5, where all the jars are signed such that the new versions of Java are satisfied (See PJ44230 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PJ44230]).

When the initiation of the applet fails, messages in the Java Console and/or in Java popups similar to the following are seen:

The following resource is signed with a weak signature algorithm MD5withRSA and is treated as unsigned: <server>:<port>/acce/peapps/download/applets_t.jar

or 

java.lang.SecurityException: attempted to open sandboxed jar http://<server>:<port>/acce/peapps/download/applets_t.jar as a Trusted-Library 

The jar file with the weak signature is often reported as applets_t.jar
but depending upon the age of the CPE release, the jar files mentioned may include any of the other jar files that the applets use. 


Although IBM recommends upgrading to a current Content Platform Engine release, two temporary workarounds exist: 

1. You can disable Java's "disabling of MD5" by editing the java.security file in the ...\java\jre\lib\security\ folder of the JRE being used by the web browser to run the applet(s) as described here:
https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html#disableMD5 [https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html#disableMD5]

2. You can install a slightly older version of Java on the client system for use in the web browser - one that does not disable the MD5 algorithm. Any Java older than the Oracle April 2017 Java Update will not disable MD5 and will let the applets on older CPE releases run. You can download an older JRE version using this link:
