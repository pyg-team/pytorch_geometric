 * PJ38372: Losing access to Administration Console when the metadata database is restarted 
 * PJ38242: Distributed flow optimization is incorrectly creating temp tables on the source databases. 
 * PJ38234: Generated SQL for remote sources uses as clause for table collation names which causes SQL errors for non-DB2 data sources. 
 * PJ38229: Control flow not terminated even when JCL operation failed. 
 * PJ38244: Commit count option for table target identifier has no impact on the generated data flows. 
 * PJ38215: When < > characters appear in the message field of log records, it will fail to view the log records in the instance/control flow management page.

 * PJ38277: JVM arg -Dset_current_refresh_age="no" has no impact 
 * PJ38283: Virtual Cube - mdx queries on warm cache still submitting sql 
 * PJ38284: VirtualSecurityManager shouldn't need to check if security should be applied to sets, tuples, or members if both the base cubes have no security managers and user has cube access to both base cubes 
 * PJ38296: If an exception occurs validating calculated members, an NPE masks the original exception in the log. 
 * PJ38308: Change CalculationEngine to use TupleLists to determine the base and calculatedMembers sets when populating base and calculated sets

The following known issues exist in Version 9.7.3. 

Installation and migration: 

The information center is missing the following instructions on ensuring that schedules were migrated successfully after applying an InfoSphere Warehouse fix pack. 

Problem: The following instructions are missing from the installation information in the InfoSphere Warehouse 9.7.3 information center: 

If you upgrade your installation of InfoSphere Warehouse V9.7 to the latest fix pack, such as Version 9.7.3, and you have schedules running in the Administration Console, the schedules might not work as you expect after the upgrade. To ensure that they work correctly, you must take steps before and after the upgrade. 

Before upgrading to a new fix pack, follow these steps: 

 1. In the InfoSphere Warehouse administration console, go to the SQL Warehousing tab and disable all schedules. 
 2. In WebSphere Application Server, disable the IBMDataToolsWeb application, then shut down WebSphere Application Server. 
 3. Shut down your DB2 server. 
    

Now install the fix pack. After the upgrade, take the following steps to ensure that your schedules are migrated and running successfully. Do not access Administration Console until these steps are completed: 
 1. WebSphere Application Server is started automatically after a successful upgrade. Check the WebSphere logs to ensure that it was started. 
 2. Start the DB2 server. 
 3. Clean up the WebSphere Application Server and IBMDataToolsWeb application temporary folders:  * C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\temp\<WebSphere node>\server1\IBMDataToolsWeb 
     * C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\temp\wscache\IBMDataToolsWeb 
     * C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\wstemp 
    
    
 4. Clear your browser cache. 
 5. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, verify that the IBMDataToolsWeb application was started. 
 6. Start the InfoSphere Warehouse administration console and ensure that all of your database connections, applications, schedules, and other configurations were migrated correctly. 
 7. Re-enable the schedules that you want to run, and verify that they run correctly.
