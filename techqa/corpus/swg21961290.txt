Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL including Logjam affect IBM MQ Light (CVE-2015-1788, CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on June 11, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol (CVE-2015-4000). OpenSSL is used by IBM MQ Light. IBM MQ Light has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-1788 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1788]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing an ECParameters structure over a specially crafted binary polynomial field. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103778 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103778] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2015-1789 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1789]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted certificate or CRL to trigger a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The vulnerabilities affect users of the mqlight [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqlight] IBM MQ Light Client Module for Node.jsÂ® on all platforms at the following versions:
1.0.2014090800
1.0.2014090801
1.0.2014091000-red
1.0.2014091001

It also affects users of the mqlight-dev [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqlight-dev] IBM MQ Light Client Module for Node.js between versions 1.0.2014090300 and 1.0.2014111002 inclusive.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Users of the IBM MQ Light Client Module for Node.js at an affected version should update to the latest version of the IBM MQ Light Client Module for Node.js as found on https://www.npmjs.com [https://www.npmjs.com/].

For CVE-2015-4000: You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. This includes the Node.js runtime environment.
