APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM InfoSphere Data Architect allows to specify default values
   for columns of CHAR datatype (CHAR, VARCHAR, etc.) as a
   character literal or as a character literal enclosed in quotes.
   Despite CHAR columns' default values get automatically enclosed
   in quotes during DDL generation, specifying default value as a
   character literal without quotes may cause subsequent comparison
   against the source database to report this literal to differ
   from correspondent literal in underlying database which is
   always enclosed in quotes.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enclose CHAR columns' default values in quotes.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * InfoSphere Data Architect considers a character N in a       *
   * Physical Data Model created from forward engineering and a   *
   * character 'N' in a Physical Data Model created from Reverse  *
   * Engineering as a difference. This comes up as InfoSphere     *
   * Data Architect tends to add quotes around the character N    *
   * during Reverse Engineering.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
