 US English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITCAM DC is connected to the Managing Server, but does not appear to be connected to the TEMA. The ITCAM agent is online in the TEP, but the JVM does not appear under it in the navigation tree. There are no workspaces. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to expand ITCAM WebSphere navigator in TEP. The JVM does not appear under the navigator tree. 


CAUSE
The Data Collector MBeans that are required for the TEMA are not loading correctly due to permission issue. Look at the following directory and make sure the "read" permission is present for toolkit_config_kwj.xml (and also other files.) Ensure the owner and group that is for the Websphere process is the same for the below files as well. 

 
/opt/candle/itcam/WebSphere/DC/itcamdc/etc: 
toolkit_config_ctg.xml 
toolkit_config_ims.xml 
toolkit_config_jdo.xml 
toolkit_config_kwj.xml 
toolkit_config_mqi.xml 
toolkit_config_ra.xml 
toolkit_custom.properties 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check Permission's as well as owner/group for file: 

/opt/candle/itcam/WebSphere/DC/itcamdc/etc/tookit_config_kwj.xml 

to make sure the owner/group is same as WebSphere. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Changed owner/group for all files and directories to match the owner and group for the WebSphere Process.
