 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The description of the http.nonPorxyHosts custom
   property in the topic entitled ?HTTP transport custom
   properties for Web services applications? in the information
   center for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0.2, Version
   6.1, and Version 7.0 does not adequately describe how to
   specify the values for the custom property using wildcards.
   Not specifying the values for the property correctly, using
   wildcards, can result in unexpected results.

   ****************************************************************
   The explanation of how to use wildcards in specifying the
   http.nonProxyHosts custom property, that is included in
   the topic ?HTTP transport custom properties for Web services
   applications? in the information center for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.0.2, Version 6.1, or Version 7.0
   is incomplete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ?HTTP transport custom properties for Web services
   applications? topic in The information center for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.0.2, Version 6.1, or Version 7.0
   will be updated to add a note clarifying how to use wildcards
   in specifying the http.nonProxyHosts custom property. The
   current text is below, followed by the new note.
   
   In the following example,
   
   http.proxyHost="myproxy.mycompany.com"
   http.nonProxyHosts="host1.company1.com|host*.company2.com|*.comp
   any3.com"
   
   all requests will be routed through the proxy server,
   myproxy.mycompany.com, except for the HTTP requests destined
   for the following hosts:
   
   o a single host named host1.company1.com
   o any host in the company2.com domain whose name starts
           with host
   o any host in the company3.com domain
   
   Note: Processing the settings for http.nonProxyHosts is
   performed as pure pattern matching. Host names are not
   expanded to their fully-qualified form before being matched to
   the pattern. For example, with http.nonProxyHosts specified in
   the above example, the string host1 will not match any of the
   settings specified, and as such, the Web services engine will
   send the request through the proxy server. In order for the
   host1 request to not be sent through the proxy server, the
   http.nonProxyHosts specification would have to include host1
   somewhere in the specification. An illustration of this
   specification follows.
   
   http.nonProxyHosts="host1.company1.com|host*.company2.com|*.comp
   any3.com|host1"
