QUESTION
 How do I use the IBM Packaging Utility to manage a Netcool/OMNIbus repository for IBM Installation Manager? 

ANSWER
Overview of IBM Packaging Utility
IBM Packaging Utility is a partner utility to IBM Installation Manager. While Installation Manager can install, uninstalls, and maintains applications from their installation repositories, Packaging Utility is used to manage the installation repositories themselves.

Netcool/OMNIbus core repositories
The Netcool/OMNIbus core repositories for Installation Manager are available to entitled users that use the Installation Manager or Packaging Utility applications to install directly from the IBM website or to copy the repository to a local file system respectively. The repositories are also available as zip files downloadable from IBM Fix Central. Whichever method is used to access the files, the Netcool/OMNIbus install repositories are all platform-sliced repositories. This means that they were created by the IBM Packaging Utility application with the -platform parameter set.

Packaging Utility and platform-sliced repositories
The Packaging Utility graphical user interface (GUI) does not currently support working with platform-sliced repositories. To work with platform-sliced repositories, use the Packaging Utility's command-line interface (pucl) with the -platform switch.


Locations for the Packaging Utility command-line application
Windows: <install location>\IBM\Packaging Utility\PUCL.exe
Unix/Linux: <install location>/IBM/PackagingUtility/PUCL

Copying a repository from Passport AdvantageÂ® to a local repository
The following command shows how to copy the Netcool/OMNIbus core repository from Passport Advantage to a local repository.

PUCL copy com.ibm.tivoli.omnibus.core -connectPassportAdvantage -platform os=<operating_system>,arch=<architecture> -target <repository_destination> 
-prompt -showProgress -acceptLicense

Valid combinations for the -platform argument are in following table. 

Platform Options Resulting Repository Windows os=win32,arch=x86
os=win32,arch=x86_64 Windows 32 bit Linux os=linux,arch=x86
os=linux,arch=x86_64 Linux 64 bit zLinux os=linux,arch=s390
os=linux,arch=s390x ZLinux 64 bit AIX os=aix,arch=ppc
os=aix,arch=ppc64 AIX 64 bit Solaris os=solaris,arch=sparc
os=solaris,arch=sparc64 Solaris 64 
Example to create a Windows repository in C:\OMNIbus_8.1: 
PUCL copy com.ibm.tivoli.omnibus.core -connectPassportAdvantage -platform os=win32,arch=x86_64 -target C:\OMNIbus_8.1 -prompt -showProgress -acceptLicense 

During the download from Passport Advantage, you are prompted for your user name and password to confirm your entitlement to the Netcool/OMNIbus product. 


Copying an existing local repository 
If you want to copy an existing local Netcool/OMNIbus repository and are unsure which platform combination was used to create the original repository, the following Packaging Utility command shows the available platform combinations. 
PUCL listAvailablePackages -repositories <repository_location> -showPlatforms 

Where the <repository_location> is the path to the repository.config file in the repository. 
Example: 
PUCL listAvailablePackages -repositories C:\OMNIbus_8.1 -showPlatforms
