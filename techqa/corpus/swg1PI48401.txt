LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The CICS documentation requires updating to clarify the upgrade
   strategy for the shared data servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CICS TS 5.2 "Upgrading from CICS TS Version 3.1" manual
   (GC34-7296-00) will be updated as follows.
     A new chapter will be added to the end of Part 2 (Upgrading
   CICS Transaction Server). Subsequent chapter numbers will
   be incremented accordingly:
   .
   "Chapter 38.  Upgrade considerations for CICS shared data
                 servers.
   .
   As you do for CICS, you should also periodically upgrade the
   three servers (temporary storage  data sharing, coupling
   facility data tables, and, named counters). Here are some
   important factors to consider before you perform these
   upgrades.
   .
   In most situations you should upgrade the servers before you
   upgrade the clients. This also applies to the CICS data sharing
   servers. As a result, a new server should always support old
   clients in a fully compatible way, including mixtures of
   client levels.
   .
   Although upgrades are not a requirement if no functional
   changes have been made in the new release of the product, it is
   still recommended that you upgrade the shared data server to
   the new release. When you have upgraded the shared data servers,
   CICS can then be upgraded as a client of the servers."
   .
   The same update will be made to:
     The CICS TS 5.2 "Upgrading from CICS TS Version 3.2" manual
   (GC34-7297-00), adding new Chapter 35;
     The CICS TS 5.2 "Upgrading from CICS TS Version 4.1" manual
   (GC34-7298-00), adding new Chapter 34;
     The CICS TS 5.2 "Upgrading from CICS TS Version 4.2" manual
   (GC34-7299-00), adding new Chapter 31;
     The CICS TS 5.2 "Upgrading from CICS TS Version 5.1" manual
   (GC34-7300-00), adding new Chapter 31.
