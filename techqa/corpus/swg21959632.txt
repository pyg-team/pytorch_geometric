PSIRT; DHE; DH; Diffie; Hellman; Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control; CVE-2015-4000 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control version 8.2.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 
Server
1. On the Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control server log on as an administrator or root. 
2. At a command window go to server installation directory, and run the following command:

Unix based systems:
bin/wsadmin.sh -c '$AdminTask modifySSLConfig {-alias NodeDefaultSSLSettings -enabledCiphers {SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA}}'

Windows based systems:
bin\wsadmin.bat -c "$AdminTask modifySSLConfig {-alias NodeDefaultSSLSettings -enabledCiphers {SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA}}" 

DHE/EDH ciphers are removed from the cipher list and the server is left with only RSA AES 128 and RSA 3DES. ECDHE ciphers and TLSv1.2 is not available in this version. 


Broker:
1. Edit the trc_broker.properties file and add !DH to the cipher list.

Windows operating system
\ProgramData\IBM\Tivoli\Remote Control\Broker\trc_broker.properties

Linux operating system
/etc/trc_broker.properties

If no cipher lists are currently defined in the configuration file, add the following three lines:

ServerCipherList = ALL\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!RC4\:\!EXP\:\!DES\:\!DH\:@STRENGTH [https://jazz412.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/users/STRENGTH#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=4446]
DefaultTLSCipherList = ALL+AES+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!MD5\:\!RC4\:\!DH\:@STRENGTH [https://jazz412.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/users/STRENGTH#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=4446]
DefaultHTTPSCipherList = ALL\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!RC4\:\!EXP\:\!DES\:\!DH\:@STRENGTH [https://jazz412.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/users/STRENGTH#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=4446]



If you already have cipher lists defined, add \!DH\: to the end of the list before the @STRENGTH [https://jazz412.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/users/STRENGTH#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=4446].
Check ServerCipherList, TLSCipherList, as well as any TLSCipherList properties that are defined as part of a connection. 

For example.
DefaultHTTPSCipherList = ALL\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!RC4\:\!EXP\:\!DES\:\!DH\:@STRENGTH [https://jazz412.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/users/STRENGTH#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=4446]

2. Restart the broker service.

Using !DH disables both DH and DHE/EDH ciphers in OpenSSL. ECDHE ciphers are not affected as they are considered safe and not affected by this vulnerability.
