ambiguous linkage; BXM; entity manager TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Customer run BXM and noticed one record didn't autolink to any other records and stayed in a singleton entity. However, when the same records go through entity manager, it linked with other records. Why? 

CAUSE
The BXM works differently with online entity manager. 

ANSWER
The BXM works differently with online entity manager. For example, there is one scenario called 'ambiguous linkage'. This means linkages with members that contain rules or same source autolinks with this is set to N. If the ambiguous linkage happened during BXM, it will create a task to let data steward to decide which entity should this record to be linked to. If it happens in online entity manager, it will autolink the record to the largest entity if it can link to 2 or more other entities. Then there is some sort of tie breaker in case both entities have same number of members, for example it links to the one that has the oldest member(the one with the lowest caudrecno).
