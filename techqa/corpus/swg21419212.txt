Title: IBM Microsoft Office 2007/2010 MIME Type Support in P8 Content Engine 3.5.2 - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which P8 Content Engine fix packs support Microsoft Office 2007/2010 long MIME types? 

CAUSE
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types identify the data format of a computer file, and are commonly used to tell the operating system what program to use to open a given file. Traditionally these have been very short text descriptions such as "text/plain," or "message/rfc822". 
With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft chose unusually long MIME types for certain file types, such as "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" for a Word 2007 document. These types are several times longer than traditional MIME types, and exceed the maximum allowed length in many applications, including P8 Content Engine 3.5.2.


ANSWER
Prior to patch P8CE-3.5.2-008, the maximum MIME type length supported was 64 characters. This was increased to 96 characters through an internal translation since the database still only supports 64 characters. P8CE-4.x supports 96 characters so this is not an issue there. 


P8CE3.5.2-008 and higher support Microsoft Office 2007 Word documents (.docx), Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx), and PowerPoint presentations (.pptx). 

It was later discovered that certain special operations like import/export and CFS-IS federation were still failing on MIME types longer than 64. This was addressed in the P8CE-3.5.2-019 fix pack.

Support for some of the less common Office 2007 file types like Excel and Word templates and PowerPoint slideshows (as opposed to presentations) and individual slide files was added in the P8CE-3.5.2-021 fix pack.

For details on how this affects searches using the FileNet OLE DB provider, and a full list of the Office 2007 MIME types that exceed 64 characters, see note 1416394.
