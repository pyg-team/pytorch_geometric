PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Follow the steps to install the GIM client on the Guardium system with the S-TAP already installed and without rebooting the server. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Download and execute BUNDLE-GIM shell installer (or the Windows Native Installer) on the database server without any options or parameters. GIM installation does not require server reboot. 

2. Download BUNDLE-STAP from Fixcentral. Upload to the Guardium appliance and then schedule installation. If this BUNDLE matches the revision number that was previously installed on the server, reboot will not be required and this STAP version is now fully managed by GIM. 

 

If revision is not exactly matched, system will prompt for a reboot and after reboot; the newer S-TAP/KTAP is installed and managed by GIM. 

 

Note: In step 2, the user must use the EXACT version and revision number of S-TAP software to avoid reboot requirements. If the user has older or different revisions on the database servers, we recommend adding a step before step 2 to install the latest S-TAP version on all the database hosts. For v9 and above upgrade S-TAP/KTAP without reboot by running the most recent shell installer script as if it was a new install. See Guardium guard-stap-update error [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21995965] for more details. 

S-TAP/KTAP prior to v9 may be upgraded to v9 without a reboot using the "guard-stap-update" utility.
