PROBLEM
Issue after updating custom theme war file in WAS

SYMPTOM
If you have created a custom theme file based on the 7.0.0.2 theme
and it works fine when installed initially, you may see an issue where does not work
after updating it. The problem is resolved by restarting the Theme_Modules application in WAS. The following errors are seen in the SystemOut.log:

Exception:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException SourceId:class
com.ibm.wkplc.extensionregistry.ExtensionClassLoader.loadClass ProbeId:1
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
com.ibm.wps.module.layout.LayoutRenderingDataSourceFactoryProxy

CAUSE
The reason is that the plugin.xml of the custom war and the plugin.xml of the 7.0.0.2 theme is linking the two applications together.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to remove the plugin.xml file from the custom theme. You also need to stop the custom theme war before you update the war file.
