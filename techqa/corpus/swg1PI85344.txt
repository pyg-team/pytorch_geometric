APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Installation and Configuration guide for the IBM SPSS
   Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS) 8.1 repository,  an
   example on the permissions needed to install C&DS on an Oracle
   database is provided. In this example, Oracle 11gR2 was used.
   This is very misleading as IBM SPSS C&DS 8.1 only support Oracle
   12c as a repository database.
   
   See KC article -
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS69YH_8.1.0/cads_co
   nfig_ddita/model_management/thin/database_permissions.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS69YH_8.1.0/cads_config_ddita/model_management/thin/database_permissions.html]
   
   =====================
   Example: Oracle 11gR2
   
   The following permissions are required for configuring IBM SPSS
   Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository with Oracle
   11gR2 database:
   
       CREATE SESSION
       ALTER SESSION
       CREATE TYPE
       CREATE TABLE
       CREATE PROCEDURE
       CREATE VIEW
       CREATE TRIGGER
   
   The following permissions are required for starting IBM SPSS
   Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository with Oracle
   11gR2 database:
   
       CREATE SESSION
       ALTER SESSION
       SESSIONS_PER USER - must be set to value equal to, or
   greater than, 100.
   =====================
   
   
   This is also reflected in the Compatibility Reports where Oracle
   11gR2 is listed as a supported database:
   
   https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-repor
   ts/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=FA7B4930C1D4 [https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=FA7B4930C1D4]

   optionalCapIds=7|22|65|72|186|26
   
   =====================
   Prequisite: Oracle Database 11g Enterprise Edition
   Version: Release 2 and future fix packs
   Prequisite Minimum: Release 2
   =====================
   
   
   Any attempts to install C&DS 8.1 on an Oracle 11gR2 database
   will fail with the following messages:
   =====================
   ERROR 1:
   Database version 11.2.0.4.0 does not meet minimum requirements!
   
   ERROR 2:
   Acceptable values: oracle
   Required:
   Range:
       Minimum: 12.1
   =====================
   
   
   The SPSS C&DS 8.1 documentation should not use Oracle 11gR2 as
   an example as it is misleading and can cause customers to think
   that this is a supported version of Oracle for our repository.
   
   Compatibility Reports should also be updated to remove Oracle
   11gR2 as a supported database version for our repository.
   
   
   To reproduce:
   Attempt to install C&DS 8.1 on an Oracle 11gR2 database and
   observe the reported error message.
   Attempt to install C&DS 8.1 on an Oracle 12c database and no
   errors occur.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If using Oracle as your repository database for IBM SPSS C&DS
   8.1, please make sure it is up to version 12.1 (12c) to be
   compatible.
