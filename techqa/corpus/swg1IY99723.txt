PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker with   *
   *                 JMS input nodes or                           *
   *                 Java User Defined input nodes                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The execution group abends after        *
   *                      restarting a flow that contains         *
   *                      either a JMS input node or a            *
   *                      Java User Defined input node.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem occurs when a JMS or a Java based User defined
   input node is frequently restarted. The execution will
   abend and restart.
   The frequency at which this happens is randomn and depends
   on how the operating system re-uses thread numbers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to clean up a thread context object
   that was not deleted when a thread ends.
