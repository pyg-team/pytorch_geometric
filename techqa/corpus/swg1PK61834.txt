APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PK58874 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK58874] addressed some portion of this issue but only when the
   user / author selects the option "Add image to library with
   anonymous access".  If the author does not select that option
   the original issue persists the local path to the image is added
   to the Rich Text Element and the image is not uploaded.
   ..
   To recreate the customer accesses their portal via TAM and then
   creates content with a Rich Text Element.  In the Rich Text
   Editor he or she performs the following:
     (1) select the insert image icon
     (2) select 'file system image'
     (3) browse to path of file
     (4) leave 'add image to library with . . ." unchecked.
     (5) click okay.
   ..
   The result should be the image is added to the Rich Text Element
   and therefore when accessed via other systems by other users the
   image is displayed (it is stored in the db).  The result is the
   local path is added to the RTE and nothing more even after save.
   ..
   Like PK58874 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK58874] bypassing TAM results in the expected behavior.
   No errors are associated with this issue.
   ..
   The html view of the RTE simply shows:
   <p>This is a test image:</p><p><img alt=" "src="file:
   ///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/rking/My%20Documents/RBNA/
   DMock-up/images/pic1.jpg"
    border="0"></p>
   ..
   The same behavior can be created when not using TAM to access
   portal/wcm if you remove the image from the path prior to the
   save of the content.  In that case a local path is also saved.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None
   ..
   Apply PK58874 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK58874] and use the option to add the image to the library
