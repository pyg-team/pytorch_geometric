APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DataPower appliance shows higher than expected latency
   connecting to IPv4 addresses resolved via DNS that might
   be caused by slow IPv6 DNS server responses.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are Datapower configurations using DNS resolution in
   environments where responses to IPv6 address (AAAA) queries have
   higher latency than responses to IPv4 address (A) queries. This
   is a common situation in many corporate networks that do not use
   IPv6.
   
   Datapower queries both A and AAAA DNS records whenever it is
   resolving a DNS name, waiting for both responses to come
   back (or time out). Thus the latency of a DNS query from
   Datapower is determined by the slower of both responses,
   regardless of the actual need for IPv6 address.
   
   The fix introduces a new control in DNS settings: "Force IP
   Preference", that can be used to restrict the DNS query to the
   preferred address family, avoiding the latency of querying the
   alternate address. By default, the feature is off to preserve
   compatibility with earlier releases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 7.2.0.0.
