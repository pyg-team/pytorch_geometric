APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Process Admin Console Process Inspector tab does not display
   process instances unless there is at least one task created. In
    some cases, where the process execution is waiting for a timer
   or message event, there may not yet be any tasks created.
   Additionally, if the "Delete task upon completion" option is in
   use for all tasks in a process instance, this will result in the
    same problem.
   
   For 8501, the fix can cause some regressions that are addressed
   in JR49363 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR49363]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a process instance does not contain at least one task, it
   will not be visible in the Process Inspector tab in the Process
   Admin Console. This also applies to failed instances.
   
   This situation can occur if, for example, the process definition
   begins with an intermediate timer or message event that is
   pending or the process definition consists only of Script tasks
   that do not result in the creation of corresponding task
   instances.
   
   This situation can also occur if your process completed and all
   tasks are configured to use the "Delete task upon completion"
   option.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   LOCAL FIX
   To ensure that process instances are always visible in the
   Process Inspector, add a system task to the beginning of each
   process flow, thus ensuring that at least one task instance
   always exists. Consider this approach as a temporary measure
   because it clutters the process definition and adds unnecessary
   data to the database.
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 that introduces a new
   custom property. This custom property includes process instances
    that do not contain any tasks. When this custom property is
   enabled, Process Inspector includes process instances that do
   not contain any tasks in search results. As a consequence, the
   process summary information (for example, "1 open tasks, 1
   completed tasks") is no longer available.

   After you apply interim fix JR51636, add a new
   taskless-bpd-support configuration flag in the 100Custom.xml
   file:
   
   <server>
           <process-inspector merge="mergeChildren">
               <taskless-bpd-support
   merge="replace">true</taskless-bpd-support>
           </process-inspector>
   </server>
