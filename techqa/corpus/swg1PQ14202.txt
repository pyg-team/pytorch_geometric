APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If CICS is shutdown on the last day of a leap year (ie day 366)
   and Warm started on day 1 of the next year, the ICEXTOD value is
   not adjusted, due to midnight, for any ICEs. The ICEs therefore
   fail to expire and so Transactions are not started.

   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS/VSE R230 users.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ICEs expire late if CICS is shut down   *
   *                      in a Leap Year, and warm started in     *
   *                      the following year.                     *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During the warm start of a CICS system, the adjustment of the
   expiry times of Interval Control Elements (ICEs) will be
   incorrect if the end of a leap year has passed since CICS was
   shut down. The extra day in the leap year is not included in
   the calculation of the number of days elapsed, so the ICEs will
   expire 24 hours late.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSII1 has been changed to test if CICS was shut down during
   a leap year, and to alter the expiry time of outstanding ICEs
   accordingly.
