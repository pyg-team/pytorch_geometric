APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DB2 Administration Tool for z/OS' GEN function when issued
   against the DSNDB06 database creates DDL for a MQT which
   referenced SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1 however the DDL for the tablespace
   used by the MQT is not created.
   This causes the Catalog Copy function to fail
   with a SQLCODEN204 / SQLCODE -204.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the DB2 Administration Tool for     *
   *                 z/OS who use the Catalog Copy function to    *
   *                 copy system objects in database DSNDB06      *
   *                 and use the Generate (GEN) line command to   *
   *                 generate DDL for system objects in           *
   *                 database DSNDB06.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The GEN function when issued against    *
   *                      database DSNDB06 creates DDL for a      *
   *                      Materialized Query Table (MQT) which    *
   *                      referenced SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1, however    *
   *                      the DDL for the tablespace used by      *
   *                      the MQT is not created.  This causes    *
   *                      the Catalog Copy function to fail       *
   *                      with a SQLCODEN204 / SQLCODE= -204      *
   *                                                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Program does not prevent the generation of DDL for non-system
   objects in database DSNDB06.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem has been resolved so that Catalog Copy will prevent the
   generation of non-system objects in database DSNDB06 e.g:
   MQT's that rely on system objects in database DSNDB06.
