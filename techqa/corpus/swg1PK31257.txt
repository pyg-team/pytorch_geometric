ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description from the customer:
   We don't have the steps to reproduce this, but we have at least
   10 different Production tickets on these.
   The primary symptom is that when the user views the Workflow att
   achment, the Name field contains someone else's ID.
   Also, these Emails alerts are sent daily to the Users.
   This is happening on GWA PMOR1, PMOR2, and PMOR3.
   Please contact Richard Jiang for samples of these Email Alerts.
   
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The problem is repeating on daily basis for many users.
   Freddy has helped us on examining a couple of workflow.pmo attac
   hments and couldn't locate any problem on the client-side and th
   e user.pmd.
   The problem, in my opinion, should be on the server side where t
   he contents of the workflow.pmos are generated.

   I couldn't see anything wrong  in either database code or alert
   system code.
   I have checked the customer's database and I have found out that
    there are 13734 resources which has same e-mails.
   Run this query to check how many resources have same e-mail
   SELECT count(*)  FROM RESOURCES T1, RESOURCES T2  WHERE T1.E_MAI
   L_ADDRESS = T2.E_MAIL_ADDRESS AND T1.RESOURCE_ID ?? T2.RESOURCE_
   ID

   I still don't know the real cause of the problem, but in PMOR2,
   there are lot of resources which has duplicate e-mails.  I have
   sent the following e-mail to Debra to check if there is any othe
   r resource in PMOR1 that uses Debra's e-mail, but the query retu
   rns no result.
   I have asked Petroula if  it would be possible for her  to get t
   he latest data of PMOR1 with the alert data not deleted(let them
    enable the alert after you copy the data).  This will enable me
    to debug the alert code dynamically and determine whether the c
   ause of the problem is either mis- configuration of the alert,
   data corruption, database code, or the alert code.
   SELECT t2.resource_id,  t2.logon_name, t2.e_mail_address FROM re
   sources t1, resources t2  WHERE t1.e_mail_address = t2.e_mail_ad
   dress AND t1.resource_id ?? t2.resource_id AND t2.e_mail_address

   I have rechecked with Petroula, and She is telling me The IBM su
   pport person of RPM ,Debra Muccio, has put a request to their DB
   A on Dec 14, 2005 to get the data for us.
   I will start working on the defect as soon as I receive the data
    from the support.

   We fixed one scenario (described in defect #41396). Since we don
   't have steps to reproduce this issue, I hope the fix for 41396
   will cover this one.
