APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OpenStack is designed to power off any VM which is
   listed as powered off via it's database, if a VM is
   powered on OUTSIDE the Openstack interface the next
   sync state will find the VM in an incorrect state
   and power it off.
   .
   IBM is working to disable this feature of OpenStack.
   .
   This was documented for IBM products that consume openstack such
   as PowerVC and ICM:
   .

   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020669 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020558http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020669]
   .
   Workaround:
   Update the nova.conf file, add :
   .
   sync_power_state_interval=-1
   .
   restart the OpenStack host OS (the Regin Server OS).
   .
   We need to document this on ICO.
