ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you try to debug a client-side human service that has
   business data that contains circular references, the browser
   crashes because the data view goes into an infinite loop trying
   to display the data.
   
   In the web browser, you see an error similar to
   
   "Error:Script terminated by timeout ..."
   
   As a result, Inspector doesn't open.
