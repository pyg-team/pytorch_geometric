ABSTRACT
 This document contains system requirements for WebSphere MQ V6 on System i and i5/OS. 

CONTENT
 

Operating Systems [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1]  * IBM OS/400 V5.2 with program temporary fix (PTF) C3077520 or later, and Javaâ„¢ Group PTF SF99169 
 * IBM i5/OS V5.3 
 * IBM i5/OS V5.4 
 * IBM i 6.1 [see note 7] 
 * IBM i 7.1 [see note 8]

Hardware Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1]  * IBM OS/400 and IBM i5/OS: IBM System i systems, capable of running the required level of a compatible operating system with enough storage to meet the combined requirements of the programming prerequisites, WebSphere MQ, the access methods and the application programs.

Java and JMS Client [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1]  * IBM AS/400 Developer Kit for Java (provided by the operating system) option 6 with JDK V1.4 
 * IBM AS/400 Developer Kit for Java (provided by the operating system) option 6 with JDK V5.0

Databases [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1] Where IBM WebSphere MQ is acting as the transaction manager.
 * IBM DB2 Universal Database provided by the level of operating system

Compilers [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1]  * IBM Integrated Language Environment C for iSeries 
 * IBM Integrated Language Environment C++ for iSeries 
 * IBM Integrated Language Environment COBOL for iSeries; 
 * IBM Integrated Language Environment RPG for iSeries 

Connectivity [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1]  * OS/400 SNA (provided by the operating system) 
 * TCP/IP (provided by the operating system). IP V6 feature support is also provided 

Transaction Manager [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1] Where one of these products is acting as the transaction manager and IBM WebSphere MQ is acting as a resource manager, it's recommended that you contact the transaction manager vendor in the first instance for support. 
 * IBM CICS/400 
 * WebSphere Application Server V5.0 & V5.1 
 * WebSphere Application Server V6.0.1 or higher [see note 4] 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V6.0.2 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307212&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more information) 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V6.1 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307203&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more information) 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V7.0 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&dc=DB540&uid=swg21316899&loc=en_US&cs=UTF-8&lang=en&rss=ct171websphere] for more information)

Cryptography Cards [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006264&amp;aid=1] Refer to the Cryptography Card List for WebSphere MQ v6 and v7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&context=SSEP7X&q1=cryptography&uid=swg21326434&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] document for further information.  

 

Notes:


 1. On OS/400 V5.2.0, it is necessary to upgrade the installed JDK V1.4.1 to V1.4.2 by applying the Java Group PTF SF99169. AS/400 Developer Kit for Java with JDK 1.4.2 is required for SSL support using Java because it provides the necessary JSSE class files. 
 2. If the AS/400 Developer Kit for Java with JDK V1.3.1 and JSSE class files can be obtained as included within an alternate IBM product, this is also a suitable environment under which SSL support using Java can be run, except for certificate checking against CRLs, which requires full JDK implementation at V1.4. 
 3. Integrated Language Environment facilities are provided as part of IBM WebSphere Development Studio for iSeries. 
 4. Where higher levels of WebSphere Application Server V6 are suggested, this only includes V6.x levels and does not include other product versions. 
 5. On 64-bit platforms where WebSphere MQ provides both a 32-bit and a 64-bit product, there is NO migration path from V6 32-bit Queue Managers to V6 64-bit Queue Managers. Customers are strongly advised to install WebSphere MQ 64-bit products on 64-bit platforms as there is a migration path from V5 32-bit products to V6 64-bit products. 
 6. The 'MQ Explorer' is not supported on this platform. 
 7. WMQ 6.0.2.5 or later is required. Also, refer to technote Details for WebSphere MQ V6 on IBM i 6.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21316815&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21288742&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en]. 
 8. WMQ 6.0.2.11 or later is required. Base support only. For WMQ Java/JMS support, it is recommended to either upgrade to WMQ V7.0.1 or higher OR install the V7.0.1 Java Client (client bindings only). Refer to SupportPac MA46 for more information on the V7.0.1 Java Client for iSeries.
