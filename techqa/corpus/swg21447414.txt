PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During inbound operation for Flat File, using splitting and pollquantity=n, BO number=n+m, m can not be transacted correctly. This has been identified as a product defect under APAR JR37548. 

SYMPTOM
While processing files, if using both file splitting and a poll quantity smaller than the file splitting size, the adapter will drop events after processing the poll quantity number up to the file split size. The dropped events will not be processed, though they do show up in the poll tracing.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Fix Pack with the code fix for this issue has been released as part of WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files 7.0.0.3. Documentation is in this fix level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27017803].


This fix is packaged as a part of WebSphere Integration Developer 7.0.0.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027754], with details and installation instructions.


By installing this tooling fix level and upgrading the version of the adapter used by the adapter, this issue can be corrected. Alternatively, by setting the poll quantity to a value larger than the file splitting size the issue can also be worked around without applying a code fix.
