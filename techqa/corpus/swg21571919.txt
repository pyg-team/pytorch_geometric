QUESTION
 How do I configure the cache size for sequences? 

ANSWER
When a sequence is defined, it pre-allocates sequence numbers to each SPU.

1. To control the number of pre-allocations, set the enable_sequence_cachesize parameter inoneof the following ways:

---at the nzsql command line:
Set enable_sequence_cachesize=1;

---orwithin the/nz/data/postgresql.conffile:
enable_sequence_cachesize=1

If you chose to enable the parameter by modifying thepostgresql.conffile and you want to make the change effective immediately, you need to restart the database as follows:

nzstop

nzstart

If a database restart is unacceptable, refer to "How do I enable changes to postgresqlconf without causing a database outage?"

2. After theenable_sequence_cachesizeparameter is enabled, use the following syntax to control the cache size when defining a sequence:

Create sequence seq1 as integer cache 1000;
