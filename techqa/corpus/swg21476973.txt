Title: IBM Changing the association for .SAV files - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have an application in addition to IBM SPSS Statistics that utilizes the .SAV extension as one of its file types. I prefer to have the other application open .SAV files when I double-click them in Windows Explorer. I can edit the current association, but when I run SPSS, it restores the association to open .SAV files in IBM SPSS Statistics. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This can be accomplished in Windows XP and Vista.

1. Open Windows Explorer (or My Computer), go to View->Options (Tools->Folder Options for Windows XP) and select the File Types tab. 

For Vista do the following:
A. Click Start.->Open Control Panel, click Control Panel Home in Windows Vista, and click Programs.
B. Click Default Programs, and click Associate a file type or protocol with a program.
C. On this screen, the registered file types are displayed. 


2. Locate .SAV under Registered File Types and delete the current association. Click OK.

3. Double-click on a file with a .SAV extension and choose the desired application to open .SAV files. Check the "Always use this program to open these files" check box. Click OK.

4. Proceed to Start->Run and type "regedit".

5. Go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SPSS.DataDoc

6. Select Security->Permissions (Edit->Permissions for Windows XP) and assign your logon to read-only permission. If you belong to a group that has less stringent permissions, you will need to configure that group with read-only permissions too. Click OK and exit the registry editor. .SAV files will be associated with the desired application even if IBM SPSS Statistics is launched.
