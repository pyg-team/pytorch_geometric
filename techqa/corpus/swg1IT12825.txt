APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A client application fails to connect to a queue manager with
   error AMQ9777: Channel was blocked.
   
   AMQ9777: Channel was blocked
   The inbound channel 'A.TO.B' was blocked from address 'abc
   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)' because the active values of the channel
   matched a record configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active
   values of the channel were 'CLNTUSER(xyz) ADDRESS(abc)'.
   
   MQ is not matching the MQCSP user against the USERMAP rule
   above. Instead it is only looking at the ID that the client
   application process is running under.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of MQCSP to identify and authenticate users may be
   affected by this problem.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When ADOPTCTX(YES) is used on the default authentication
   information object, IBM MQ was failing to honour a USERMAP rule.
   
   For example, with the following channel authentication record
   definition:
   
   SET CHLAUTH('MY.CHLAUTH') TYPE(USERMAP) DESCR('Allow user bob
   and force CONNAUTH') CLNTUSER('bob') CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED)
   USERSRC(CHANNEL)
   
   When logged in as 'fred', it might be expected that the
   following command would authenticate as 'bob':
   
   runmqsc -c -u bob QMGR
   
   In fact, the queue manager uses the logged in user identifier of
   'fred'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix may break how customers have come to expect this
   functionality to work so the new behaviour must be enabled via a
   qm.ini parameter.
   
   To have the queue manager use this new behaviour, set the
   ChlauthEarlyAdopt attribute under the Channels stanza to y or Y,
   e.g.
   
   Channels:
      ChlauthEarlyAdopt=y
   
   If security exits are enabled for the channel then
   ChlauthEarlyAdopt must be set to 'e' or 'E' otherwise
   the channel will fail to use the new behaviour.  Note that
   setting ChlauthEarlyAdopt to 'e' or 'E' when security
   exits are not in use will have the same effect as setting it to
   'y' or 'Y'.
   
   APAR IT18052 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT18052] made further changes to the new ChlauthEarlyAdopt
   parameter and so it is recommended that users review the details
   of that APAR in combination with this one.
