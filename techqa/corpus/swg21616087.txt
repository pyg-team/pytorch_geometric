QUESTION
 "When upgrading nodes in a TIP load balancing cluster (HA)to TIP 2.2, do all of the load balancing configuration steps have to be redone?"

Do I have to disjoin the servers prior to upgrading? 

ANSWER
You don't need to go through the load balancing configuration steps again, but you should disjoin the nodes before upgrading, as you otherwise will run into problems if you try to run the install while HA is enabled. 
You should disjoin all nodes from the cluster, and then you can join each one after it has been upgraded to 2.2.x.
