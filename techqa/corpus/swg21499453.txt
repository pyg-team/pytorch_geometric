QUESTION
 How do I reconfigure TIP when the IP address of the TIP server changes? 

ANSWER
For TIP 1.1.x: 
Stop the TIP server and find and replace the IP address (or host name) in the following files to the new system's IP address or host name:

<TIPHOME>/properties/tip.properties **
Alter the host IP Address and hostname properties **
(** Note: editing this file applies only the TIP 1.1.x)

<TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/nodes/TIPNode/serverindex.xml 
Alter the host and hostname properties

<TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/nodes/TIPNode/servers/server1/server.xml 
Alter the host properties

<TIPHOME>/properties/wsadmin.properties
Alter the com.ibm.ws.scripting.host and com.ibm.ws.scripting.ipchost properties

<TIPHOME>/java/jre/lib/orb.properties
Alter com.ibm.CORBA.locahost property

For TIP 2.1 and 2.2 please edit also the following two additional files: 

<TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/com.ibm.tivoli.rest.war/WEB-INF/web.xml Alter the BrokerURI value

<TIPHOME>/tipv21/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/com.ibm.tivoli.rest.war/WEB-INF/web.xml 
Alter the BrokerURI value

Once these changes are made you must restart the TIP.


Correcting the hostname in the Deployment Engine: 

Adjust the hostname in the following DE file: 

Please back up and edit the following file, modifying these properties:
/var/ibm/common/acsi/ACUApplication.properties

Change the following variable:acu.hostname=<your new hostname>
replacing<your new hostname>with the hostname of your server.


Important Note: 
This note only covers the changes needed for the Tivoli Integrated Portal core application. Additional file changes may be required for products which deploy applications in TIP (like Netcool Omnibus WebGUI, or Tivoli Business Service Manager, etc). Before completing the steps in this technical note, consult the deploying product's documentation, or contact IBM Support to inquire about the changes needed for the specific products deployed in the target TIP installation.
