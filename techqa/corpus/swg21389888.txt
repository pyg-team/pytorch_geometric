QUESTION
 What are some of the upgrade scenarios for IBM Rational ClearCase 7.1 using IBM Installation Manager? 

CAUSE

When planning your ClearCase or ClearQuest deployment here are some options to consider.



ANSWER
 

 

IBM Installation Manager is the installation method for all ClearCase and ClearQuest 7.1.x and higher on all operating systems. 

 

It handles installs for the products as well as for any testfixes, iFixes or Fix Packs. 

There is a way to do everything silently and you have some options as to how you want to manage it within your organization. You also can use the graphical user interface (GUI) for those platforms that support the Installation Manager GUI. 

 

The following links show which platforms the GUI is not supported on: 

 

ClearQuest platforms that do not support Installation Manager GUI [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21373401]. 

ClearCase platforms that do not support Installation Manager GUI [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21373364]. 

 

 

There are several ways to do this, each of which has its own set of benefits (and or limitations) 

 

For example, some sites may want to remove the ability of their end users to touch their installs (for instance, an admin group might want to be totally in control of when their users upgrade, when they uninstall, what features they can install, or other reasons). For those sets of clients you would want to go with the method where you do not install Installation Manager on the clients and only push out the product installs. Using this option restricts you to using silent install to do everything. It does not completely remove the ability from the end-user to modify their install, however, it makes it a lot more difficult as they have to know where the network location of Installation Manager is and they need to know about response files. 

 

 
This means that whenever the administrators want their users to upgrade to the next fix pack, they push out the upgrades using a silent install script. 

 

For those sites that want to allow their end-users the flexibility of controlling "what" features they install, what version they install, and when they upgrade, then those sites will want their end users to install the Installation Manager. This gives those end-users the ability to use silent or GUI based installs (again for those platforms that the GUI is supported on). 

 

Anytime you are using silent install you need to first start by creating response files (or using the ones shipped with the media). 

 

 

How to organize or edit the response file(s)? 

 

You can choose to have a set of response files either organized by feature sets (and then have the names correlate to the versions your users can upgrade to) or organized by versions 7.1.1, 7.1.1.1, 7.1.1.2, and then have the file names for each version say what features it installs. 

 

Sample response files: 

For IBM Rational ClearCase [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21351501]
For IBM Rational ClearQuest [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21348204] 




Many repositories - or just one? 

 

Using multiple repositories 

 

When new Fix Packs or iFixes are released, clients can choose to add lines to the response file(s), pointing to all new repositories. There is no limit to the number of repositories you can point to with your response file. 

 

Example section of a response file with repositories: 

 

 

<server> 

<repository location='/enterprise/7.1_cc_linux/disk1'/> 

<repository location='/enterprise/7.1_CQ_linux/disk1'/> 

<repository location='/enterprise/7.1.0.1_RCC/7.1.0.1-RATL-RCC.linux_x86'/> 

<repository location='/enterprise7.1.0.1_RCQ/7.1.0.1-RATL-RCQ.linux_x86'/> 

</server> 




 

 

Using one repository 

 

Alternatively, you can choose to create a single repository and each time a new patch is released, the repository is updated using the IBM Packaging Utility: You can also have multiple products in the same repository, however, it is important to note that the IBM Packaging Utility does not validate that the product versions in your repository are compatible. For example, Installation Manager will fail to install or upgrade ClearCase and ClearQuest if they are not at the exact same version (such as, version 7.1.1.1). However, IBM Packaging Utility will allow you to create a repository with ClearCase 7.1.1 and ClearQuest 7.1.1.1 and not complain. This combined repository could still be used to "just" install ClearCase or "just" install ClearQuest but could not be used to install both products until the 7.1.1.1 fixpack for ClearCase is applied to the repository. 

 

Using this method simplifies the response files as now you only need to have one line pointing to the one repository, and there is no need to update the response file every time there is a new update. 

 

Information about IBM Packaging Utility 

 

Each time a new version of Installation Manager is released a new version of the IBM Packaging Utility is released. 

 

Here is the Latest version of the IBM Packaging Utility. [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?&q=packaging+utility+RNLTST] 

 

Sample update script: 

 

There is a very simple "update" script that will upgrade all products to whatever the highest version in the repository list is. 

This method is easy to maintain as no changes are needed in the response file, however, there is the need for someone to maintain the repository and to keep it current with the fix packs and products to which you want your end-users to be able to install or upgrade. 

 

If you always want your users just to be able to upgrade to the latest, then you do not need to have different copies, you can just update this one file. 

 

Below is a simple upgrade script: 

 


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 

<agent-input clean='true'> 

<server> 

<repository location='[Your repository location]'/> 

</server> 

 

<updateAll/>


<!-- this prevents the Installation Manager from searching the repositories contributed by the packages which typically refer to update sites on the internet --> 

<preference name='offering.service.repositories.areUsed' value='false'/> 

 

</agent-input> 

 

 

 

So this script never mentions a particular version and will upgrade all products to that latest version that is available from the repositories it loads at the beginning of the file. 

All you need to do each time an iFix or Fix Pack is released is just unzip the repository and use the IBM Packaging Utility to add that iFix or FixPack to the existing repository. 

 

 

An example for one repository for several patch levels 

 

You create a repository, using IBM Packaging Utility and can add, for example, ClearCase 7.1.0.0, ClearCase 7.1.0.1 and ClearCase 7.1.0.1_iFix01 to the repository. 

 

Any client that goes to that repository now has the ability to install the following versions: 

 

ClearCase 7.1.0.0 

ClearCase 7.1.0.1 

ClearCase 7.1.0.1_iFix01 

 

If a client has one of the lower versions installed (for example, version 7.1.0.0), you can upgrade to either 7.1.0.1 or 7.1.0.1_iFix01. 

 

This also allows an installation directly to 7.1.0.1_iFix01 if nothing is on the machine. Note, however, that this is also possible using the many repository options above. 

 

 Once you have a repository that has all 3 versions (7.1.0, 7.1.0.1 and.1.0.1-Fix01) you could then record an install of "whatever version you want" and then each of those file(s) can be used for a silent installation to that specific version. 

 

 

Various Installation scenarios 

 

Here is a link to a document that gives you a variety of Installation Scenarios (one of which is the scenario where you do not install Installation Manager on each client).
