APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the logTransferRecovery agent property is set to true
   (which is the default value) diagnostic messages are reported in
   the agent's event log when a transfer enters recovery
   processing.  These log messages have the identifiers:
   
     - BFGTR0062I
     - BFGTR0063I
     - BFGTR0067I
     - BFGTR0068I
   
   For example:
   
   BFGTR0068I: Transfer ID:
   414d51204d465438305f514d4752202082e6355720004f03 entering
   recovery, immediately, due to recoverable error: BFGTR0064I: The
   transfer sender timed out waiting for a response from the
   transfer receiver.
   
   These diagnostic log messages contain the transfer identifier
   for transfer that has entered recovery and the reason why.
   However it does not contain the name of the partner agent for
   this transfer.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a transfer entered recovery on an agent and a diagnostic
   message was written to the agent's event log file, it was not
   possible to tell from the log message written what the name of
   the partner agent was for the transfer.

     - BFGTR0063I
     - BFGTR0067I
     - BFGTR0068I

   414d51204d465438305f514d4752202082e6355720004f03 with partner
   agent AGENT2 is entering recovery, immediately, due to
   recoverable error: BFGTR0064I: The transfer sender timed out
   waiting for a response from the transfer receiver.
