PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to find JDBC driver jar file when configuring GCD datasource using IBM FileNet Configuration Manager 

SYMPTOM
When using IBM FileNet Configuration Manager, at the stage of configuring GCD JDBC data source, after providing all the details requested, and clicking on Test Database Connection, An error message is displayed: 

DSRA8000E: No jar or zip files fount at D:/jars/ojdbc.jar


CAUSE
There are two FileNet Content Engine Servers(CE)in this environment, which form a CE farm environment. The client only deployed the JDBC jar file in one of the CE servers, but the configuration manager searches all the CE servers configured in the Websphere cluster for JDBC drive jar file. If it could not find the jar file in one of the server, it throws the error.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Verify the jar file can be found at the location: D:/jars 

 2. Confirm that the jar is fine by copying the jar file from a working environment
3. Verify that the ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH is set in the Websphere Variables, and it is properly set


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
So all the CE servers should have this JDBC jar file, and the jar file should be located in the same location. In this case, it is in the path D:/jars.
