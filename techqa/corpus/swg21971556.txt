Question 4: In case of HA pool, how to pro-actively monitor the database performance? Is there any automatic monitoring of database in traveler? 
Answer : As of now, there is no feature available to monitor the database from traveler end. However, DB2 administrator may monitor the database performance with DB2 utilities. 

Question 5: If the Primary DB2 is down on what interval the secondary DB2 server will take effect ? Do DB2 team has to play any role in this fail over/switch over? How do I do manually switch over to secondary DB2 from Traveler server?
Answer : This is on basis of how you have configured DB2 for traveler. Yes, DB2 team can give more clarity on this. 

Question 6: What are the values retryIntervalForClientReroute=10; maxRetriesForClientReroute=3 signifies? ( I referred http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593442 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593442] but unable to understand)
Answer : These are DB2 queries which are used by Traveler. It would be good to get a PMR created with DB2 for more clarity on this.
