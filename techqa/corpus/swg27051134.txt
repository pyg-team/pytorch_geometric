Known issues 
This section outlines the known issues and their workarounds (if any). 

Issue 1 Users Affected : Customers using IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender(WTX) version 8.4.1.2. 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender(WTX) version 8.4.1.2 who use native schema and choice sequence iterations are unable to access iterations of a particular sequence group. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue(APAR PI31636) is available in WTX v8.4.1.3. 

Issue 2 

Users Affected : Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.x. 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.x may experience the following BIP2930E error when deploying or restarting the broker. 

RecoverableException BIP2930E: A function or procedure was called but the value supplied for the ''cAppVer'' parameter was of type ''BOOLEAN'' but the function/procedure expects value of type ''CHARACTER'' Functions and procedures require an exact matching between the data type of values supplied as parameters and the data type in its definition. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue(IIB APAR IT06286) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4. 

Issue 3 

Users Affected : Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.3. 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.3 may experience the following BIP2503E when executing customer flows if propagating from a node after exiting a FOR loop acting on a shared variable. 

RecoverableException BIP2503E: Propagate with a SHARED variable lock held by FOR statement. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue(IIB APAR IT07974) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4. 

Issue 4 

Users Affected : Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.5. 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus(IIB) version 9.0.0.5 may experience the following issue: 

If a user has a REFERENCE variable declared at the module or schema level which points at either OutputRoot, OutputLocalEnvironment or OutputExceptionList and performs a PROPAGATE without specifying DELETE NONE in a compute node then it is not defined what the REFERENCE variable will be left pointing at. After the PROPAGATE the Output trees are deleted and the REFERENCE variables should be reset to point at the root of the newly created trees.The module and schema level reference variables are not being reset and are thus left to point at the original syntax element which they were pointing at which will now have been reset leading to unexpected results. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue(IIB APAR IT14426) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.6. 

Issue 5 

Users Affected : Customers using any Broker level from v7.x. 

Summary : 

Customers using any Broker level from v7.x may experience inconsistent validation results when using FTM Channel based validation and/or IIB in ESQL parser validation. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue(IIB APAR IT14075) is available in IIB Maintenance Levels 8.0.0.8, 9.0.0.6 and 10.0.0.5 

Issue 6 

Users Affected : Customers using Oracle Database v11.x and above. 

Summary : 

FTM(with Oracle) users may experience the following issues when using the Multi Row Insert(MRI) function : "ORA-00932 inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got TIMESTAMP" "ORA-01400 cannot insert NULL into ()" This issue is a known Oracle issue - reference Oracle bug # 9648430. 

Resolution : 

Apply the Oracle fix. If an Oracle fix is not available for your version of Oracle then a workaround is to disable MRI in FTM as follows: 

Category Key Value
CORE MRI_EM2_ENABLED N


For additional details about the Database Persistence API configuration, see the following section in the Knowledge Center for Financial Transaction Manager, Version 3.2.0 : Financial Transaction Manager -> Application programming -> Actions -> Database Persistence -> API configuration [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRH46_3.2.0/fxhprogactionsdbpersistapicfg.html] 

Issue 7 

Users Affected : Customers using FTM SWIFT WTX maps. 

Summary : 

FTM SWIFT SR2016 WTX maps will not work with FTM SWIFT SR2015 WTX maps at a single broker instance together at the same time. 

The reason is that IBM Transformation Extender has changed the JVCWrapper code with the new Financial Payments Pack for SWIFT 9.0.1 release and it is not compatible with the earlier Pack for SWIFT releases. 

Resolution : 

Therefore using multiple Pack for SWIFT versions at the same time in a specific instance of a program is not supported. 

Issue 8 

Users Affected : Customers using IBM Integration Bus v10 

Summary : 

BIP4633E: An error occurred whilst performing an MQGet node operation. 
BIP4630E: An MQGET operation was unsuccessful. Completion Code 2; Reason Code 2046. 
An MQGet node in a message flow may fail if the user has used the LocalEnvironment to override some of the MQGET message options but not the 'Options' specific field. 

Resolution : 

Request fixes for IIB APAR IT24438 from IBM support. 

Issue 9 

Users Affected : Customers using IBM Integration Bus v10 fixpack 10(v10.0.0.10) 

Summary : 

From IIB v10 FP10 onwards, it was observed that when a usertrace/service trace is enabled, the log inserts were incorrectly populated for certain BIP messages that correspond to ESQL processing. 
For example : Comparison of the traces between FP09 and FP10 shows following difference for BIP2539I message. 
FP09 :- BIP2539I: Node '': Evaluating expression ''J'' at ('.testflow_Compute.CopyMessageHeaders', '5.13'). This resolved to ''J''. The result was ''3''. 
FP10 :- BIP2539I: Node '{5}': Evaluating expression '{4}' at ('J','3'). This resolved to ''J''. The result was ''. 

Resolution : 

Request fixes for IIB APAR IT24909 from IBM support.
