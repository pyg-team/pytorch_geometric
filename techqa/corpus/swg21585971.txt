PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you log onto the Process Center console with a user account that belongs to the "tw_admins" group, the "Add a New Offline Server" button might not display under the Servers tab and the Admin tab might not display. 

CAUSE
If any user account in the "tw_admins" group removes the administrative privilege, the group loses its administrative privilege as well. Thus, every user that belongs to the "tw_admins" group cannot see the "Add a New Offline Server" button under the Servers tab nor access the Admin tab.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To determine whether administrative privileges are set, complete the following steps: 

 1. Open the LSW_ACL_ENTRY table for the ACL of the "tw_admins" group.
    
    
 2. Check the row whose "GROUP_ID" is 3, and "ACL_ENTRY_ID" is 1. If the value of "MASK" column is 127, the group "tw_admins" has administrative privilege. Otherwise, the "tw_admins" group does not have any administrative privileges.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Stop the Process Center server.
    
    
 2. Review the LSW_ACL_ENTRY table in Business Process Manager database and ensure that the value of the "MASK" column with "GROUP_ID" = 3 and the "ACL_ENTRY_ID" = 1 is 127.
    
    
 3. Restart the Process Center server.
    
    
 4. Log onto the Process Center console with any user account in the "tw_admins" group. 



The "Add a New Offline Server" button under the Servers tab and the Admin tab display successfully.
