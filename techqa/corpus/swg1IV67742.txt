ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is installing JazzSM using Launchpad -> Custom flow.
   Registry and reporting services installation fails with error
   message as "Port number should be an integer between 0 and
   65535. You have entered an invalid port number.Enter valid port
   number."
   Problem identified in customer environment is that DB2 instance
   was not properly configured for TCPIP communication protocol.
   DB2 command "db2 get dbm cfg" was returning empty value for
   Service Name. But installer log did not mention about this
   specific error and after enabling install debug level, root
   cause is found. Install log should be able to tell about
   improper DB2 configuration.
