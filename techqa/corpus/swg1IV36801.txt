LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On certain platforms and processors, the JVM now starts with
   large pages enabled by default for both the JIT code cache and
   the Java object heap, instead of the default operating system
   page size.
   On z/OS, the JVM uses 1M pageable large pages, when running on
   the IBM zEnterprise EC12 with the Flash Express feature (#0402),
   z/OS V1.13 with APAR OA41307 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1OA41307], and the z/OS V1.13 Remote Storage
   Manager Enablement Offering web deliverable.
   Note: PAGESCM=ALL <HAT>00 NONE in the IEASYSxx parmlib member
   controls 1M pageable large pages for the entire LPAR. ALL is the
   default.
   The following sizes apply to Linux:
       Linux on x86 and AMD64/EM64T: 2 MB large pages
       Linux on System z: 1 MB large pages
   Note: These changes do not apply to Linux on IBM POWER?
   platforms.
   If the operating system is not configured for the large page
   size, or if the correct hardware is not available, the JVM uses
   the default operating system page size instead.
   You can configure the large page size using the -Xlp command.
   For more information about the -Xlp command, see JVM
   command-line options:
