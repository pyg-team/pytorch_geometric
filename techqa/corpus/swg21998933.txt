QUESTION
 Can I install my Guardium S-TAP into a GIM environment from the DB Server so that the the S-TAP installs immediately ? - (instead of installing via the Guardium Appliance GUI) 

ANSWER
In a GIM environment, some customers prefer to install the S-TAPs from the DB Server as user root to minimise installation delays that can occur when installing the S-TAP via the Guardium Appliance GUI . 

This can be achieved by using the correct gim shell installer from the GIM_Packages directory that can be found within the S-TAP product download 

The following is an example installing an S-TAP (on Solaris) into an existing GIM environment - note the .gim.sh extension used

The S-TAP can then be maintained via the Guardium Appliance GUI via GIM as standard. 

The key to this type of S-TAP installation is that this method allows the S-TAP to be installed into the GIM environment from the DB Server instead of as a standalone install of the S-TAP that ends up outside of the GIM environment.
