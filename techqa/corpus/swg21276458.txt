PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Retrieval of Search Templates in Workplace is slow 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Software Versions:
P8 Workplace/Content Engine 3.0

When selecting Search from the Workplace menu and clicking the desired objectstore to retrieve the Search Templates, retrieval of the templates for some objectstores is slow.

Searches are retrieved based on the SearchType Property Definition included in the Stored Search class. If retrieval of the Search Templates is slow, create an index on this property definition using EM as follows:
1. Open the Object Stores node and expand the desired Object Store.
2. Expand the Document Class node.
3. Right-click the Stored Search class and select Properties.
4. From the Property Definitions tab, select the Search Type property and click the Edit button.
5. In the Search Type Properties dialog click the Set/Remove button.
6. Select the Set radio button and check the Single Indexed checkbox.
7. Click OK, OK, OK to close all dialogs.

Note that this must be done for each Object Store experiencing slow performance retrieving Search Templates. This will create an index on the database field that corresponds to the Search Type property. There is potential for some performance degradation during the actual creation of the index so it is recommended that this be done during non-peak production hours.
