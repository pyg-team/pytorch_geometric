PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ILMT/BFI customer who run the BigFix platform version 9.2.5, 9.2.6, 9.2.7, 9.5.0 or 9.5.1 may hit a problem of not updated software/hardware inventory after the successfull ETL import from BigFix. 

SYMPTOM
BFI/ILMT fixlets related to software/hardware scan execution/upload are positively accomplished however still after the ETL import the software/hardware inventory is not updated on the UI.


CAUSE
The issue is caused by the BigFix Platform APAR IV83671

ENVIRONMENT
BigFix version 9.2.5, 9.2.6, 9.2.7, 9.5.0 or 9.5.1 with ILMT/BFI installed. Please note that the ILMT/BFI version is not important here. Also, the issue may appear on any environment size!

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
See more under:


https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IV83671 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IV83671]

Customer may check individual files being uploaded into the BigFix server directory
wwwrootbes/Uploads/UploadManagerData/BufferDir/sha1 
which should by default explicitly have been reflected on the ILMT/BFI UI after successful ETL import . On the affected environment data will be not imported and hence not visible on the ILMT/BFI UI.

In order to mitigate the issue, please periodically restart the FillDB service on the BigFix server. 

Pleas note that the official fix will be delivered in the following BigFix product versions:
9.2.8 - tentative plan for delivery is end of June
