QUESTION
 How can FileNet Workplace XT logging be enabled? 

ANSWER

Gather WorkplaceXT_Trace.log and WorkplaceXT_Debug.log using the following steps:


 1. Stop Workplace XT 
    
    
 2. Rename the __log4j.properties in<xt_install_root>/FileNet/Config/WebClient to log4j.properties 
    
    
 3. Open the log4j.properties and change the following lines. It is near the bottom of the file. 
    
    From: 
    log4j.logger.com.filenet-debug=OFF, DebugOutputFileAppender 
    
    To: 
    log4j.logger.com.filenet-debug=ALL, DebugOutputFileAppender 
    
    From: 
    log4j.logger.com.filenet-trace=OFF, TraceOutputFileAppender 
    
    To: 
    log4j.logger.com.filenet-trace=ON, TraceOutputFileAppender 
    
    From:
    log4j.appender.DebugOutputFileAppender.File={LOG_FILE_DIR}WorkplaceXT_Debug.log
    
    To: log4j.appender.DebugOutputFileAppender.File=<xt_install_root>/FileNet/WebClient/LogFiles/WorkplaceXT_Debug.log
    
    From:
    log4j.appender.DebugOutputFileAppender.File={LOG_FILE_DIR}WorkplaceXT_Trace.log
    
    To:
    log4j.appender.TraceOutputFileAppender.File=<xt_install_root>FileNet/WebClient/LogFiles/WorkplaceXT_Trace.log
    
    
 4. Save and close the log4j.properties. 
    
    
 5. Login to Workplace XT. Check the Logfiles directory. If the files were not created restart the Workplace XT instance.
    
    Note: It is important to follow above steps and rename the log4j.properties back to __log4j.properties after log files are collected. Logging creates a performance impact on Workplace XT.
