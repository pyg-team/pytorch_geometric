Title: IBM DataStage client logins fail with a "lassDefFoundError". - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 All DataStage client logins fail with following error dialog: 

Failed to authenticate the current user against the selected Services Tier

lassDefFoundError: com.ibm.iis.isf.admin.config.impl.IISConfigPropertiesImpl &#40;initialization failure&#41; 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The above specific error (including lassDefFoundError detail) occurs when the Services tier (WebSphere Application Server) has problem accessing the metadata repository. Most commonly this is due to the xmeta password expiring but other database problems could also create same symptom. 

To confirm cause of problem, navigate to the ASBServer/bin directory on services tier machine (i.e. C:\IBM\InformationServer\ASBServer\bin on Windows or /opt/IBM/InforamtionServer/ASBServer/bin on unix systems).

Then use the AppServerAdmin command to test database login using the stored xmeta password, i.e.: 
Windows: AppServerAdmin.bat -w
Unix: ./AppServerAdmin.sh -w

This command will either report "Database Connection OK" if xmeta id can be used to connect to database, or it will give an error stating cause of connection failure (password expired, userid revoked, database unreachable, etc). 

If this command reports that connection is OK, but user logins fail, then you will need to review the WebSphere SystemOut.log to see what errors are listed. Any SQL errors should be logged in this file:
Windows: C:\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\InfoSphere\logs\server1\SystemOut.log
Unix: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/logs/server1/SystemOut.log

Any database error reported either by AppServerAdmin command or in WebSphere log must be corrected. After correction you may also need to restart WebSphere Application Server.

If the error was due to expired or invalid xmeta password, use the following instructions to set the stored xmeta password to the correct value (after first setting/resetting actual database password on Database server if needed):
