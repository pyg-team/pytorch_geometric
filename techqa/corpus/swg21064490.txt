Text:

QUESTION
 Why is the new owner not saved when I update a work package owner using the DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() method? How do I set the owner of a work package? What is the difference between the DKDocRoutingServiceICM::setWorkPackageOwner() and DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() methods? 

ANSWER
You can update the work package owner in the datastore using the DKDocRoutingServiceICM::setWorkPackageOwner() method. You can update the owner in memory using the DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() method. You can use the methods together to modify both your object in memory and modify the persistent datastore. 

Setting the owner using the DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() method has no affect on the persistent datstore. There is no way to make persistent such changes to a DKWorkPackageICM object in memory. 

How to set work package owner in the datastore only 

If you want to set the owner of a work package in the datastore only, not affecting a work package that you might have already retrieved, use the DKDocRoutingServiceICM::setWorkPackageOwner() method. 

How to set work package owner in the memory only 

Use the DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() method to modify the object in memory. Using this method should not affect the actual owner of the object. There should be no reason to set the owner in the object only. 

How to set work package owner in both memory and the datastore 

Use DKDocRoutingServiceICM::setWorkPackageOwner() to change the owner in the persistent datastore and then update any objects in memory using the DKWorkPackageICM::setOwner() method. Alternatively, you can re-retrieve the work package after you change the owner persistently.
