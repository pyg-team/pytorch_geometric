QUESTION
 FileNet Content Platform Engine - How can objects for which Retention has not been specified be excluded from a Disposal Policy? 

CAUSE
Disposal Policies are designed to assist in bulk deleting P8 objects which meet a certain criteria. If retention has been configured, objects currently held under retention (retention date is in the future, indefinite or permanent) will not be deleted by a disposal policy, but objects for which the retention date has been specified and has past will be deleted. In addition, any documents for which a retention date was not specified will also be deleted. 
How can one configure a Disposal Policy to only delete objects for which retention has been specified and has already passed and ignore any objects which do not have a retention date set? 


ANSWER
When creating the Disposal Policy, specify a filter expression including the following condition to not delete objects for which retention has not been configured : 

CmRetentionDate is not Null 

 

Only objects for which CmRetention date has a value and that value is less than current time will then be deleted by the Disposal Policy.
