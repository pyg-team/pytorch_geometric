Title: IBM Dialog box does not launch within IBM SPSS Statistics - United States

Text:
Dialog box frequency options not launch missing hang TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Due to the use of dual monitors we have lost the ability to see the certain dialog boxes in SPSS. It has happened to Frequencies ,Custom Tables, and other analyses. We have tried running a repair on the current installation, but this has not corrected the problem. Is there anything else we can try? 

SYMPTOM
Missing Frequencies dialog box. 


CAUSE
Perhaps this dialog box was "misplaced" by moving it between the two monitors in my dual monitor set up. 

ENVIRONMENT
Windows operating system. SPSS Statistics 21.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To try and correct this, launch SPSS and go to Window->reset dialog sizes and positions. Click the OK button. Try your analysis again. Does it work? If not, then try these steps below 




Make the following changes to the registry key. 

Please first choose Start->Run and type: regedit
This will open up the Registry Editor. Once this has been opened, simply go to this key: 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\com\ibm\/S/P/S/S\/Statistics\21.0\ui\ 

or 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\com\ibm\/S/P/S/S\/Statistics\22.0\ui\

click on /W/I/N/D/O/W_/I/N/F/O_/P/R/E/F/S

Double click on the key labelled:

/W/I/N/D/O/W_/S/I/Z/E_/L/O/C/A/T/I/O/N
