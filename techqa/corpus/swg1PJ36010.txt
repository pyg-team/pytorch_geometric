ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The actual problem is that multiple CE threads are trying to
   connect to the same IS using the same FCD GUID rather than
   unique GUIDs.
   The problem has always been there, but the password
   encryption/decryption (PED) protocol is only executed when you
   first connect to that IS system or if you haven't used the
   system in a long time and the password has expired.  You might
   want to add deleting of the password cache directory (the pkcf
   directory) to the testing, to force it te re-execute the PED
   code.  That should  catch errors like this in the future.
   ------------------------------
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? : I
   noticed it after upgrading to CE 4.5.0 FP1 , but it was
   probably there earlier.
   The password probably expirred, and caused the PED code to be
   executed
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   Is there a workaround? : Workaround used on my system by
   Margaret
   The steps I did is not guaranteed to work every time because it
   is timing sensitive,  I disabled the Import Agents, cleared
   the encryption keys on IS (/fnsw/local/sd/1/kpkf) and CE (<bea
   domain>/AdminServer/Content/pkcf), restart IS and CE,  then
   look at the mapping in EM to force an initial logon to IS and
   hopefully create the new encryption key, then re-enable the
   import agents. The agents will use the encryption keys instead
   of trying to create new ones.
   I think we need a better workaround.  But I do not have one
   yet, need to talk to Alan.
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : The import agents
   do not come up, so no documents federate
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N:
   Yes, nt88cef
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Have to have multiple object stores on one IS (ibm53d2r has
   four of them)
   2. My password expired, but Laura says deleting the password
   chache directory will show the problem
   3. Start WebLogic.. the import agents get a logon error.
