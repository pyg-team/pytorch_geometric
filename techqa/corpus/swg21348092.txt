Title: IBM 'The log file for database 'controller' is full. Back up....' when using Controller - United States

Text:
db device TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User receives error message when performing functions in Controller.


SYMPTOM
Example #1: User is trying to copy values between periods in Controller 2.x 

Information
Standard Error
Number: -2147217900
Source: FrangoDirect.CopyValuesD.GroupJouBetweenPer#FrCopyValuesBT.CopyValuesT.CopyValues
Description: The log file for database 'controller' is full. Back up the transacion log for the database to free up some log space.
[OK]


Example #2: User is trying to run a report in Controller 10.1
COMException (0x80040E14): The transaction log for database 'tempdb' is full. To find out why space in the log cannot be reused, see the log_reuse_wait_desc column in sys.databases 

CAUSE
Microsoft SQL server cannot increase the size of the transaction log (LDF file) for the relevant database. 

 
There are several potential causes for this, such as: 

 * The SQL server's hard drive is full, so it cannot increase the size of the LDF file 
 * The relevant database (for example 'controller' or 'tempdb') has been configured to have a maximum log file size. This maximum limit has now been reached.

ENVIRONMENT
Controller application database hosted on Microsoft SQL Server.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ask your I.T. department's SQL DBA to reconfigure the SQL server so that the SQL database(s) can grow. 

 

Steps: 

The steps that the DBA will need to perform will depend on the relevant cause (and customer's environment/needs). Below are some suggestions: 

 * Truncate (compact) the database transaction log  * TIP: For more details, see separate IBM Technote #1367388
   
   
 * Free up diskspace on the drive where database is located (for example, delete unwanted files) 
 * If the transaction logfile have growth restrictions, remove these restrictions 
 * Increase the drive space of the database server 
 * Reconfigure the databases so that their MDF/LDF data files are moved to a hard drive with more space.
