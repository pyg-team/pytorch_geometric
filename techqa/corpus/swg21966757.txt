PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Any user who has an account in the user repository can login to DASH whether they have been given user roles or not. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is possible to control user access for those accounts which don't have an assigned role by changing the "AUTHENTICATIONONLY" value to "false" in the consoleProperties.xml file. 

1) Stop the server 

2) Edit the file: 

<PROFILE>/config/cells/<CELLNAME>/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF/consoleProperties.xml 

<consoleproperties:console-property id="AUTHENTICATIONONLY" value="true" />

to

<consoleproperties:console-property id="AUTHENTICATIONONLY" value="false" />

Note: It is highly recommended a backup of the file be made and kept in a safe location.

3) Start the server 

DASH login page now gives this message for all user not having a role: 

"The specified user ID does not have any roles providing access. Please contact the administrator."
