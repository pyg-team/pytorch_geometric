Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM Platform Cluster Manager and IBM Platform HPC (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
SSLv3 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in Platform Cluster Manager and Platform HPC. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/97013 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Platform Cluster Manager v3.2, v4.1.x

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation such as disabling SSLv3 and remediation actions. 

If you have HTTPS enabled, complete the following steps. Otherwise, no action is required. 

For Platform Cluster Manager – Standard Edition and Platform HPC:

1. Source your environment. 
- For Platform HPC Version 3.2 or Platform Cluster Manager Version 3.2, run the following command:
# source /opt/kusu/bin/pcmenv.sh
- For Platform HPC Version 4.1.1 or 4.1.1.1, run the following command: 
# source /opt/pcm/bin/pcmenv.sh
- For Platform Cluster Manager Version 4.1, 4.1.1, or 4.1.1.1, run the following command: 
# source /opt/pcm/bin/pcmenv.sh

2. Edit the $GUI_CONFDIR/server.xml file. In the connector XML tag, set the sslProtocol value from SSL to TLS, and save the file. For example:

<Connector port="${CATALINA_HTTPS_START_PORT}" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192” maxThreads="${CATALINA_MAX_THREADS}" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS" algorithm="ibmX509"
compression="on" compressionMinSize="2000"
compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,text/css,text/javascript,text/plain"
connectionTimeout="20000" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

Note: 

If you have a high availability environment enabled in Platform HPC Version 3.2 or Platform Cluster Manager Version 3.2, the server.xml file must be modified on the master host and on the master candidate host. 

If you have a high availability environment enabled in Platform HPC Version 4.1.1 or later, the server.xml must be modified on the primary management node only. 

If you have a high availability environment enabled in Platform Cluster Manager Version 4.1 or later, the server.xml must be modified on the primary management node only. 


3. Restart the Web Portal service.

- If a high availability environment is not enabled, run the following command:

# pmcadmin stop
# pmcadmin start

- If a high availability environment is enabled:


- For Platform HPC Version 3.2 or Platform Cluster Manager Version 3.2, run the following command on the master host:
# pmcadmin stop
# pmcadmin start
- For Platform HPC Version 4.1.1 or 4.1.1.1, run the following command on the primary management node: 
# pcm-ha-support stop --service WEBGUI 
# pcm-ha-support start --service WEBGUI
- For Platform Cluster Manager Version 4.1, 4.1.1, or 4.1.1.1, run the following command on the primary management node: 
# pcm-ha-support stop --service WEBGUI 
# pcm-ha-support start --service WEBGUI

For Platform Cluster Manager – Advanced Edition:

1. Edit the install_dir/gui/conf/server.xml file. In the connector XML tag, set the sslProtocol value from SSL to TLS, and save the file, where install_dir is the top-level management server installation directory. install_dir is set to /opt/platform by default. For example:

<Connector port="${CATALINA_HTTPS_START_PORT}" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192” maxThreads="${CATALINA_MAX_THREADS}" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS" algorithm="ibmX509"
compression="on" compressionMinSize="2000"
compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,text/css,text/javascript,text/plain"
connectionTimeout="20000" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

Note: 

If a high availability environment is enabled, the path to the server.xml is SHAREDDIR/gui/conf/server.xml, where SHAREADDIR is the directory set by the users during the installation process. The server.xml only needs to be modified on the primary management node. 


2. Restart the Web Portal service.

# egosh user logon -u Admin -x Admin
# egosh service stop WEBGUI
# egosh service start WEBGUI

Note:

If a high availability environment is enabled, only restart the Web Portal service on the primary management node.
