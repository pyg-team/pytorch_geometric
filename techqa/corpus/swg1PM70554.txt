APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Manageprofiles works successfully when commandDefault is JDK
   1.6_64.
   When switched to 1.7_64, manageprofiles command fails in
   between.
   
   Recreation step-
   
   1) managesdk -setCommandDefault -sdkname 1.7_64
   2) manageprofiles -create -profileName <Name> -profilePath
   <Path> -templatePath <Path>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In regards to the temporary workaround provided for profile
   creation, we advise to set newProfileDefault and CommandDefault
   to the desired value before creation of a profile. So if client
   wishes to create profiles with java 1.7, the client should call:
   
   managesdk.bat -setCommandDefault -sdkname 1.7_64
   managesdk.bat -setNewProfileDefault -sdkname 1.7_64
   
   before creation of a profile.
   Note, the following commands:
   
   managesdk.bat -getCommandDefault
   managesdk.bat -getNewProfileDefault
   
   can be used to find the current values CommandDefault and
   NewProfileDefault. If client wishes to create with java 1.7 and
   both values are already 1.7_64, then client can continue to
   create a profile. The same applies for creation with java 1.6.
   (i.e. set values to 1.6_64)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5 on Microsoft Windows with IBM   *
   *                  software Development Kit 1.7 installed and  *
   *                  who want to use IBM SDK 1.7 for profile     *
   *                  creation.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Profile Creation will hang if you       *
   *                      wish to use IBM Software Development    *
   *                      Kit 1.7 for profile creation.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When you want to use IBM's java Software Development Kit 1.7
   for use in creation of a profile through commandline, it will
   hang if the following command was used before profile creation:
   "managesdk.bat -setCommandDefault -sdkname 1.7_**". On 64-bit
   Microsoft Windows, there will be a popup box displaying:
   "Java(TM) Platform SE binary has stopped working".
   The entire problem is caused when wsadminlistener is launched
   with an environment variable having the wrong values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The environment variable was modified with the appropriate
   values before wsadminlistener is launched to prevent the
   problem.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.0.2.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
