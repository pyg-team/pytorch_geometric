   ABSTRACT: Contradicting effectivities when
    reinstanciating a versioned part
    .
    DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
    This bug is extracted from the correspondence on bug 905
    (PMR83327) as Emma Edsall has recommended it:
    "I have noticed one remaining problem with the
    "Choose a date" panel when also using associated actions:
    1. In the modif I use D-D=2002-10-16 and Spec=GREEN
    2. Then I associate the action to the session and create
     a new version of the part.
    3. In the "Choose a date"-panel I set Date=2002-10-18.
    The new version get the effectivity 2002-10-18 and RED.
    4. Then I make a new instance of the new version
    (note this is the opposite order from what you described,
    but I see no logic that says that,
    it shouldn*t be possible to do it this way, too). This
    instance get the effectivity 2002-10-16 and GREEN from
    the action| Two days earlier than,the RED instance...
    As has been raised at the R10 CI selection, I beleive there
    are some fundamental problems with the "Choose a date"-panel
    and the use of Actions, and Cust. needs to be able to control
    the efectivity via the
    actions* modifs. "
    .
    Test Scenario:
    The issue addressed in this test is Contradicting
    effectivities when reinstanciating a versioned part
    1.  In the Product Class Editor - Create a PRC - PRc1
    2.  In the Category Editor - Create a Category - Colors
    3.  Add specifications of red, blue & green
    4.  Attach product - PRc1 - Save.
    5.  In the action editor - create an action ACT1
    6.  Add Associated Object - PRC1
    7.  Create a modif - MOD1 with effectivity of today
    and spec green
    8.  Send PRc1 to the Product Editor.
    8a.  Associate ACT1.
    9.  Insert a new part instance - PRT1---
    10. Check configuration:
    Effectivity is given from ACT1-Mod1
    Today and spec green
    11.  Lock PRT1--- - usage and reference
    12.  Promote PRT1--- to Approved
    13.  Create a new version of PRT1---, PRT1--A
    14.  At the effectivity popup insert today's date + 2
    15.  Check configuration for new version:
    ON R9 - effectivity is today's date +2
    ON R10 - effectivity is today's date + green
    16.  Close the Product Editor
    17.  Create a new Action - ACT2.
    18.  Add Associated Object - PRC1
    19.  Create a modif - MOD2 with effectivity of Today - 5
    and spec red
    20.  Send PRc1 to the Product Editor.
    21a.  Associate ACT2
    9.  Insert another part instance - PRT1--A
    (I used copy/paste for the new instance)
    10. Check configuration:
    Actual Results
    On R9 and R10 effectivity is given from the Action
    Today - 5 and spec red
    Expected Results:
    Part version cannot have effectivity before the version is
    created (applicable).
