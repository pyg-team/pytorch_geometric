Information Analyzer JR35333 Supports duplicate data source names for a host. Information Analyzer JR35503 If an alternate PX configuration file has been specified, it will be used during the job run. Information Analyzer JR35569 Fixes an issue in the Format and Domain and Completeness screen for certain Database versions.

Information Analyzer JR36373 Can now use TRIM in an in_reference_column Data rule that involves char and varchar columns. Information Analyzer JR36433 Fixes an issue where no values are displayed on the Column Analysis Format tab for a SQL Server or Oracle IADB. Information Analyzer JR36436 Fixed issue that free form rules containing "and/or" combinations and complex expression cannot be opened. Information Analyzer JR36443 Provides user a new option at the Global level, Project level and Job submission time, to prevent Column Analysis of columns longer than 512 characters. Information Analyzer JR36479 Fixes an issue where joins are ignored if none of the columns of the joined table are used in the binding. Information Analyzer JR36480 Lookup on reference tables will now use the filter criteria. Information Analyzer JR36489 In Column Frequency - Most Frequent Formats report, the Y scale in the chart has data truncated to 6 digits; added support for 10 digits. Information Analyzer JR36503 Deleting a data store will now take a reasonable time to complete.
