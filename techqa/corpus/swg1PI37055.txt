APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  (Note: The below scenario can also happen on 32 bit
   Installations)
   You download the 64 bit zip file for release IBM SPSS Statistics
   23 for Windows and extract it to a local folder on your hard
   disc on a 64 bit Windows machine. The name of the file is:
   SPSSSC_64-BIT_23.0_MW_ML.zip.
   For example you extract the content of the zip file to
   C:\Temp\SPSSSC_64-BIT_23.0_MW_ML
   You click Start - All Programs - Accessories and right click on
   Command Prompt and select 'Run as Administrator'
   On Command prompt you change directory to folder
   C:\Temp\SPSSSC_64-BIT_23.0_MW_ML
   Then you run the below command which is also documented on
   Authorized User License Administrator Guide.pdf for push
   installation of release 23:
   
   MsiExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 23.msi" /qn /L*v logfile.txt
   
   ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/s
   tatistics/23.0/en/client/InstallationDocuments/Windows/Authorize
   d_User_License_Administrator_Guide.pdf
   
   You wait until the installer has finished. The program
   installation with MSI went through and the product is installed
   to C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23.
   After MSI install you notice the program directory folder has
   1.12GB, while the size of the folder when using the Interactive
   Installation is about 1.37 GB.
   You launch release 23 either without license, or with temporary
   license enabled manually ar with a proper authorized user
   license.
   When you launch the product you see only the menu File, View and
   Custom but when you click on these menus you see not the full
   content of the normal menus as well. Also no toolbar is visible
   
   The problem is caused by spssprod.inf not filled in with no-net
   on daemon host line:
   On DaemonHost=
   There is no-net parameter:

   Please note that when you edit spssprod.inf manually and insert
   DaemonHost=no-net and save the file, after that launch release
   23 again all menus are available.
   
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS development. It can also
   happen for 32 bit pushed  installations of release 23.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As part of fixing an issue with respect to
   redundant licensing the Daemonhost variable cannot be empty now.
   It has to be either no-net in the case of authorized license or
   license server in case of network license.
   According to documentation you now should use AUTHCODE when
   pushing via command line.
   In order to perform silent installations for release 23 you
   should
   provide either authorization code or network license parameter.
   DaemonHost value needs either one of these to get populated.
   
   See Authorized User License Administrators Guide:
   
   Command line example:
   Following is a command line that you could use to push a product
   installation. Enter all of the text on one line.
   MsiExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 23.msi" /qn /L*v logfile.txt
   INSTALLDIR="C:\Statistics" AUTHCODE="3241a2314b23c4d5f6ea"
   
   For Network License:
   MsiExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 23.msi" /qn /L*v logfile.txt
   INSTALLDIR="C:\Statistics" LICENSETYPE="Network"
   LSHOST="mylicserver"
   
   However, there can be circumstances where using AUTHCODE
   parameter on push installations is not convenient.
   In order to run a pushed installation for authorized user
   license installation without using AUTHCODE like on the below
   example
   
   MsiExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 23.msi" /qn /L*v logfile.txt
   INSTALLDIR="C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23"
   there was Interim Fix developed as well where an installer file
   just populate the file
   spssprod.inf with the value DaemonHost=no-net for customers who
   would not want to change this value manually.
   
   If you encounter the issue described above and would like to
   have the installer file to populate spssprod.inf please open a
   Service Request
   with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI37055
   and technote 1700572 about about Interim Fix 002
   for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
