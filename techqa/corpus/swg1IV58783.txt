PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected
   Component : Target
   Platforms : All ( Windows and Linux)
   Versions  : 9.0.1 and 9.1.0
   
   Problem Description:
   Unmanaged targets (Installed targets with the Managed property
   set to no and On-demand Targets from version 9.0.1 onwards) do
   not report session audit events to the server through the
   broker. These audit messages are still logged to the system log
   on the target machines, but are not visible in the session
   history on the server.
   
   Problem Summary:
   The target was internally configured to only log audit events to
   the server when in managed mode. The On-demand Target is
   affected because it runs in non-managed mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   9.0.1-TIV-IEMRC901-IF0004
   9.1.0-TIV-IEMRC910-IF0003
