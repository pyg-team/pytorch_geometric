APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Application deploy fails after migrating to 6.0.2.17.
   Details:
    Some applications deployment  failed after the upgrade of
   WebSphere to 6.0.2.17 and some of the deploy throws warning
   message.
   1) It worked fine for all the applications on WebSphere version
   (6.0.2.15) and the problem is all the application with jdbc
   resources configured is failing  on WebSphere version
   (6.0.2.17)
   
   2)It's failing at the end of the ressource mapping : map the
   resources,map the authentication, we push "next button" and it
   sends a warning message
   
   warning
   (cf PJ of this mail for the message)  related to jdbc resources.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IBM Websphere Application Server users above *
   *                 6.0.2.17 and above 6.1.X                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When you try to deploy an application   *
   *                      and the target mapings contain both an  *
   *                      Application Server and webserver as     *
   *                      a combination then in the step "Map     *
   *                      resource references to resources"       *
   *                      you will get the error "ADMA8019E"      *
   *                      with message resources out of scope     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When you try to deploy an application and the target mapings
   contain both an Application Server and webserver as a
   combination then in the step " Map resource references to
   resources " in versions later than 6.0.2.17  you receive
   a resource validation error with id ADMA8019E stating that the
   resources are out of scope. In versions later than 6.1 you
   do not find the resources declared at the Application Server
   level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to ignore the server if it is a
   webserver while populating the available resources and while
   validating if the resources are in scope.
