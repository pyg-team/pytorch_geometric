ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On a report migrated from 8.3 to 8.4.1, client gets an
   error:?OP-ERR-0263 Unsupported FOR clause in detail filters. It
   must reflect the left to right order of query items on edge
   'edge="13" 'dataItem=""', 'expression="total([#Managed Client
   Groups] for any [CREW POID] ) > 0"'.??The root cause of this
   error was a summary filter using the expression FOR. The way the
   filter was used would have worked in a report running against a
   relational package, but not OLAP.?In previous versions Cognos
   will allow the usage of relational expressions for reports
   running against multidimensional databases, however that has
   changed in later versions.?The solution was to change the filter
   and use an MDX expression that will filter summary totals. So
   for example, instead of using a summary filter like this
   one:?total([Actual Revenue] for [Retailer Site])<200000??we
   replaced the column edge expression to filter the total
   values:?filter([great_outdoors_company].[Years].[Years].[Year],[
   Total(Retailer?Site)]<200000)??Client
   sees the changes as a loss of functionality and he would like
   to?log a defect or an enhancement to have the same functionality
   as in 8.3?for any migrated reports. In client's words:?" I
   reported back to the team the findings from this PMR, concerning
   the?"loss of functionality" in using relational expressions on
   OLAP data?items.?We are interested in persuing a fix or similar
   "correction" (enhancement?) for Cognos 8.4.1 so our users will
   not be affected by this change.
