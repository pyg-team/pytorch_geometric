PROBLEM
If you are using Ubuntu, Red Hat, SuSE or Fedora and attempt to share your screen you will see the buttons greyed out under the Screen Sharing tab in the Sametime Meeting Room Client (MRC)

SYMPTOM
You are unable to click the "Share screen..." button in the MRC because it is greyed out.


CAUSE
The most likely cause is that the Java JVM code failed to connect to the Sametime meeting native code in the MRC applet. When this happens, itâ€™s usually because the native code is not running.

ENVIRONMENT
Any flavor of Linux with a properly configured Java JVM for the Firefox browser

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that you have the required Linux libraries by opening up a terminal window, and trying to execute the native code directly. Go to <user home>/SametimeMeetings/NativeLibraries, and type in ./<sametime code>, where <sametime code> will have a name with the format stas80_<date>.<buildnumber>-Linux. If you have all of the libraries, the code will execute silently for less than a second. Otherwise, you will see a message indicating that you are missing a required library. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you see a message indicating that you are missing a required library go through your software update channels, either using your update manager or from an RPM or DEB site to find the missing library then install it.




One case this behavior was seen for an Ubuntu 9.04 user. Here is their output:
<user>@<hostname>:~/SametimeMeetings/NativeLibraries$ ./stas801_20080415.2101-Linux 
./stas801_20080415.2101-Linux: error while loading shared libraries: libXm.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


libXm.so.3 is provided in the libmotif3 package. 
It should be available by executing the following command: 

sudo aptitude install libmotif3

The package can also be download from the Debian site:
http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=libXm.so.3&mode=path&suite=stable&arch=any [http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=libXm.so.3&mode=path&suite=stable&arch=any]

If you are running 64-bit Ubuntu there a few additional steps are required. 
Workaround is to download the 32 bit libmotif3 manually from:
http://<mirror>/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/o/openmotif/libmotif3_2.2.3-2_i386.deb

Then install it with sudo dpkg --force-architecture libmotif3_2.2.3-2_i386.deb
And then sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libXm.so.3 /usr/lib32/libXm.so.3

Please note that this method conflicts with any packages which require 64bit libmotif3 and only should be used for closed source coded applications. 

If you still have your MRC open you will need to close it and re-enter the meeting.
