Title: IBM "(2003) All sheets in Excel file appear to be empty" message when reading Excel file into SPSS via File->Open->Data - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to read an Excel file into SPSS via File->Open->Data when I receive the following alert message "(2003) All sheets in Excel file appear to be empty". I know this is not the case. I have tried saving the Excel file as an Excel 4.0 Worksheet, which does read in to SPSS, but some of my variables then show completely missing data. What is going on? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It appears as though you have some variables in your Excel file which may contain data but the data does not appear in the first several cases. Regardless of if you save the file as the default Excel file type or as an Excel 4.0 Worksheet, you will need to enter a dummy case in the first row in the variables where this missing data occurs. You should then be able to read the file into SPSS. Once in SPSS, you may delete these dummy cases.

Alternatively, you may read the file into SPSS via ODBC under File->Open Database->New Query.

This issue has been filed with SPSS Development and we apologize for the inconvenience
