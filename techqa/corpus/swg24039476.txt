Here are the main new features and enhancements in this release: 

 * A new Dashboard tab displays the charts previously displayed in the Portfolio tab, and adds more metrics to assess the current status and progress of an application security initiative. This includes:  * trend of portfolio risk status 
    * the number of applications with open security issues 
    * trend of overall open issues 
    * trend of applications test status
   
   
 * A new approach to create scans consistent with AppScan Standard, for both the security team who creates the templates and for the developers who create the scans. 
 * New built-in formulas include new issues, open issues, fixed issues, and total issues. 
 * Enhancements to issue management: A 'new' classification has been added for issue management. All issues that are scanned or imported from 3rd party scanners and that have not yet been triaged are now classified as 'new' in both the Monitor and the Scans views. 
 * Group issues by Status in an application tab. 
 * New and updated REST APIs [http://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSW2NF_9.0.2/com.ibm.ase.help.doc/topics/r_api_change_history.html?lang=en-us#r_api_change_history].

PROBLEMS SOLVED
 

PI35716 Importing LDAP users fails with "The User Name specified is not valid. User does not exist". PI35580 License expiration warning is not working. PI35464 ASE : Error occurs when associating a job to an application. PI35365 Default Instance is checked by default when multiple instances exist. PI35246 ASE 9.0.1.1: Monitor View column alignment and custom field values missing when using IE9. PI35067 ASE 9.0.1.1: Engine/SDK/Sys logs show different version/build/security rules that the About box. PI34719 ASE: Security Issue matrix Issue count shifts right when Group By Option is used for imported Source assessments. PI34658 False Positive confirmation. PI34434 Invalid characters when importing data from a .csv. PI34134 Scan suspended with out of memory error even in a small/medium site. PI33842 Missing documentation for removing an existing ASE instance. PI32434 ASE: Concurrent sessions get used up and no additional sessions can be granted. PI32335 ASE ME plugin cannot connect to site in proxy environment. PI32304 AppScan flags "Database Error Pattern Found" when characters "sqlnnnn" appear in __ViewState (.NET hidden field).

KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS
 

 * To access the new interactive REST API framework in 9.0.2, the AppScan Enterprise instance name must be called 'ase' (for example, https://<localhost>:9443/<b>ase</b>/api/pages/apidocs.html). 
 * Use Microsoft Silverlight with Internet Explorer 8.0 to properly render Dojo functionality in the Monitor view. 
 * When a scan job only has a recorded login (no Manual Explore or Starting URLs), the scan will not crawl below that page. Add at least one URL to the Manual Explore or Starting URL of the What to Scan page. 
 * If you upgrade a database from pre-8.8, and then click any existing job, the scan log will be empty. Rerun your jobs to generate a new scan log. 
 * When editing the Edit Application Profile Template page in IE 8/9, changes are not saved. Navigate away from the field you are editing and then back to it. Save your changes. Alternatively, upgrade your browser to IE11 or Firefox 31.
