APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) Microsoft (MS)
   Word Utility with RichText() function and bold and color fonts
   in testscript.steps.description, you get a status code 400,
   "Uploaded content does not consist of well-formed XML or does
   not match the XML schema for testscript" and SAXParseException.
   
   
   There is a partial workaround at this time:
   1. Open the MS Word Document file
   2. Select All and Cut
   3. Open a new MS WordPad file (All Programs > Accessories >
   WordPad
   4. Paste
   5. Select All
   6. Paste it back to the MS Word Document file
   7. Use RQM Word Utility to Export to Repository
   
   The test script will be imported, however the words with the
   bold/color are concatenated to the next word.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Issue: Word Import Tool RichText function for test script    *
   * generation                                                   *
   *                                                              *
   * RichText() function in testscript.steps.description gives    *
   * status code 400, Uploaded content does not consist of        *
   * well-formed XML or does not match the XML schema for         *
   * testscript.  See comment 3 for complete stack trace of       *
   * SAXParseException.                                           *
   *                                                              *
   * If you generate the XML instead of importing into the        *
   * repository and look at in Notepad++ or other XML editor, it  *
   * seems one of the problems is that the XML created for the    *
   * "style=..." has double quotes instead of single.             *
   *                                                              *
   * RichText() function in testscript.steps.expectedResult works *
   * as expected.                                                 *
   *                                                              *
   * Version: the customer is using 5.0.1 but we tested in 5.0.2  *
   * too and it has the same problem.                             *
   *                                                              *
   * Steps to Reproduce:                                          *
   * You can use the sample data.                                 *
   * 1. Open the Word Sample "TestScript in Tables.doc"           *
   * 2. Make the Step Description text bold.  Customer is using   *
   * bold and color but the error occurs even just with bold      *
   * text.                                                        *
   * 3. Change the corresponding config file so that              *
   * testscript.steps.description is using RichText function,     *
   * like this:                                                   *
   * testscript.steps.description=RichText(Table(2).B)            *
   * 4. Run the import                                            *
   * Get the 400 error                                            *
