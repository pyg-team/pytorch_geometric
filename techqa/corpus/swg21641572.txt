QUESTION
 Using ITCAM FOR Tx with ISM agent, 07.30.00.00, the agent fails to start nco_m_icmp monitor, with message in logs: "This monitor requires root privileges to run". Is it possible to run nco_m_icmp or nco_m_dhcp for example as "non-root" account on Linux system? 

CAUSE
Some ISM monitors (DHCP, ICMP, TRANSX) must be run as 'root' account because they are using and need specific privileged OS calls. 

There iss another technote that suggested:
For nco_p_ping executable (Tivoli Netcool/Omnibus), setting a setuid is sufficient to run it as a "non-root" user id. 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root admin 82916 Apr 22 2010 nco_p_ping 

But nco_p_ping is a probe, and not a monitor. 

For ICMP or DHCP monitor for example, using only setuid command is not sufficient. When trying to start ICMP nco monitor, you get in icmp.log file the following message : "Error: This monitor requires root privileges to run"

ANSWER
It was confirmed by the development labs that ICMP and DHCP monitors must be run as root because of the type of sockets they create.
