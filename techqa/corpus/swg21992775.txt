 * When performing an IBM Spectrum Protect for Databases, Data Protection for Oracle version 7.1.3.0 or higher backup, a logon will be made to SQLPLUS for a query to the database front end capacity. If the SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES setting is set to NONE within the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora or <TNS_ADMIN>/sqlnet.ora file, this will leave orphaned processes. The Data Protection for Oracle client requires the SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES setting to be set to any other eligible value (not NONE) to allow the "sqlplus / as sysdba" commands to complete correctly.
