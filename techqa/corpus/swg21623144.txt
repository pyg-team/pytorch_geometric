Title: IBM Reboot of the WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance virtual edition needed after disabling a feature - United States

Text:
datapower virtual edition reboot xg45 xi52 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The virtual edition of the DataPower Appliance does not automatically reboot after booting a firmware image. Why is this? 

CAUSE
The 'Boot Image' section can be used to boot firmware images, as well as the activation, enable, and disable tools for added features. By design, the DataPower appliance does not automatically reboot so that several tool scrypt files can be booted to the appliance before having to reboot the appliance.

ANSWER
The virtual DataPower appliance must be manually rebooted in order for changes in the firmware or features to be final. 

The appliance can be rebooted from the WebGUI by navigating to Administration > Main > System Control.

The appliance can also be rebooted from the CLI using the command "shutdown reboot" issued in the base CLI mode. For example:

xi52# shutdown reboot
