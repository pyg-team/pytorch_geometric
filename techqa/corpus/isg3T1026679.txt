QUESTION
 Why do job fail with exit code 255 and job res exit with log "init_res: ls_getmyhostname2() failed. Error 0."? 

CAUSE
Job res fails in host name resolution during start up to cause the job to exit at very early stage.
Example:
bhist -l 1467
Job <1467>, User <root>, Project <default>, Command <sleep 1000>

ANSWER
Host name resolution failure could be caused by incorrect $LSF_ENVDIR/hosts, /etc/host and DNS. Check to make sure they are configured properly. If $LSF_ENVDIR/hosts is not configured, may consider to add it to let lsf use $LSF_ENVDIR/hosts first.
