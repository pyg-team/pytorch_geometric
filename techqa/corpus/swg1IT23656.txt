APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a domain is reset, SFTP front-side handlers are not being
   deleted and are causing referenced objects to be resist
   deletion as well.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SFTP and SSH DataPower Objects Require reference to each other
   internally. This prevents either object from being removed on
   management deletion.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.1.0.22, 7.2.0.19, 7.5.0.14, 7.5.1.13,
   7.5.2.13 and
   7.6.0.6
