Title: IBM Console prompt after intrusion detection erroneously says appliance will start in fail-safe mode - United States

Text:
intrusion detection fail-safe mode 7199 7198 9005 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you reload the appliance after an intrusion detection, the console prompt indicates that the appliance will start in fail-safe mode. However, when you continue, the appliance does not enter fail-safe mode. 

SYMPTOM
With the appliance set to detect intrusion, open the cover. Log on to clear the intrusion switch and reload. You see the following prompt: 

"Error: The appliance was opened, which activated the intrusion switch. Continue the current process will put the appliance in a fail-safe mode. Do you want to continue? [y/n]: "

However, when you choose "y" to continue, the appliance does not enter fail-safe mode.


CAUSE
In some cases, the message that the appliance will be in fail-safe mode is erroneous.

ENVIRONMENT
This error message might occur when all of the following are true:


 * Type 7199 or Type 7198 appliance 
 * Intrusion detection feature is enabled 
 * Intrusion is detected

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When the appliance is opened, which activates the intrusion switch, you must login to clear the switch. 


The following commands trigger the warning message.


 * shutdown [option] 
 * boot config 
 * boot image 
 * boot update 
 * boot switch 
 * boot delete 
 * boot reflash 
 * reinitialize
   

The appliance only enters fail-safe mode for the following commands: 
 * shutdown reboot 
 * shutdown halt 
 * boot image 
 * boot switch 
 * boot reflash 
 * reinitialize

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue has been reported to quality engineering. The message that the appliance will be in fail-safe mode is erroneous and can be ignored.
