ANSWER
 

 1. On the Application Server, locate the file WcmJavaViewer.jsp in the <AE install path>\Workplace.ear\app_engine.war\UI-INF\jsp\ui directory for Workplace or <WXT_install_path>WorkplaceXT.ear\web_client.war\UI-INF\jsp\ui directory for Workplace XT. 
 2. In the P8 WriteParam function section, add the following line: 
    
    writeParam('AllowPrintHeader', 'false'); 
    
    There will be several of the writeParam statements in the P8 parameters section. Add the new line anywhere in this section of writeParam statements.
