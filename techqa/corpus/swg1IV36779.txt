PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On certain platforms and processors, the JVM now starts with
   large pages enabled by default for both the JIT code cache and
   the Java object heap, instead of the default operating system
   page size.
   The following sizes apply to Linux:
       Linux on x86 and AMD64/EM64T: 2 MB large pages
   Note: These changes do not apply to Linux on IBM POWER?
   platforms.
   If the operating system is not configured for the large page
   size, or if the correct hardware is not available, the JVM uses
   the default operating system page size instead.
   You can configure the large page size using the -Xlp command.
   For more information about the -Xlp command, see JVM
   command-line options.
   Note: The use of large pages by default is not enabled on
   WebSphere Real Time for Real Time Linux, V3 service refresh 4.
   Use of large pages by default applies only to WebSphere Real
   Time for Linux, V3 service refresh 4.
