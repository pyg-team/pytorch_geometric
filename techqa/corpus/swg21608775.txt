PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error while loading events in Management Console "Log manager errors. java.io.IOException: There is not enough space on the disk" 

SYMPTOM
When you try to show events in Management Console software, following error message is displayed and operation fails: 

Could not load events due to an SQL Exception.
Error code:60000
Log manager errors. java.io.IOException: There is not enough space on the disk..


CAUSE
This error can happen if there is very large number of events stored on a datastore. When you show events using Management Console software, events are first downloaded to machine on which Management Console is installed. If Management Console software fails to store them, error is displayed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to resolve the problem clear events on a datastore from which Management Console software is unable to load events. 

If error appears while showing Source Replication or Source General log connect to source datastore and run following command: 

dmclearevents -I <instance_name> -s <subscription_name> -S 

If error appears while showing Target Replication or Target General log connect to target datastore and run following command: 

dmclearevents -I <instance_name> -s <subscription_name> -T 

Command dmclearevents can be found in <CDC_installation_directory>\bin directory.
