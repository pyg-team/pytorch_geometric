 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 For the Classic ODBC/JDBC clients...

1) How can I create response file for install?

2) How can I use command prompt to perform silent install?

3) How can I use command prompt to perform silent uninstall?



ANSWER
(1) create response file template

installation_program -i console -r <path><properties.txt> 
example
cac101wn.exe -i console -r c:\temp\cacv101\properties.txt

note: replace console with silent if you want to run without prompts. 

(2) initiate the silent install template

installation_program -i silent 
example 
cac101wn.exe -i silent 

(3) initiate the silent uninstall.

a) cd to where the uninstall program was installed. In my case 
cd c:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\ISClassic101 
b) execute the uninstall exec. 
_uninst\uninstaller.bin
