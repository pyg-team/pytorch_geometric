APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DataPower pattern "Web application with Form-based
   authentication and LTPA SSO" has two AAA policies in the
   processing policy. The first AAA policy generates a LTPA token.
   The pattern does not expose the generated LTPA token key file
   and password to the customer. If the customer can't set this key
    file the created service might not work correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower users deploying the out of the box LTPA Pattern will
   have a non functioning AAA policy because the generate token key
    file is not exposed to the user.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.1.
