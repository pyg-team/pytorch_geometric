ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Automatic numbering has been activated in a product, and
   afterwards numbering is inserted in drawing by the generate
   numbering icon.
   Now, if you afterwards manually change a balloon number in
   the drawing, the number is changed to what you type in. But
   when you update the drawing the number is changed to its old
   value for the first digit followed by what you typed in for
   the second:
   1 changed to 99  gives 19  after update.
   1 changed to 444 gives 144 after update.
   1 changed to 999 gives 199 after update.
   .
   Scenario:
   1. Load sent CATProduct, CATParts and CATDrawing
   2. Activate CATDrawing and double click on the balloon 1
   3. Enter new value 999 in the field and OK -> the balloon
   read 999
   4. Double click in p1 Catpart and change length of example a
   line.
   5. Go to CATDrawing : update is needed.
   6. Update and notice that the balloon number change to 199
