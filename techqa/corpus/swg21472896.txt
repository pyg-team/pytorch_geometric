Title: IBM What version of Java is supported with WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition client - United States

Text:
JVMJ9VM019E; FTE; WMQFTE; java; client; jar files; fatal error TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have installed the WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition V7.0.x client. You try to run the commands and get errors reporting:

JVMJ9VM019E Fatal error: Unable to find and initialize required class java/lang/ Class Object



CAUSE
The WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition client is shipped with some WebSphere MQ Client JAR files. Therefore, it needs a level of Javaâ„¢ which is supported by the WebSphere MQ server. Either Java is not installed or the Java code level is not supported.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to install a supported level of Java. The File Transfer Edition requirements [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/filetransfer/requirements/index.html] page does not list Java versions. 

See the WebSphere MQ requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27012075]page for the appropriate queue manager server platform for the supported Java code levels.
