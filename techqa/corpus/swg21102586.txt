QUESTION
Certain words are reserved for use by the Full Text search engine. What are these words, and how can you search for them in a document?

ANSWER
The following words are reserved keywords for the full text search engine: 

 * 
 * 
 *   *   *   *   * 
            
            
         
         
      
      
   
   

You can search on these words only by placing them inside double quotes, either individually or in a phrase (e.g., "Field properties").  *   *   *   *   * 
            
            
         
         
      
      
   
   

Non-alphanumeric characters used by the search engine are also reserved. Most, but not all, of these characters can be searched for in a document by placing them in double quotes. Due to the number of non-alphanumeric characters available, these are not listed here.  *   *   *   *   * 
            
            
         
         
      
      
   
   

Note that searching on these keywords will produce errors such as "Query is not understandable", "Full text error, see log for more information", or "Empty Search String or Search String contained only reserved words".
