PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users who upgrade to a WebSphere Procee      *
   *                 Server binding or J2EE Connector             *
   *                 Architecture Adapter (JCA) from WebSphere    *
   *                 Business Integration (WBI) Adapters which    *
   *                 uses data handlers                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Data coming from an external source     *
   *                      into WebSphere Process Server can not   *
   *                      be adequately parsed due insufficient   *
   *                      data transformation support provided    *
   *                      with WebSphere Process Server.          *
   *                      Provided data bindings do not perform   *
   *                      the same function as the Websphere      *
   *                      Business Integration Data Handler.      *
   *                      Invest in custom data handlers can      *
   *                      not be utilized in Websphere Process    *
   *                      Server.                                 *

   ****************************************************************
   WBI Adapters provided both a set of productized Data Handlers
   and an public API for developing custom data handlers.
   WebSphere Process Server does not support the use of either of
   these two previous solutions.  Additionally, in many cases,
   there is no equivalent solution provided. This leaves the no
   option other than to implement new custom data bindings from
   scratch.  This is either not possible of very expensive in
   most cases. Lacking sufficient data transformation capability,
   there is no viable upgrade path for customers to move from the
   WBI Adapter to either a WebSphere Process Server binding or
   JCA Adapter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem was resolved by adding a limited support API to
   allow WBI DataHandlers for 'text based transformations to be
   invoked by WebSphere Process Server runtime code. There might
   be a need to write either a custom data binding or a Java
   Component to invoke the WBI DataHandler using the support API
   provided by this iFix.
