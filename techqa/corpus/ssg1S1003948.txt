Title: IBM Understanding System Health Status on IBM Storwize V7000 Unified - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I view system health information and resolve problems using the Storwize V7000 Unified Graphical User Interface (GUI)? 

ANSWER
The Health Status bar in the GUI, located at the bottom-right of the screen, provides a summary of the system health. Green color of the status bar indicates that the system does not have any issues. If the status bar is yellow or red then this indicates errors or alerts in some of the system components.
You can view further details of the errors by placing the mouse cursor over the cross icon to view a list of components that have status alerts, as shown here:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&amp;aid=1] 
Click on the component to view details of the alerts. The Events table is displayed and lists the status of all events for either File or Block components, depending on the type of component that was selected. For example, clicking on a Network error raised by the file modules will take you directly to the File tab of the Events panel. 

You can also access this view at any time by clicking Monitoring > Events and then selecting the File or Block tab. 

If there are a number of unfixed alerts, fixing one alert may affect the status of others. It is recommended to resolve any Storwize V7000 Block alerts before troubleshooting File alerts. 


Viewing File Events 

The Monitoring > Events > File panel defaults to the Current Critical/Warning view. In this mode only the File events that are currently causing the system health status bar to be either red or yellow are shown. 

Historical events which have been previously resolved can be viewed by selecting Show All in the drop-down list at the top-right of the screen. 


Resolving a File Event 

Use the Current Critical/Warning view to show only errors which are currently affecting the system. 

Double-clicking on an event will bring up a panel for the event details: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=2] 

The Message Description is a hyperlink to the IBM Storwize V7000 Unified Information Center documentation for the error code. This link requires the machine you are using to access the GUI to have access to the Internet. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=3] 

The User Response section includes directions for how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. 

Depending on the type of error, the system may automatically mark the event as resolved once the problem has been fixed. However, some types of error may require the user to manually mark the event as resolved once the cause of the problem has been fixed. The materials in the Information Center explain how each type of event should be handled. 

For events which are not automatically marked as resolved, it is necessary to manually do so using the file module status view. 


File Modules (Interface Nodes) Status View 

Note: the terms "interface node" and "file module" are equivalent in a V7000 Unified system and can be used interchangeably. 

Access the file module status view by clicking Monitoring > System Details and then selecting the interface node (file module) which is currently in the error state, indicated by a small red cross in the bottom right of the icon seen in the navigation tree: 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&amp;aid=4] 

The overall status and current sensor states for this node are displayed: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&aid=5] 

File module sensors are driven by events reported in the File Event log. An event can either change a sensor to an Error/Warning state, or it can change a sensor to the OK state (green). 

In the example above it can be seen that in the Network sensor category, the sub-sensor for Ethernet interface ethXsl1_1 is in the Critical Error state. 

Once the cause of the problem has been fixed, if the sensor is still showing an error state, it can manually be marked as resolved by selecting the sensor and then clicking on Actions > Mark Event as Resolved. 

By marking the event as resolved, the sensor status is set to OK and the event(s) which set the status into an error state are removed from the Current Critical/Warnings view of the File Events panel. 

When all sensor errors have either manually or automatically been marked as resolved, after the causes of the problems have been fixed, the system health status bar will return to green, provided that there are no unfixed Block errors. 

Viewing Block Events

The Monitoring > Events > Block panel defaults to the Recommended Actions view. In this mode only the unfixed Block events are shown. Events are listed in priority order and should be fixed sequentially by using the available fix procedures. For each problem that is selected, you can right-click to run the fix procedure or view detailed properties for the event.

Historical events which have been previously resolved can be viewed by selecting Show All in the drop-down list at the top-right of the screen.


Resolving a Block Event

Click Monitoring > Events and select the Block tab. Ensure that you are filtering the event log to display Recommended Actions.

Run the fix procedure for unfixed errors in the order directed by the Next Recommended Action element at the top of the panel:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&amp;aid=6]

When all errors have been resolved, the system health status bar will return to green, provided that there are no unfixed File errors:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003948&amp;aid=7]
