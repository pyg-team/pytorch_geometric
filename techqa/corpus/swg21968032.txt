PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to save solution in IBM Case Manager Builder (Case Builder) 

Open solution file in Case Builder and edit one of the pages, Change the size from 100% to 95% or making changes to the in-basket and click save, it will throw the error:

--------------------
The PE configuration file could not be saved because of the following error: The in-basket settings could not be created in the PE configuration.

The solution data was not saved to the Process Engine configuration file.

See the associated message. Update the solution information, and try the operation again.
-------------------- 

CAUSE
This happens due to the "LOMS_TaskAssignedUNumber" index does not exist in the PE somehow. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The workaround is - After we manually cleaned up or deleted this index value from PEConfig.xml, Solution Save is working as expected. 

Steps as following:
1. Delete the index from PE Config file after check out from FileNet Enterprise Management and check-in back.
Note: If user recreate the Index and Redeploy the Solution then encountered the same error again on Saving the solution. Then it should.
2. Edit the "Legal Operations Management System" solution and go to Properties tab.
3. Edit the String Property "Task Assigned U Number" and change the "Maximum length" value from 64 to 10, 
4. Save and Close the solution and also Commit the Solution.

The issue also reported in APAR PJ43397 and will fixed in IBM Case Manager Builder 5.2.1.2-IF001.
