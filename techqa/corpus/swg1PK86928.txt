APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TEMAGCCollector.log.path is not commented out when
   configuring the DC, so it is not possibile to have a
   non-hardcoded path for the gc log.
   
   A new property has been added for the silent config:
   
   -V SET_TGCCLP="false" - means that TEMAGCCollector.log.path will
                           stay commented out, thus the path to gc
                           logs won't be hard-coded.
   
   When it's not specified, configurator will uncomment
   TEMAGCCollector.log.path, so it's not necessary to specify -V
   SET_TGCCLP="true".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If no GC data is appearing on the Managing Server console, you
   can either comment out the TEMAGCCollector.log.path setting in
   the kwjcd.properties file and recycle the JVM, or you can set
   the TEMAGCCollector.log.path to the same value as -Xverbosegclog
   in the WebSphere GenericJVMArguments and recycle the JVM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Those who want to not hard code verbose GC
   * path and use WebSphere variables in the path.  Also, users
   * who want to specify rolling verbose GC files and some
   * WebSphere Portal users.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * Users need a way to comment out TEMAGCCollector.log.path
   * during silent configuration to make use of -Xverbosegclogpath
   * JVM variable (or equivalent in HotSpot and other JVMs). This
   * is required when rolling GC files are specified, for example.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new silent config option parameter has been added to uncomment
   the TEMAGCCollector.log.path in the kwjdc.properties file.  The
   parameter is:
   
   -V SET_TGCCLP="false"
   
   The "false" value will comment the TEMAGCCollector.log.path
   property.
   
   When it's not specified, configurator will uncomment
   TEMAGCCollector.log.path, so it's not necessary to specify -V
   SET_TGCCLP="true".
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   package:
   
      | interim fix | 6.1.0.5-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_MP-IF0005
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually comment the TEMAGCCollector.log.path in the
   <DC_HOME>/runtime/<server>/<server>.kwjdc.properties file.
