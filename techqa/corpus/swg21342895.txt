Title: IBM Login to Portal failed and generate SOAP error of server_unavailable - United States

Text:
CAM-CRP-0156 CAM-CRP-0277 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Login to Cognos portal after entering details for login will generate a SOAP error page indicating &quot;Server_unavailable&quot;. However login directly with the dispatcher works fine and regeneration of the cyptographic keys does not resolve this issue. The user is using the mod2_cognos.so module and there are numerous cryptographic errors in the gwmod2.log file. 

SYMPTOM
CAM-CRP-0156 Unable to complete a call to the cryptographic provider's wrap function

CAM-CRP-0277 Unable to open the key store file

CAM-CRP-0012 The cryptographic engine is not initialized

CAUSE
File access permission. The webserver user could not access the encryptkeypair files that belong to the cognos user as they do not belong to the same system group and both set of files do not permit system-"other group" access given the umask value.

ENVIRONMENT
The install has a separate gateway on an Aix 5.3 server using Apache as the web server. The user that was used to install and start Apache web server is different to that which was used to install and start Cognos 8. Umask of both the users show a value of 027 and they do not belong to the same system group.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Provide webserver user system group access to cognos installed files (especially the encryptkeypair and signkeypair directory files).
