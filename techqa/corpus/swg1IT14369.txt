APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM PureApplication System users reported that the
   PureSystems Manager (PSM) Service60 was not running and the
   Workload Console is offline or unavailable. The issue auto
   recovered after about 90 minutes.
   
   Another error that may be seen is:
   CWZIP9604W: Service7 failed. The high availability component
     will attempt to recover the service
   
   This service also auto-recovered.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Service60 and Service7 should auto-recover after about 90
   minutes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There was code issuing a kill process command that was
   occasionally using a process ID that had already been reused
   by the operating system, and killing the wrong process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.2.2.0.
