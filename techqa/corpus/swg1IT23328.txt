APAR STATUS

   handshake".

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue: Connection error when trying to make HTTPS
    requests to the Control Center API tool using the Interactive
   Console (via launch page), the following error results:
   Error in interactive console display: "Remote host closed
   connection during handshake".
   Error in Websphere/Liberty message log:  E CWWKO0801E: Unable to
   initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or
   security settings have expired. Exception is
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol
   TLSv1 not enabled or not supported.
   This error only occurs when restricting the web server to use
   TLSv1.2 (i.e. engine.properties contains
   <WEBSERVER_SECURE_PROTOCOL>TLSv1.2</WEBSERVER_SECURE_PROTOCOL>).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix: During engine startup, ensure the WLP
   jvm.options file (located in
   <install>/web/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/jvm.options)
   contains the following property:
   -Dcom.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultTLS =true.  When the value is set
    to true, it has the effect to allow/use TLSv1.2.
