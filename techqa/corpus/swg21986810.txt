QUESTION
 How do I configure IBM Content Navigator desktop to open documents of a specified mime type using a specific viewer? 

ANSWER
Every Navigator desktop has a viewer map associated with it. By
default, it is the Default Viewer Map. The viewer map controls what
viewers are used to open documents. 


 1. Login to the Navigator admin desktop, click Viewer Maps on the left to open the Viewer Maps panel. 
 2. Create a new viewer map for your desktop, by making a copy of the Default Viewer Map or select the existing Viewer Map already assigned to your desktop to modify it. 
    Note that the Default Viewer Map cannot be modified. 
 3. Select the row in the viewer map that has the matching mime type and repository. 
 4. Click Edit to modify this row and assign a new viewer to the target mime type. 
 5. Save the changes to go back to the Viewer Map screen. 
 6. Move up the modified row so that it is the first row in the viewer map, scanning from top down, that matches the target mime type and repository. This is a key step. Navigator will use the viewer
    associated with the first row with matching repository and mime type, scanning from top to bottom. For example if there are two rows in the Viewer Map like this:
    - FileNet Content Manager - Adobe Reader - application/pdf
    - FileNet Content Manager - Daeja ViewONE Professional - application/pdf
    then PDF documents will be attempted to be opened using the Adobe Reader instead of the Daeja viewer. 
 7. Save the changes. Ensure that the modified or new viewer map is assigned to the target desktop 
 8. Logout and log back in to the desktop and the new viewer map will be used.
