APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue discovered when trying to update custom attribute values.
   There are assets whose name begins with a '#' sign.  When
   attempting to load custom attribute values via a .csv into IGC,
   it does not load the new custom attribute values for the assets
   that begin with #, but does load for the others.  The import
   indicates success, but when you browse the asset in IGC, the
   custom attribute values were not updated for all of the assets.
   
   It appears that IGC is treating the '#' sign at the beginning
   of the line as a comment, therefore ignoring the line.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the cells of the CSV file are enclosed with quotes, then the
   import succeeds.  This could be accomplished if a macro was
   created to add the quotes to text CSV files in Excel or in
   OpenOffice, save the CSV as a text CSV.  This also adds the
   quotes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable update CA vals for assets named with #
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Install patch
