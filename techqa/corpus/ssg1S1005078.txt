REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

<Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix 840 MTMs: 
9840-AE1 &
9843-AE1

V840 MTMs: 9846-AE1 &
9848-AE1 A code fix is now available, the VRMF of this code level is 1.1.3.6 (or later) N/A No work arounds or mitigations, other than applying this code fix, are known for this Struts vulnerability 
Note: 
V840 customers must upgrade the code of both the -AE1 and -ACx (whether -AC0 or -AC1) nodes to address this vulnerability. A customer reading this to fix one model type (e.g. –AE1) should look for the corresponding security bulletin which describes how to fix the other model type (e.g. perhaps –AC0) in the customer's V840.
