Title: IBM Messages are not rolling back to input queue - United States

Text:
MQIINFO; rollback TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have two or more destination queues that are connected to the same terminal of an IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) filter node. When one of the queue's maximum depth limit is reached, then the message rolls back, but the other destination queue receives the message. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem will happen only if the catch terminal of the MQInput node is wired. There is no transactional rollback if the MQInput node can propagate to the catch terminal, which is why the message goes to the other destination queue.

If the failure terminal of the MQInput node is wired, none of the destination queues will get any messages in this scenario. Therefore to avoid this problem, you can disconnect the catch terminal of MQInput node and wire the failure terminal to point to a Fail queue.
