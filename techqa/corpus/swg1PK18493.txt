ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer had freshly installed RSA and his installation
   completed successfully .
   His log files showed the profile creation failed . Even though
   the base WAS server installed fine.
   Creating a new profile didnt help him. So I send him the clean
   up instructions for WTE and suggested he re-installs RSA.

   Csutomer uninstalled RSA and followed the cleanup
   
   instructions l.Then re-installed RSA ,
   RSA installs fine , but when installer is insalling Websphere
   test env.
   and reaches 80% he gets the error message :
   
   He said he got this error message when he installed RSA ,the
   first time.
   ----------------------------
   
   java.exe has encountered a problem - and
   
   Details : java.exe Error signature at name java.exe appver

   Mod name
   
   jvm.dll
   
   ----------------------------
   
   Then he lets the install complete and in the end he gets this
   message:
   "RSA installed successfully but WTEv6 failed to install and will
   be
   unusable."
   
   
   
   I checked his install logs from RSA-install-dir\logs directory ,
   
   wasv6_err.log shows this error message :
   
   ----------------------------
   
   The system cannot find the file specified.

   I had him check his Task Manager, he found he had 4 java
   services
   running under his Task Manager-process tab . I had him stop
   those
   services (ClearQuest related, he didnt use them either way) and
   make
   them MANUAL to avoid such conflict issue next time he
   re-installs the
   product.
   
   
   
   He is gonig to uninstall again , follow clean up instructions,
   and
   re-isntall RSA again.
   
   
   
   He is running this install as ADMINISTRATOR OF THE MACHINE and
   does not
   have any access rights issue in this case.
   
   
   
   I need help from RSA/RAD Install team to debug this WTE install
   failure issue to see if we are
   giong in the right direction on this . Does the java core dump
   point out
   something else that needs to be taken care of , in this case.
    - besides
   making sure that no other java.exe processes are running on the
   machine as services (just a guess)
   Csutomer is a field pre-sales IBM REP and needs a response to
   this ASAP
   to get this RSA install going fine ASAP.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  RSA silently install WASv6.  From the description of the problem
   , it happens in the middle of the WAS isntall.  WAS team should
   have more information about it.

   There is information about installing WA
   S manually in the above technote.  If it still fails, you should
    seek information from the WAS install team.
