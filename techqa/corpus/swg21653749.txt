To resolve the issue, check the following: 

1. Ensure that transparent junctions for all the paths for IBM Case Manager are created as mentioned in the technote: Configure IBM Case Manager for SSO with Tivoli Access Manager. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599394] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599394] 

2. Ensure that the options provided for creating transparent junctions is exactly same as what is mentioned in the above technote. In particular, do not use the -j option when creating junctions as the -j option is used for Scripting Support. IBM Case Manager uses transparent path junction and does not need the function of Scripting Support. If the -j option is used then the content-type header for the support.js response will identify it as text/html instead of a JAVA script and result in the error.
