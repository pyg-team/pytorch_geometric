Title: IBM Find IIB and WMB support information on the IBM Integration Bus Support Page - United States

Text:
 NEWS

ABSTRACT
 If you are searching for IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) support information in the IBM Support Portal, it is located on the IBM Integration Bus Support Portal page. 

CONTENT
When IIB V9 was first introduced in 2013 as the follow on product for WMB V8, the decision was made to have a single page in IBM Support Portal. This one page would host information about both products because a large portion of that information was relevant to both WMB and IIB. The WMB Support Portal page existed and the WMB name was already well known. The IIB name was new and not as well known yet. Therefore, the WMB page was used to host information for both IIB and WMB. 

Now, three years later: 

 * IIB is well known across the industry 
 * There is now both a IIB V9 and IIB V10 
 * The last version of WMB, V8, has been announced as reaching end of support on 30 April 2017. 


With these factors in mind, it was decided to introduce the IBM Integration Bus Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_integration_bus] and to retire the WMB Support Portal page. The new IIB Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_integration_bus] will host all the support information for both IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker. 

If you search for WebSphere Message Broker you will no longer find it listed as a separate product. Instead, the results will return IBM Integration Bus. If you select IBM Integration Bus from the list, you will be presented with the IIB Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_integration_bus] and you will find both WMB and IIB information. 

If you have bookmarks or links for the old WMB Support Portal page, redirect URLs are in place to route you to the new IIB Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_integration_bus]. It is recommended that you update your bookmarks and links with the new IIB Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_integration_bus] to avoid any possible problems with the URL redirect process.
