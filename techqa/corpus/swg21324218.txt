QUESTION
 How to setup VxWorks Real Time process environment within Rhapsody? 

ANSWER


 If using VxWorks version above 6.2, Rhapsody framework needs to be rebuilt using the adapter files. 
Below are the steps to configure Rhapsody for a VxWroks RTP (Real Time Process) environment 

 Step1. Extract the adapter files into Rhapsody installation directory. 
Step2. Replace the PRP file Sample_SiteC++ to SiteC++. 
Step3. Run the Rebuild_VxWorks_verNo_RTP_SIMPENTIUM_so_Libraries.bat avaliable under Rhapsody_Installtion_Dir\Share\LangCpp. 
Step4. Develop a simple Hello World Project in Rhapsody. 
Step5. Right Click on Default Configuration, Select Setting tab. 
Step6. Change the Environment to VxWorks_VerNo, Save 
Step7. Build the project in Rhapsody. 
Step8. Connect to the Target Server running by clicking on Code->Target->Connect under Rhapsody. 
Step9. Run the RTP application by clicking on Code->Target->Run 

 Since Rhapsody Supports VxWorks 6.2 RTP, VxWorks 6.2 RTP compiler options are readily available within Rhapsody under Default config->Settings->Environment . Setting the Right Environment and building is all that is required for v6.2.
