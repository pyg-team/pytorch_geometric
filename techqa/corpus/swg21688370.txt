ABSTRACT
 How to implement Content Manager for z/OS Version 8.5 resource manager to use IBM HTTP Server Powered by Apache for z/OS 

CONTENT
Starting with Fix Pack 3, Content Manager for z/OS Version 8.5 provides three options to configure resource manager on z/OS systems: 


 1. Using IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino V5.3, the only option that can be implemented for resource manager before fix pack 2. This option is not supported under z/OS 2.2 and above. 
 2. Using IBM HTTP Server powered by Apache V8.5.5, an option starting with resource manager fix pack 2. 
 3. Using IBM HTTP Server powered by Apache, a base element of z/OS 2.2, an option starting with resource manager fix pack 3. 


The attached Content Manager for z/OS Version 8.5 Fix Pack 6 resource manager readme file provides instructions to enable resource manager to run one of the options that you select. You must follow the instruction in the readme in order to install the Fix Pack successfully. You must read the document and follow the instructions even if you are not changing the IBM HTTP Server implementation, because some items have changed that require active actions for all installations upgrading the fix pack level of the resource manager.  
Note: This readme file supersedes any previous versions listed in the Historical Reference section.

ICMRDDEF.JCL is a text file that replaces the existing ICMRDDEF member. It contains the changes to support this new option. You must either choose one of these two options (IBM HTTP Server V5.3 and IBM HTTP Server V8.5.5) or both options. You also must use this new ICMRDDEF job before running the SMP/E APPLY job for Content Manager for z/OS Version 8.5 Fix Pack 2. 

The prolog section of the ICMRDDEF job provides the options, and instructions for each option to modify this JCL:
