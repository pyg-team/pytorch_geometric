APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I don't know if this is an Actions application bug or a
   Scheduler bug.
   
   The Actions application malfunctions when Scheduler is installed
   for Set Value and other types.
   For different Action Types different
   combinations of the Value and the Parameter/Attribute fields
   should become editable or readonly.   This problem leaves fields
   grayed out (readonly) when they should be editable.
   
   I have reproduced this on the QA Server using this 7116  URL
   with the Scheduler:
   
      http://qawin03.swg.usma.ibm.com:9996/maximo/ [http://qawin03.swg.usma.ibm.com:9996/maximo/]
   
   and everything works correctly on this 7116 URL which does not
   have Scheduler:
   
       http://qaaix08.swg.usma.ibm.com:9999/maximo [http://qaaix08.swg.usma.ibm.com:9999/maximo]
   
   This affects these Action Types:
   
   - Set Value - Parameter/Attribute stays ReadOnly when it
                 should be editable
   - AppAction - Some AppActions like CREATEWO turn
                 Parameter/Attribute editable but this doesn't
                 happen when Scheduler is installed.
   - Custom Class - Value and  Parameter/Attribute should both
                 be editable but only Value is editable.
   
   (I think ChangeStatus is ok, both the Value and the Memo field
   become editable. Command and Group seem ok too.)
   
   Steps:
   1. Go To Actions app  - Goto - System Config - Platform Config
      - Actions
   2. Click on New
   3. Put in a new Action for Workorder (or any) Object.
   4. Change the Type to those listed above and you will see
      how Value and Parameter/Attribute fields change as above.
   
   With this bug they cannot enter new Actions to the database.
