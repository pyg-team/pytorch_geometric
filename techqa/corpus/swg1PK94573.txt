APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TakeEventStatus res = eventNotConsumed;
   if(IS_EVENT_TYPE_OF(OMNullEventId))
         {
             C_exit();
             B_entDef();
             res = eventConsumed;
         }
     return res;
   }
   
   As you can see the transition to A from B will only happen when
   B state has completed. However, the transition to B from C
   happens immediately. If I merge the C sub-statechart, the code
   for C_handleEvent will be similar to B_handleEvent where it
   waits for the state to be completed before transitioning. This
   is only an issue if the state (C) contains an orthogonal state.
   
   Business impact:
   ----------------
   
   Unable to consistently model statecharts; could introduce bugs
   into the software being developed.
   
   
   Issues: termination state code generated and the behavior is
   different for parallel and sub statecharts. Design can be buggy
   if mis interpreted.

   Code generated for the same design differs for parallel and
   substate charts.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the attached model, the sub-statechart is not the only
   difference between state B and state C. B has a termination
   state and C has a termination connector. The difference in
   the generated code between state B and state C is caused by
   the difference in semantics between termination state and
   termination connector. Termination state terminates only the
   state which it belongs to. Termination connector ends the
   statechart and the instance of the class deletes itself.
