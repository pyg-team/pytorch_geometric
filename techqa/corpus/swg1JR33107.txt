ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WPS Release: 6.1.0.0 at fp 6.1.0.3
   
   
   All the environments (Dev, Int and Prod AIX5.3) are single
   server
   configuration. Due server resource issues, we have been
   recreating the
   environments in a new LPAR. These are the high level steps
   followed:
   a) Install WPS 6.1.0.0
   b) Install fix pack 6.1.0.3
   c) Create standalone profile without the BPC Sample
   configuration
   using the wizard
   d) Manually create all the schemas in Oracle 9i (9.2.0.8)
   e) Using Admin Console configure the profile to enable BPC
   (successful)
   f) Using Admin Console configure the Event Collector. This step
   is
   successfully completed, however when the page is reloaded, it
   goes
   back to the default configuration for the schema/user names and
   password. And if I try to change it by pressing the edit button
   and
   save it, Admin Console comes back with an error.
   
   Since we can't wait to address this, and it is not a critical
   component at this moment, I decided to leave the configuration
   as-is
   (with the wrong schema names) and then move on to add the
   Observer app
   and the BPC Explorer app (which were both successful)
   
   I am including some screen captures and logs for your reference.
