PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   P8 Users
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Exception when trying to access an object store in the site
   Preferences: "Problem while sending request or processing
   server response. Exception was java.lang.NullPointerException"
   Steps to reproduce:
   1.Using two FEM sessions simultaneously FEM-A & FEM-B:
   FEM-A - Create a document class (e.g. BogusClass), refresh the
   objectstore then start to delete that same doc class but do not
   click on "Yes" to delete yet.
   FEM-B  - Create an Object Value Propety (OVP) property template
   (e.g. OVPReqClassProp)
   ?    - Create a document class (e.g. "SomeClass")
   adding the OVPNoReqClassProp property specifying BogusClass as
   the RequiredClass but pause before clicking on the finish button
   FEM-A - Click on "yes" to delete BogusClass then immediately
   with FEM-B click on "Finish" to create the "SomeClass"
   docclass.
   The above steps create a class (SomeClass) with a property
   definition (OVPNoReqClassProp) which has a RequiredClass
   property that points to a non-existing (Bogus) class.
   2.Loginto Workplace
   3.Click on Admin--> Site Preferences --> Object Stores
   4.Click on the object store link where the property/class was
   created in step1 above
