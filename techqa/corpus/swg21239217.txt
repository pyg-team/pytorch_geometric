PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have an application running on CICS Transaction Gateway (CICS TG) connecting to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS). Signon fails and you receive messages DFHCE3542 and DFHSN1115 when you connect to CICS TS on a machine running RACF. When you connect to CICS TS running with CA-ACF2, the CICS TG connects to the region and the application runs fine. 

SYMPTOM
DFHCE3542 sign-on is not allowed a the terminal. Your sign-on is ignored.
DFHSN1115 date time applid signon at terminal by user userid has failed. signon is not allowed at a surrogate terminal except by use of the CRTE transaction.


CAUSE
A CICS trace of the working scenario shows [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239217&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies [http://www.ca.com] CA-ACF2 replaces the SIGNON that checks to see if the transaction is on a signon capable terminal. In this case, the user is coming in on an APPC link. CA-ACF2 intercepts CICS' DFHSNP and calls DFHUSAD directly to do ADD_USER_WITH_PASSWORD. When RACF is being used the SIGNON command is not being replaced.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On the RACF region, you can do one of the following:


 * Use the EXEC CICS VERIFY command to verify the user 
 * Perform auth checking before the user comes into CICS 
 * Use the CICSTERM process


Unlike the SIGNON command, VERIFY PASSWORD does not depend upon the principal facility, so you can use it when the facility is an APPC session. RELATED INFORMATION
