PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Process Designer in Case Manager Builder does not load for an environment configured with Single Sign On (SSO) using CA eTrust SiteMinder. 

SYMPTOM
In an IBM Case Manager development environment that is configured with Siteminder SSO, Case Manager Builder does not load Process Designer. 

No error message is displayed in Case Manager Builder, but an error message is displayed in the Java console. The error message is similar to the following message:
Exception in thread "thread applet-filenet.vw.apps.designer.VWDesignerApplet-1" org.apache.xerces.parsers.ObjectFactory$ConfigurationError: Provider <!DOCTYPE html> not found

CAUSE
UseHTTPOnlyCookies value was set to 'Yes' on the SiteMinder Web Agent. The default value was 'No'.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the UseHTTPOnlyCookies value to 'No' on the SiteMinder Web Agent. However, verify that setting this value to 'No' does not cause any issues such as security and compatibility issues.
