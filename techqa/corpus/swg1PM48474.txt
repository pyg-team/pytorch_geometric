 *  Building apriori model with fields that contain ampersand
   characters in their name allows a model to be generated and used
   to score data. When the stream is saved and a reload attempt is
   attempted an error is displayed and the stream cannot be loaded:
   
   "the reference to entity "H" must end with the ';' delimiter.".
