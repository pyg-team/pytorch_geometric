PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 License Activation Wizard for IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 crashes sometimes before users can enter the Authorization code.


ENVIRONMENT
MAC OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As a workaround, use the LicenseActivator utility from the Terminal application with Administrator rights while connected to the internet:

1.Open the Terminal.app
2. Browse to the /bin directory of the Statistics 24 installation: 


cd /applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/SPSSStatistics.app/contents/bin 


3. Enter the following command: 


sudo ./licenseactivator <your authorization code> 

 

whereas <your authorization code> needs to be replaced with the 20-digit authorization code you received for licensing.
