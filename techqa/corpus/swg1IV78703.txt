 *  Program signature violation while kmq starts on IBM iSeries
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Program signature violation while IBM i MQ Agent starts on IBM
   ISeries. During initialization, LIBKT1KRA points to library
   (i.e.  directory) QAUTOMON, which is the correct location for
   the IBM i OS agent, but not for the IBM i MQ Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  On IBM i, the LIBKT1KRA object is not shared.  The OS agent and
   MQ agent each ship their own complete TEMA. The problem arose
   when MQ was making a fix which changed the LIBKT1KRA
   "signature".  They thought they were pointing to the TEMA
   version they were shipping, but it turns out that the
   initialization code was hard coded to point to the OS agent
   location.
   
   The fix was to retrieve the job information to see which
   LIBKT1KRA location should be used.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
