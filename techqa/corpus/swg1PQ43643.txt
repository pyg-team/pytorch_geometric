   The following message had been issued at customer  site using
   PIF programs:
   CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE EQQDDHDL EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   In consequence the GS-Task terminated  every  4  minutes. The
   related message was
   EQQG004E AN ABEND OCCURRED IN GENERAL SERVICE SUBTASK, IT  IS
            RESTARTED AT CLEANUP.
   After the controller had been cancelled, the problem has gone.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Abend  0C1  occurred  in the module EQQGSDIC (base level)
   on offset X'104' trying  to load (SVC 8) the module EQQDDHDL.
   The  problem  occurred  because  the  module EQQGSDIC deletes
   wrongly the module EQQDDHDL  previously loaded. Now, EQQGSDIC
   has been changed in  order  to  delete  properly  the  module
   EQQDDHDL. Moreover,  the  EQQYTOPX  of  OPC  2.1.0  has  been
   corrected so that it doesn't call the GSDIC module if the GUI
   is not used.
