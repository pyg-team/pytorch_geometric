Title: IBM Steps to take when dependency resolution fails in the Red Hat patching solution - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM BigFix Patch Error: Multilib version problems found. 
Take these steps when dependency resolution fails in the Red Hat patching solution. 

SYMPTOM
The action returns with the status of <error> in the console. 

The dependency resolution logs [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/296392/how-do-i-collect-dependency-resolution-logs-from-a/] contain something similar to the following:
*******************
Error: Multilib version problems found. This often means that the root
cause is something else and multilib version checking is just
pointing out that there is a problem.

Eg.:
1. You have an upgrade for libipa_hbac which is missing some
dependency that another package requires. Yum is trying to
solve this by installing an older version of libipa_hbac of the
different architecture. If you exclude the bad architecture
yum will tell you what the root cause is (which package
requires what). You can try redoing the upgrade with
--exclude libipa_hbac.otherarch ... this should give you an error
message showing the root cause of the problem.

2. You have multiple architectures of libipa_hbac installed, but
yum can only see an upgrade for one of those architectures.
If you don't want/need both architectures anymore then you
can remove the one with the missing update and everything
will work.

3. You have duplicate versions of libipa_hbac installed already.
You can use "yum check" to get yum show these errors.

...you can also use --setopt=protected_multilib=false to remove
this checking, however this is almost never the correct thing to
do as something else is very likely to go wrong (often causing
much more problems).

Protected multilib versions: libipa_hbac-1.13.3-22.el6_8.4.x86_64 != libipa_hbac-1.12.4-47.el6_7.8.i686
******************* 

In this example, the libipa_hbac could not be updated via dependency resolution and requires manual intervention.


CAUSE
Dependency resolution could not resolve a specific dependency needed to complete the installation of a patch update on a Red Hat machine.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problematic libraries need to be updated manually. This can be done on the network by running the necessary YUM commands to install the needed package(s). 

BigFix does provide the ability to deploy RPM packages via the RPM Deployment Wizard in the Linux RPM Patching site. 

You can get to this wizard in the console by navigating to All Content > Sites > External Sites > Linux RPM Patching > Wizards > RPM Deployment Wizard: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21989828&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21989828&aid=1]

The wizard will walk you through creating a deployment task for you to take action on.
