APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the same Queue Manager Object is used for both
   the frontside
   and backside service with Unit of Work enabled and the
   "Transactional=true;sync=true" tag in the backend MQ URL, the
   connection will leak and the message will be uncommitted in the
   GET queue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  By using two separate instances of the MQ Queue Manager Object,
   the connections are managed and this problem does not occur.
   
   Further, if "sync=true" is only used in the MQ URL tag, this
   problem is not visible even if one instance of Queue Manager
   Object is used for both frontside and backside service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  MQ connection leak happens under load when front side handler
   and backend URL use the same connection with "Unit of
   Work" enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This change will be in 3.7.3.9.
