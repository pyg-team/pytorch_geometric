QUESTION
 I cloned, or created a new application, why do I see this error message when submitting an ad-hoc report to run? 

ANSWER
Please refer to "V75_QBR_Ad Hoc Reporting.pdf", section "3.2.8 Adding QBR Functionality to New or Cloned Applications:
Some applications may not be enabled for Ad Hoc reporting out of the box because they may be administrative intensive, a non-standard application or may utilize complex methods for determining its main table. Examples of some of the applications not enabled for Ad Hoc reporting include Sets, Currency Codes, Exchange Rates, and Self Service applications..."

You can download this guide by going here [www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21498285].


This, basically, states that not all applications are capable of having QBR enabled. Also, the View SR app does not have a Create Report option so the button should not appear on the Report List. In older Maximo versions you may still find this discrepancy in very few applications, but that issue was remediated with APAR IV66792.
