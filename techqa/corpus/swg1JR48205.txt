APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you start a BPD in an inactive snapshot, the snapshot is
   silently made active.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM BPM silently activates a snapshot if a BPD from this
   snapshot is started. The correct behaviour is to allow running
   instances in deactivated snapshots to run to completion, and to
   prevent new instances in deactivated snapshots from being
   started from the portal or by an API call. However, the Process
   Designer should still be able to playback instances in
   deactivated snapshots.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is/will be available for IBM BPM that rejects the start
   of BPD instances in deactivated snapshots unless the request
   originates in the Process Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Not applicable
