CAUSE
IBM Business Process Manager Advanced - Process Server has the capability to create a profile during a binary installation process. You can include the wps.profile.feature property in the silent installation response file, which attempts to create a profile after installing the product.

The following table lists the properties that are available for a silent installation. 

Property Description wps.profile.feature Creates a Process Server development profile (qbpmaps) for a test environment. esb.profile.feature Creates a WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus development profile (qesb) for a test environment. user.bpm.admin.username Specifies a user name for the administrative console. The default value is admin. This property is needed only if you are creating a profile. user.bpm.admin.password Specifies a password for the user.bpm.admin.username value. The default value is admin. This property is needed only if you are creating a profile. 
To create a profile, you must set the administrative user name and password. Without these values, the installation fails with the previously listed errors. The following code is a snippet from a sample response file:

- <profile installLocation="${INSTALL_LOCATION}" id="IBM Business
Process Manager Advanced Process Server ">
<data key="eclipseLocation" value="${INSTALL_LOCATION}" />
<data key="cic.selector.nl" value="en" />
<data key="user.import.profile" value="false" />
<data key="user.select.64bit.image,com.ibm.websphere.ND.v70"
value="false" />
- <!--
###################################
<data key='user.bpm.admin.username' value='admin'/>
<data key='user.bpm.admin.password' value='admin'/>
#####################################

-->
</profile>

<install modify="false">
<offering profile="IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Process Server" version="7.5.1001.20120915_1230" id="com.ibm.ws.WBPMPS"
features="wps.client.feature,wps.server.feature,wps.profile.feature,esb.profile.feature"/>
</install>


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Edit the response file and remove the xml comments "- <!--", and "-->" around the user.bpm.admin.username and user.bpm.admin.password data keys.
    
    
 2. Enter the desired WebSphere administrator user name and password for the new profile. For example:
    
    
    <data key='user.bpm.admin.username' value='admin'/>
    <data key='user.bpm.admin.password' value='admin'/>
    
    

Alternatively you can remove the wps.profile.feature and esb.profile.feature properties from the response file under the <Install> section. Then, you can create the desired profile after the binary installation RELATED INFORMATION
