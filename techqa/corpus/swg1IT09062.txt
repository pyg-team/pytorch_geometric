APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The current behavior of a WSDL import into an Application or
   Library is that all WSDL files referenced in the
   wsdl:import/include are imported into the supplied folder. So if
   there are multiple WSDLs with same name but at different path
   locations in the context of import, then such WSDL files are
   named with a monotonically increasing index number suffixed to
   the file. For example, if there are multiple my.wsdl in the
   context of import, then these will be named as my1.wsdl,
   my2.wsdl , my3.wsdl in the supplied folder.
   
   The documentation needs to be updated to describe the above
   behavior.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0 or IBM
   Integration Toolkit who import WSDLs into applications or
   libraries.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If a WSDL, that includes/imports multiple other WSDL files that
   have the same or different namespaces, is imported into an
   application or library, the user will notice in the application
   or library root folder (or specific folder provided by the user
   on the WSDL import page), WSDL files of same name with
   monotonically increasing number appended to them. This is not
   described in the product documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated to describe the
   current behavior of the WSDL importer into an Application or
   Library. All WSDL files referenced in the wsdl:import/include
   are imported into the supplied folder. So if there are multiple
   WSDLs with same name but at different path locations in the
   context of import, then such WSDL files are named with a
   monotonically increasing index number suffixed to the file.
   
   For example, if there are more than one my.wsdl in the context
   of import, then these WSDL files will be named as my1.wsdl,
   my2.wsdl, my3.wsdl, etc in the supplied folder.
