Title: IBM Effect of Leap Second with Sterling Gentran:Server products - United States

Text:
leap second; leap seconds TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How will the occurrence of Leap Second impact Gentran software? 

CAUSE
A leap second is a one second adjustment that is applied to UTC time to remain consistent with atomic time. Occasionally a second is added or removed from a day so that time differences between the two time measurements never exceed 0.9 seconds. On December 31, 2016, during the last second of the day, a new leap second will be added to global time.

ANSWER
During numerous validations that are performed over the years, we have not encountered an issue. There have been several leap seconds over the years through the history of Sterling Gentran:Server (that is, Dec 2008, June 2012, June 2015) and customers have never encountered an issue in their production environments.
