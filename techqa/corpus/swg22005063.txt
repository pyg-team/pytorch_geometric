Title: IBM WEX 11.0.2 Analytical Components administration console is not loading properly in
IE11 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the ICA (IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search) upgrade from 3.0.4 to WEX (IBM Watson Explorer, Analytical Components) 11.0.2, The WEX AC Administration Console (ESAdmin UI) is not working properly in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE). It is not loading any collection details and any other details in other tabs as well. 

SYMPTOM
ESAdmin administration console is not loading properly in IE


CAUSE
In fact, the ESAdmin UI does load correctly in IE v11 and all supported browsers. The issue is most likely to happen when running a lower version of IE with emulation mode set to IE11. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ESAdmin application was developed and tested with IE9. To accommodate all ensuing IE releases, we set "IE=9" as the value for the "X-UA-Compatible" header. In other words, IE 9 mode is correct and intended for the ESAdmin UI.



Changing the emulation mode to "edge", or any other mode will override the product header, thus producing unknown results. Please revert it to IE=9 when using ESAdmin UI, or do nothing with the emulation mode, and allow the header to set it.

Note that the other user applications bundled with the product do not have this header.
