 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document details the new and changed functionality of InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager. 

CONTENT
Version 3.1 of InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager provides improvements and enhancements in the following areas: 

Understanding your environment
Configuration tracking and comparison
Managing the server environment
Managing the client environment
General product and usability enhancements


Understanding your environment Show pureScale member and member subset information (new for DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows) Adding to the DB2 for z/OS support that was introduced previously in the product, this release of InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager adds pureScale member information support for DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows databases that are version 10.5 and higher. To understand the topology of the pureScale instances that are deployed in the enterprise, you need to view all of the pureScale members and member subsets in one place. This information helps you to understand not only the architecture of each member in a group, but the overall architecture of the group. Configuration tracking and comparison Configuration management job improvements You can now compare two or more database or subsystem configurations. When you compare these configurations, you can compare previous versions to the current version, or you can compare the current version to another database or subsystem. You can also compare client configurations. This release also adds more objects to track: 

 * DB2 for z/OS:  * PTF levels
    * Buffer pools
   
   
 * DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows:  * Buffer pools
    * Configuration parameters across all partitions
    * Generic key value type parameters
    * Registry variables
    * Event history objects
   
   

Configuration compare job improvements  * Mapping rules: you can specify mapping rules in the Include and Exclude tab of system configuration management jobs. Mappings are used to specify the source-to-mapping for schemas, tables, and columns. When you specify these mappings, you can also save the mappings. These mappings are saved for each user and cannot be viewed by other users. However, you can use these mappings in future jobs. Any time that you modify a mapping that is shared between jobs, the mapping is updated for every job that uses that mapping.
 * Additional objects to track: You can now learn more about the configuration changes to your databases and subsystems. Additional database and subsystem objects, authorization objects, and discovery objects were added to the list of objects to monitor. You can edit the included objects by opening the job on the Job Manager page.
 * Select multiple targets: You can now select multiple targets for client configuration management and system configuration management jobs. Open the job in edit mode on the Job Manager page and add more targets in the Target tab. Because system configuration management jobs can now gather data for multiple targets, the generated reports for these jobs now contain information for all of those targets.
   
   
 * Include and exclude properties: You can also include and exclude properties for each client configuration management and system configuration management job. Add the other targets to each configuration management job from the Job Manager page by editing the job and including or excluding the objects on the Include and Exclude tab. For example, if you wanted to exclude all tables that contained the phrase TEST, create a new exclude action for tables and specify %TEST% in the value field.

Email-based alerts You can opt to receive email notifications of alerts. Managing the server environment Application profile management improvements You can now clone the application profiles that you create by opening the Manage Application Profiles page, selecting an application profile, then clicking Clone. The cloned profile opens, and you can save the profile or exit from the screen before the profile is saved. View the history of changes To audit your systems, you can now view the history of changes that are made to your application profiles, zParms (DB2 for z/OS only), and aliases. Managing the client environment Isolate application transactions (new for DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows) Adding to the DB2 for z/OS functionality that was added previously, you can now isolate resource-heavy applications for pureScale systems that use DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows version 10.5 or higher. Move an application, a group of applications, or a workload within an application to a pre-configured database alias (penalty box) of a specific data sharing member subset. You can send applications on members or subsets of members to the penalty box. Handle longer client information fields (DB2 for z/OS) You can enter longer values in the client information field in the Isolate application transactions and Map Workload Manager Service Classes client rules for DB2 for z/OS. You should also be able to see longer values in the client information field of the managed client if the client application has set longer fields. Show statistics for a WebSphere® Application Server client From the Managed Clients page, you can view connection pool statistics for WebSphere Application Server clients if they are available. These statistics include the connection pool size, the number of free connections, the number of connection requests, and the total pool wait time. The statistics for a data source are collected while the data source is being used. View the statistics by selecting a client on the Managed Clients page and clicking Show Statistics. When you view the statistics, you can create a Configure WebSphere Connection Pool rule. You can manage how often these statistics are gathered from the Clients tab on the Preferences page. Redirect applications without recycling the WebSphere Application Server Improving upon the application redirection built into previous versions of the product, the web client can now switch connections automatically. You no longer need to recycle the WebSphere Application Server before the changes take effect. Enforce driver and data source properties and registers Now you can enforce any driver or data source property from a central location. You configure the driver or application properties rules; the change is pushed down to thousands of clients if necessary. InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager enforces those properties for you. You can also centrally manage and enforce your special registers. You can also centrally manage and enforce your registers. You can use InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager to tune your applications to run on Netezza® and leverage the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (DB2 for z/OS only), providing decision makers with more immediate answers to their business insight questions.

General product and usability enhancements Database management improvements When you add or edit a connection, you can now validate the access to the stored procedures and functions that are used by the product. Add or edit the connection, then use the Feature Validation tab of the Configuration Management page to validate the access. You can now also view the history that is available for the tasks and jobs that support history. Use the History tab of the Configuration Management page to view the history of all tasks that were performed for that database.

Security enhancements Use your web console ID and password to manage application profiles and aliases and define zParms. You can modify this preference on the Preferences page in the Managed Connections tab. You can create, edit, clone, activate, or delete rule sets for a database only if you have the Is Database Owner privilege for that database.
