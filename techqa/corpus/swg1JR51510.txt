APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an action is performed via a REST call that is either
   triggered by a user that was newly registered in a federated
   repository (using an LDAP server), or mentions such a new user,
   synchronization of external users and groups with IBM Business
   Process Manager is triggered if this new user is not yet known
   to IBM Business Process Manager.
   This behavior is not explicitly documented in IBM BPM v8501
   InfoCenter at:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/SSFPJS [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/SSFPJS]
   _8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/adminguide/topic/managing_users_ex
   ternal.html
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The synchronization of new users and groups via REST calls is
   not mentioned in IBM BPM v8501 InfoCenter. The reported behavior
   however is working as designed.
   Simply, as an example, when a task is made ready for execution,
   the task is assigned to some group / team by IBM Business
   Process Manager. A user, that is part of that group / team, but
   not yet found in IBM Business Process Manager, is created in IBM
   Business Process Manager after the synchronization with a
   federated repository (using a LDAP server) completes, triggered
   by the fact that this user was not yet known to IBM Business
   Process Manager. If this synchronization would not be done, the
   task could not be assigned to that user. Having said this, this
   synchronization is done only once.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The synchronization of new users and groups via REST calls is
   not explicitly mentioned in IBM BPM v8501 InfoCenter, however
   required to allow for proper process instance navigation. The
   reported behavior is therefore working as designed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  End users simply need to accept that IBM Business Process
   Manager performs a synchronization with a federated repository
   (using a LDAP server) if a new user is not yet known to IBM
   Business Process Manager.
