PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Yantra 5x : ORA-600 Error : App not working anymore in EAR / Weblogic deplyment mode 

SYMPTOM
I get no description but my application, which used to run in weblogic does not anymore (even when I try to load my .EAR file that works everywhere else I try). It fails on this a couple of times when trying to load the app. After reading the error codes online for this (it says to call Oracle for a correct interpretation) I think I've come to the conclusion I need to reinstall Oracle but wanted to see if anyone here has any experiences with this error first. I'm runnin on WIN2k with Oracle 9.2.0.1 and weblogic 6.1 SP3.

PART: Platform-Installation 5.0 SP1 Platform
PRODUCT: Logistics Management
COMPONENT: Other
OS: All - All
DATABASE: Oracle - 9.2.0.1
WEB SERVER: WebLogic - 6.1 SP3
WEB BROWSER: Internet Explorer - 6.0


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Resolution :
Referencing the oracleDriver.zip by placing it before the weblogic.jar file and that fixed my problem of launching the Yantra app

Background : 
An ORA-600 is just a catch all error for Oracle when something "bad" happens and there wasn't an appropriate Oracle error number assigned. There are usually additional numbers after the ORA-600 in square brackets. Look up that ORA-600 and the number in the square bracket in metalink. Example : 
Sample : ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [kkslhsh1], [101], [], [], [], [], [],[] 
==> Additional code to search on Metalink would be ORA-600 and kkslhsh1

There are many things that can cause ORA-600. 
One of the most common cause is incompatible JDBC driver. 
Look at your classpath and make sure that you have specific a valid JDBC driver (.zip) before weblogic.jar. The weblogic.jar has its own JDBC driver.
