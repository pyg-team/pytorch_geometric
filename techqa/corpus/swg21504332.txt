QUESTION
 Is the CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0, that was available with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1, compatible with CICS TS V4.2? 

ANSWER
No, the CICS TS Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0 is not compatible with CICS TS 4.2. This is because V1.0 of the feature pack has environment variables set for using the 31bit JVM and CICS TS 4.2 only uses a 64bit JVM.

You must use CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.1 with CICS TS V4.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21566483] and CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0 with CICS TS V4.1.

Do *NOT* attempt to deploy the V1.0 Dynamic Scripting Feature Pack into your CICS TS V4.2 environment.
