Title: IBM User wanted to know where to find license information in SPSS/Statistics - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I've run the license authorization wizard in SPSS, but I would like to know what the license number is that the authorization wizard and code generated. Is there anywhere I can find that? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The LSERVRC file contains the actual license code or codes that were generated from the authorization code and wizard. You may open this LSERVRC file in any text editor application. 

The long text string up to but not including the "#" character is the license code. Everything after the # is considered a comment.
You may get separate license codes for separate modules, and all those codes will be displayed in the LSERVRC file.

The LSERVRC file is located in the installation directory of SPSS/Statistics and in the <install directory>/bin folder of Clementine/Modeler.
In the Mac OS, the LSERVRC is located in the /bin folder after viewing the Package Contents of the spss16.0.app or paswstatistics18.0.app
