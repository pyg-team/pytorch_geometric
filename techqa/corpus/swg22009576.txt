VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-12617 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12617]
DESCRIPTION:Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to an error when running on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload a JSP file and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132484 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132484]for the current score
