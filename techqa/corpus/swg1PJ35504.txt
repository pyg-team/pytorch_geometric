ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   Description of Problem (full details)
   The customer first experienced issues with the ProcessWIP and
   in an attempt to resolve they decided to reinstall the Process
   Analyser software.
   After the reinstall they were able to see events that were sent
   to they Inboxes but not to certain queues. After further
   analysis we could see that it was not recognising the other
   Event logs.
   Following is an excerpt from vwtool detailing the Event logs
   that the customer has:
   Event Log   Physical Table     Event Log
   Name    Name      ID
   --------------   --------------     ---------
   DefaultEventLog   VWLog1_128     0
   ACH_Reclamations_EventLog VWLog1_195     1
   Derivatives_Collateral_EventLog VWLog1_196     2
   The pa.log only shows that it was obtaining information from
   the DefaultEventlog only:
   2008/12/31 13:59:01 [filenet.pa.datacollector.EventDispatcher -
   1] DEBUG datacollector filenet.pa.datacollector.LogAgent
   useLogQuery Query VWVL1_DEFAULTEVENTLOG with Identity 8578
   2008/12/31 13:59:01 [filenet.pa.datacollector.EventDispatcher -
   1] DEBUG datacollector filenet.pa.datacollector.LogQuery
   query start query
   2008/12/31 13:59:01 [filenet.pa.datacollector.EventDispatcher -
   1] DEBUG publisher  filenet.pa.publisher.PublisherQueue flush
   ENTER
   The inspectpa output shows that in the X_PAPEEventState table
   it only lists the DefaultEventlog also:
   PAPEEventState_key RegionId EventLog
   
   0    1
   VWVL1_DEFAULTEVENTLOG
   
   
   
   
   (1 row(s) affected)
   We asked that the customer check that the user they are
   attempting to connect to the PE Oracle database has permissions
   to all the vw tables.
   They granted the user - select any dictionary - access but
   still saw the issue. I asked that they run a SQL query to see
   if the user can see all vw tables. (Please see attached
   output.) The user is able to see all vwlog tables.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? : It
   started to occur after the customer reinstalled PA.
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : no
   Is there a workaround? : not at this time.
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   They are unable to receive all events from the PE server to PA.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  N
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   I tried creating a custom Event log in my system but in my case
   the custom Event log can be seen.
   Steps to Reproduce: (only on customers system)
   - Create a customer Event log and Roster in Config console and
   save the changes.
   - Create a simple Workflow and use the newly created Event log
   and Roster.
   - Transfer the workflow.
   - Notice in the customers X_PAPEEventState table on the PA
   there is no new entry for the custom Event log.
   - Launch the workflow and notice no new events come over
   either.
   Actual Results:
   Events are not being sent to the PA database from the PE.
   Expected Results:
   That all events from every event log be received by the PA.
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s

   What logs were collected and where are they located?

   Inspectpa output
   Configuration/Environment :

   Client OS :
   Database : Oracle 10g for PE and SQL Server 2005 for the PA

 *  The views of custom event logs must exist such that PA can scan
   the views and then retrieve data from its view.
