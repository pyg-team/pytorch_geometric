VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
Description:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.4.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v6.11.5.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v8.1.4.0 and earlier releases.

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf ssh <appname> -c cat staging_info.yml

Look for the following lines:
{"detected_buildpack":"SDK for Node.js(TM) (ibm-node.js-xxx, buildpack-v3.xxx)","start_command":"./vendor/initial_startup.rb"}

If the Node.js engine version is not at least v4.8.5 or v6.12.0 or v8.9.0 your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.5.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v6.12.0.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v8.9.0.0 and subsequent releases.

To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=4.8.5"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=6.12.0"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=8.9.0"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application using the IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack v3.16.1. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
