ABSTRACT
 Working with URL mappings in a virtual portal results in the inability to access the virtual portal via browser or XMLAccess. 

CONTENT
After creating or modifying a URL mapping in a virtual portal, users may no longer be able to access the virtual portal via browser, and administrators may no longer be able to successfully administer the virtual portal via XMLAccess. The issue has been confirmed by IBM Support as a defect and reported via APAR PM47138. 

If you are using virtual portals in your environment, Support highly recommends installing fix pack 2 for WebSphere Portal 7.0 in order to prevent this problem scenario. For those users who already experience such an issue, there are two options for recovery:


1) Restore the Portal database from backup. 

2) Open a PMR with IBM Support to request assistance in remapping the URL context to the virtual portal. Upon opening such PMR, CSV (comma separated value) or similar exports of the following database tables from database domain "release" should be provided for review by Support:

VP_DESC_LOD
URL_MAP_CTX
PORTAL_URL
UNIQUE_NAME
