Slowness; JRE 1.8u60 targeted for next year. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After users update to Java version 8u60, the document viewer starts loading documents very slowly. This issue seems to be limited to Internet Explorer [8 and 11] only. Firefox seems to work just as quickly as before 

SYMPTOM
Users experience slowness with the document viewer in ECM Widget 4.5.2.3 after they have upgraded the Java version to update to Java version 8u60.


CAUSE
This is related to a known Java bug, reported in the following articles:
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134741 [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134741]
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8143205 [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8143205]
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8136906 [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8136906]

ENVIRONMENT
IE 8, IE 11, ECM Widget 4.5.2.3, Windows 7

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To reproduce the problem, carry out the steps below.

1. Create a stored search in WorkplaceXT
2. Create a page in the process space in Business Space
3. Drag Content List and Viewer widgets onto the page.
4. Configure the Content List to use the Stored search and saved the Edit Setting... and saved editing the page
5. Open TIFF images by double-clicking on them.

Note that the difference between loading different size documents seems to be negligible. If you load an image in Firefox and then load the same image in Internet Explorer, it loads about 14 to 15 seconds slower.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Oracle fix for this issue is in JRE 8u72 targeted for next year, 2016.
