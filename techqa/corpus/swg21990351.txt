QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM Host On-Demand on z/OS to use RACF authentication with the Tivoli Active Directory? 

CAUSE
The previous documentation did not include LDBM backend or explicit details to set up this configuration. 

ANSWER
The RACF authentication service on Host On-Demand allows users to log on to Host On-Demand using the native authentication feature available on z/OS. When a user logs on to Host On-Demand, their password is validated against the password stored in RACF (configured to LDAP on z/OS) rather than Host On-Demand password stored in LDAP under the userpassword attribute. 

A check box option is provided on the new/edit user window for the administrator to enable RACF authentication for a new or existing user. By default RACF authentication is disabled. With this option enabled, user can now be authenticated by using the native authentication feature available on z/OS TDS. Host On-Demand administrator can create or edit a Host On-Demand user to be RACF authenticated. 

Refer to the attached PDF document for details on configuration.
