APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rhapsody running on 64-bit Windows system seems to cause license
   server to stop.  License server is running on 32-bit domain con
   troller running matlab license server
   
   
   After Rhapsody on the 64-bit system connects to the license serv
   er, it will run for a while and then the license daemon goes off
   line.  The Rhapsody license service needs to be restarted, but t
   he MatLab license server continues to run correctly.
   
   
   These errors have been seen in the logs:
   
   FLEX server log:
   'lmgrd is not running:  cannot connect to license server system.
     The license server manager (lmgrd) has not been started yet, t
   he wrong port@host or license file is being used, or the port or
    hostname in the license file has been changed.
   Server name:  (server IP)
   License path:  19353@hostname
   Flexnet licensing error: -15,10.  System Error: 10061 WinSock: C
   onnection refused
   For further information refer to the FLEXnet licensing documenta
   tion, available at www.acresso.com\
   
   And in the Rhapsody.log
   License manager starts, licenses start services; (lmgrd) telelog
   ic TCP-port 2446; (Telelogic) TCP_NODELAY not enabled; licenses
   being used, then communication is lost with lmgrd - exiting; exi
   ting due to signal 28.
   
   
   At one point, they did update the drivers on the 64-bit machine'
   s NIC and Rhapsody stayed connected to the license server for ov
   er 24 hours.
   
   
   I have seen reports of other applications having problems with 6
   4-bit Windows and FLEX:
