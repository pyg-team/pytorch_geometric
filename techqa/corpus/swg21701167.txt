QUESTION
 Will the June 30, 2015 leap second impact IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SBI)? 

ANSWER
The leap second that occurs on June 30, 2015 should not have any impact to SBI.

SBI gets the time from the operating system. It is recommended that you check with your operating system vendor to determine if any operating system patches are required.

If any abnormalities are observed, restart SBI after the leap second has occurred.
