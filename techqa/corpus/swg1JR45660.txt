ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Preface:
   - You have opened an item in the single edit item view and
      are editing an attribute of type Lookup table.
   
    - When clicking into the content field of a lookup table
      attribute, the widget for a lookup table entries opens.
   
    - You now are searching for a specific entry in your lookup
      table by entering the desired search string in the
      "Display" field of this widget.
   
    - For the lookup table attribute in question you have
      defined the "display attribute" predicate. The selected
      lookup table display attribute is different from the
      primary key of the lookup table.
   
    - When starting typing the desired search string the drop
      down list dynamically is being reduced to those values
      containing your search string.
   
   
   Current situation:
    - The content of the first matching lookup table entry is
      being copied into the entry field you are entering the
      search criteria, completely replacing the entered value.
   
    - The cursor is being placed into the correct position - but
      the entered search criteria has been replaced with the
      first match in the lookup table. This all happens during
      typing.
   
    - When continuing with typing, the resulting string no
      longer is what you intended to search for; as well as the
      returned search results.
   
   
   Desired situation:
      The search results shouldn't be copied into the entry
      field. This way it would be avoided that the search string
      gets replaced with an undesired value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - Type your desired search string into the display field.
      Simply ignore that it will return "The value entered is
      not valid" after having entered the second or third
      letter.
      Most likely the first or first tow letters will have been
      replaced.
   
    - Now press <Pos1>, <Delete> (not backspace!) once or twice.
      This way you will delete the first or first two letters of
      the search string.
   
    - As a result the drop down list only will contain the
      lookup table entries you initially were searching for.
