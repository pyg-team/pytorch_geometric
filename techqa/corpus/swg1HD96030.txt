ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  P8 Connector returns error "The specified path, file name, or
   both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less
   than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than
   248 characters" when archiving files with fully qualified file
   path that is too long.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the fully qualified file path of a file was too long, the
   file could not be archived, and the FileNet&#169; P8 Connector
   returned the following error message:
   
   The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully
   qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the
   directory name must be less than 248 characters
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This error was caused by a limitation of the .NET API. Starting
   with Fix Pack 3, the FileNet P8 Connector is using the Windows
   API for long file paths instead.
