QUESTION
Is Domino vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638
"The Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 mishandles file upload, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a #cmd= string in a crafted Content-Type HTTP header"

ANSWER
IBM Domino development have confirmed that Domino and XPages does not use Apache Structs and is not vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638

However a customer can create custom applications that use Apache Struts and host these on their Domino server. 
In this case IBM cannot review the code and the customer must complete a review to confirm if it leaves them vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638.
