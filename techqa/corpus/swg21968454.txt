QUESTION
 Using the Managing Server Data Trimmer tool to trim data from the TEXTSTRING table. 

ANSWER

The TEXTSTRING table in the MS octigate database is used to store unique strings from Requests/Transactions. These strings can be a request URL, a method name, a class name, etc.

This table can grow in size over time as it stores Request data. For example if 2 URLs have the same URI part with different parameters, these 2 URLs are treated as two different strings and both get saved into the TEXTSTRING table. Same for SQL queries. Over a period of time, this table can grow considerably in size. The datatrim.sh data trimmer script does not trim data from the TEXTSTRING table. 

If you need to trim this table and decrease its size, please use this attached TextTrimmer tool for Windows. Please download the zip file attached here in this technote, unzip it and follow the instructions in the README file.

(Note: this tool is only available on Windows, so if you're using Unix/Linux please consider using the latest level of the MS code, v7.1.0.4 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960852] or higher at this time.)
