Title: IBM Problems in the POPULATE process, in Offline Forms, when the VALUE function is being used in a date string in the argument. - United States

Text:
TRIOFFLINE; populate TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are some of my cells showing blanks after the POPULATE process in Offline Forms? 

CAUSE
The Apache library that TRIRIGA uses in Offline Forms does not handle the VALUE function where a date string is the argument. 

The following example shows a formula that uses the VALUE function with a date string as an argument. The boldface portion is the portion of the formula that Apache does not like.
=IF(ISERROR(VALUE(MID(B2;10;2)&MID($B$2;5;5)&LEFT($B$2;4)));"";VALUE(MID(B2;10;2)&MID($B$2;5;5)&LEFT($B$2;4)))

Essentially the following resolves to a date string: MID(B2;10;2)&MID($B$2;5;5)&LEFT($B$2;4), and it is being used as the argument in the VALUE function. Apache POI does not seem to be able to evaluate this. 



ANSWER
This is an Apache limitation so it will be up to the user to find an alternate formula instead of using VALUE with a date string as an argument.
