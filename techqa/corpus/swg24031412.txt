ABSTRACT
 This SupportPac contains all the IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1 client components. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
A WebSphere MQ client is part of the product that can be installed on its own, on a separate machine from the base product and server. You can run a WebSphere MQ application on a WebSphere MQ client and it can interact, by means of a communications protocol, with one or more WebSphere MQ servers and connect to their queue managers. The servers to which the client connects can be part of a cluster. 

WebSphere MQ Family Platforms provides a list of the platforms that are supported as WebSphere MQ Clients or Servers. 

An application that you want to run in the WebSphere MQ client environment must first be linked with the relevant client library. When the application issues an MQI call, the WebSphere MQ client code directs the request to a queue manager, where it is processed and from where a reply is sent back to the client. The link between the application and the client code is established dynamically at run time. The MQI is available to applications running on the client platform; the queues and other WebSphere MQ objects are held on a queue manager that you have installed on a server machine. 

Possible Uses
• Why use WebSphere MQ clients?
» Using WebSphere MQ clients is an efficient way of implementing WebSphere MQ messaging and queuing. 
» You can have an application that uses the MQI running on one machine and the queue manager running on a different machine, either physical or virtual. The benefits of doing this are: 
- There is no need for a full WebSphere MQ implementation on the client machine. 
- Hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. 
- System administration requirements are reduced. 
- A WebSphere MQ application, running on a client can connect to multiple queue managers on different systems. 
- Alternative channels using different transmission protocols may be used. 

• What applications run on a WebSphere MQ client?
» The full MQI is supported in the client environment and this enables almost any WebSphere MQ application to be relinked to run on a WebSphere MQ client. Link the application on the WebSphere MQ client to the MQIC library, rather than to the MQI library. The exceptions are: 
- An application that uses global transactions; that is, it requires sync point coordination with resource managers other than the queue manager.
- Get(signal) on z/OS.


» Applications that are built using various programming languages including C, C++, .NET (Windows systems only), COBOL, Java and JMS.
» Applications running within application servers that are certified as having passed the J2EE 1.4 or later Compatibility Test Suite can use the WebSphere MQ resource adapter provided in the SupportPac.

Note: An application running on a WebSphere MQ client can connect to more than one queue manager concurrently, or use a queue manager name with an asterisk (*) on an MQCONN or MQCONNX call. The application has to be changed if you want to link to the queue manager libraries instead of the client libraries, because this function is not available.

RELATED MESSAGE SERVICE CLIENTS
The IBM Message Service Clients offer C/C++ users an Application Programming Interface (API) that is consistent with the Java Message Service (JMS) API. Applications created using these clients can be used to exchange messages between other XMS applications, JMS applications or native WebSphere MQ applications and can easily be migrated between WebSphere MQ, WebSphere Business Integration Message Brokers and WebSphere Application Server V6.0 messaging environments with little or no rework.

PREREQUISITES
This client will interoperate with all the currently supported WebSphere MQ server products, provided the functions used are common to the release of server and client 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
To install a Unix Client:
1. Logon as root, create an empty directory (with sufficient space to receive the download file) and make it current. 
2. Download mqc71_platform to this directory. (Where 'platform' is replaced with a specific platform name e.g. AIX, HP-UX)
3. Execute uncompress -fv mqc71_platform.
4. Execute tar -xvf mqc71_platform.
5. Execute rm mqc71_platform.
6. Follow the instructions provided in the readme file to complete the installation of the client.

To install the client on a Windows machine download the zip file and extract the content. From the Windows subdirectory created run the setup.exe program.

Important information for Windows users
When upgrading the clients installation from previous levels to a WMQ V7.1.0.1 or later level, the mqclient.ini file in WebSphere MQ installation directory is removed. To overcome this problem, please take a backup of the mqclient.ini file from the WebSphere MQ installation directory (by default in C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ) before upgrading the clients using the 7.1.0.1 or later client installer, and copy it back after the install has completed.
