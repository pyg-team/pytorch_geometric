PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why do I get NumberFormatException: For input string: "xxxxxxxxx" when trying to view a Content Manager OnDemand document using IBM Content Manager eClient? 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Manager eClient configured to directly connect to a Content Manager OnDemand Server.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two options to work around this limitation of IBM Content Manager OnDemand Connector.

1. Disable the display value associated with the application group using the IBM Content Manager OnDemand System Administration Client. This can be done as follows:
