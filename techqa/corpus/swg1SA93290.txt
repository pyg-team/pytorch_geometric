ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DLQ handler is not processing messages.  When original q gets
   full, messages go to DLQ.  DLQ handler forwards messages to a
   backup q and when it becomes full messages are left on DLQ.
   DLQ handler ends with a 2035.  This is expected, however, when
   backup q is cleared and DLQ handler is restarted, messages
   on DLQ originally intended for backup q are left(ignored) on
   DLQ.  Handler ends with no messages.  This is not expected.
   This is only re-createable when DLQ handler is run inter-
   actively.
