Prerequisites and co-requisites 

Before downloading FTM v3.0.0.7, perform the following steps: 

- Ensure that your system meets all of the system requirements: http://www.ibm.com/software/industry/financial-transaction-manager/requirements [http://www.ibm.com/software/industry/financial-transaction-manager/requirements] 
This action prevents technical problems that might occur after the installation and configuration of the fix. 

- Review the Flashes and open Authorized Problem Analysis Reports (APARs) on the Financial Transaction Manager product support Web site: https://support.podc.sl.edst.ibm.com/support/home/product/W823356Z48952D56/IBM_Financial_Transaction_Manager [https://support.podc.sl.edst.ibm.com/support/home/product/W823356Z48952D56/IBM_Financial_Transaction_Manager] 
Open APARs describe defects that are not yet addressed in a fix, and they might contain workarounds that will impact your use of FTM v3.0.0.7. 

- Read the "Known issues" section of this readme. 

- You need to have a file system with 200MB of free space to contain the fix files. 
Ensure that you have the free space required to install the fix. 

- If you already have an FTM product installed and have obtained special fixes, contact IBM(R) support to determine whether you need an updated version of the fixes before you install FTM v3.0.0.7. 
This helps to ensure that your system is in a consistent state and that no special fixes are lost. back to Contents 



What's new in FTM 3.0.0.7  * Extended Resend Support Enhancements have been made to the resend capabilities of transactions / transmissions, especially in the context of optimization settings where the logging of some objects may be avoided. 
 * Support for Devolved Timeout Alerts Enhancements have been made to the Outbound Transactions FSM to reduce the number of objects in a timed-out alert state. 
 * Refactoring of the Outbound Transaction FSM The Outbound Transaction FSM diagram has been split into 3 smaller diagrams in the interest of legibility. These diagrams include the Outbound Transaction, Outbound Transaction(Timeout) & Outbound Transaction(Devolved). 
 * Generation of Subflow and ESQL templates. Support has been added to the Model Tooling component to enable the generation of ESQL and Subflow files from an FTM model. 
 * Finer support for control of rollback on an Inbound Mapper abort. Support has been added at the interface(Channel) level to control rollback in the event of an Inbound Mapper abort. 
 * The Purge Utility has been enhanced.

Known issues 
Issue 1 Summary : 

Customers using IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender(WTX) version 8.4.1.2 who use native schema and choice sequence iterations are unable to access iterations of a particular sequence group. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue (APAR PI31636) is available in WTX v8.4.1.3. 

Issue 2 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus (IIB) version 9.0.0.x may experience the following BIP2930E error when deploying or restarting the broker. 

RecoverableException BIP2930E: A function or procedure was called but the value supplied for the ''cAppVer'' parameter was of type ''BOOLEAN'' but the function/procedure expects value of type ''CHARACTER'' Functions and procedures require an exact matching between the data type of values supplied as parameters and the data type in its definition. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue (IIB APAR IT06286) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4. 

Issue 3 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus (IIB) version 9.0.0.3 may experience the following BIP2503E when executing customer flows if propagating from a node after exiting a FOR loop acting on a shared variable. 

RecoverableException BIP2503E: Propagate with a SHARED variable lock held by FOR statement. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue (IIB APAR IT07974) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4. 

Issue 4 

Summary : 

Customers using IBM Integration Bus (IIB) version 9.0.0.5 may experience the following issue: 

If a user has a REFERENCE variable declared at the module or schema level which points at either OutputRoot, OutputLocalEnvironment or OutputExceptionList and performs a PROPAGATE without specifying DELETE NONE in a compute node then it is not defined what the REFERENCE variable will be left pointing at. After the PROPAGATE the Output trees are deleted and the REFERENCE variables should be reset to point at the root of the newly created trees.The module and schema level reference variables are not being reset and are thus left to point at the original syntax element which they were pointing at which will now have been reset leading to unexpected results. 

Resolution : 

The fix for this issue (IIB APAR IT14426) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.6. 

Issue 5 

Summary : 

Customers using any Broker level from v7.x may experience inconsistent validation results when using FTM Channel based validation and/or IIB in ESQL parser validation. 

Resolution : 

IIB APAR IT14075 has been raised for this issue. 

Issue 6 

Summary : 

FTM SWIFT SR2016 WTX maps will not work with FTM SWIFT SR2015 WTX maps at a single broker instance together at the same time. 

The reason is that IBM Transformation Extender has changed the JVCWrapper code with the new Financial Payments Pack for SWIFT 9.0.1 release and it is not compatible with the earlier Pack for SWIFT releases.
Therefore using multiple Pack for SWIFT versions at the same time in a specific instance of a program is not supported. 

Issue 8 

Summary : 

Debulking and Bulking Sample application : 

If the FTM database timezone is set to UTC and the runtime (IIB/Broker) timezone it set to a different timezone then bulking will not occur(ref:55056).
