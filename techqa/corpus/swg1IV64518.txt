APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Custom copy analysis gets automatically enabled on import into
   SCM custom site.
   
   If copied using the Dashboard API's ImportXML() function, the
   analysis is copied into the custom site and automatically
   activated.
   
   This unintended automatic activation can cause performance
   issues in the deployment as endpoints work to analyze the
   copied and activated analyses.
   
   The issue has been fixed in versions of IEM > 9.0.218
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
