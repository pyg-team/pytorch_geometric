PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the number of db connections used by purger/plc and how can you monitor them? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
What is the number of db connections used by purger/plc and how can you monitor them?1) plc has a pool of maximum 20 possible DB connections (all closed at the beginning). The plc itself doesn't use any of these connections, but each time a data loader starts up, it checks out a connection from plc and keeps it while the data loading is taking place. Once the load is complete, the loader returns the connection to plc, which will close it.

2) the maximum number of active connections at any one moment from plc loaders should not be more than the # of EGO loaders + # of SOAM loaders = 4+2 = 6 connections for Symphony 3.13) plc takes care to make sure that connections are closed after use. No connections are kept open if they are not being used.
