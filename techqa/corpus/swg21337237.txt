Title: IBM Setting Upfront themes to default - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have created a new theme. Now I want the new theme to be the default for all of our Upfront users. How do I do this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before you can use the new theme, you must add it to the list of available themes. Once the theme is available, you must have all current users change their own default theme. You cannot change it for them. However, you can set the default theme for any future, new users.

Current Users
For all users that have already logged on to Upfront, they must change their own default theme using the Personalize dialog box in the Upfront user interface.

Future Users
To set a new default system theme for all future users, use the SetSystemProperties XML command. 

Steps to Add a Theme to the List of Available Themes:

1. Open Upfront Server Administration. 
2. Click the Upfront server group icon in the left pane, and then click Properties from the Edit menu. 
3. Click the Display tab. 
4. In the Available Themes box, click Add, and then enter the name of the theme. 
5. Click OK. 
When a message appears indicating that you must stop and then enable all servers to make the new theme available, click OK.
6. To stop all servers, click the Upfront server group icon in the left pane, and then click Stop from the Actions menu. 
7. To enable all servers, click the Upfront server group icon in the left pane, and then click Enable from the Actions menu.

Steps to Set the User Default Theme:

1. Open Upfront, and then log on. 
2. Click Personalize and select the new theme. 
3. Click OK. 
4. Log off Upfront.
5. Open Upfront, and then log on.
The new theme now appears.

Steps to Set the System Default Theme:

1. Enter the following command in your Web browser, where computername is the name of the computer where the Upfront server is installed, and themename is the name of the new theme that you want all users to use.

http://computername/cognos/cgi-bin/upfcgi.exe?xmlcmd=<SetSystemPr operties><Theme>themename</Theme></SetSystemProperties>

2. Choose one of the following:
· If using IE, from the View menu, click Source to see the results of the command.
· If using Netscape, from the View menu, click Page Source to see the results of the command.
If the command was successful, the results returned should be
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" standalone="yes"?><Result><Standard_Result ResultCode="Success"></Standard_Result>
Note: For this change to take effect, you must stop and restart all of the Upfront servers in Upfront Server Administration.

3. Open Upfront Server Administration.
4. Click the Upfront server group icon in the left pane.
5. From the Actions menu, click Stop to stop all Upfront servers.
6. From the Actions menu, click Enable to restart all Upfront servers.
