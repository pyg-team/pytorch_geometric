APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Process Admin Console allows administrators to update user
   attributes either by attribute or by user
   via the Bulk User Attribute Assignment panel (below Server Admin
   area of
   the Process Admin Console,
   click User Management, then Bulk User Attribute Assignment).
   
   In some circumstances, updates using this panel may prevent
   users from
   using Process Portal by updating the
   user's profile incorrectly. There are two known cases:
   1) Assigning an empty value to the 'Locale' attribute via the
   'View by
   Attribute' option
   2) Submitting an empty panel using the update button on the
   'View by
   User' option in an LDAP setup.
   
   In both cases, instead of the empty string a NULL value might be
   written
   to the database for the Locale attribute,
   causing Process Portal to fail loading afterwards.
   
   As a symptom, you may see the following exception in the
   SystemOut.log:
   RestHelper    W   parameter 'locale' must be not null
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: parameter 'locale' must be
   not null

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Process Admin Console allows administrators to update user
   attributes either by attribute or by user via the Bulk User
   Attribute Assignment panel (below Server Admin area of the
   Process Admin Console, click User Management, then Bulk User
   Attribute Assignment).
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   Under some circumstances, updates using this panel may prevent
   users from using Process Portal by updating the user's profile
   incorrectly. There are two known cases:
   1) Assigning an empty value to the 'Locale' attribute via the
    'View by Attribute' option
   2) Submitting an empty panel using the update button on the
    'View by User' option in an LDAP setup.
   
   In both cases, instead of the empty string a NULL value might be
   written to the database for the Locale attribute, causing
   Process Portal to fail loading afterwards.  As a symptom, you
   may see the following exception in the SystemOut.log:
     RestHelper    W   parameter 'locale' must be not null
       java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: parameter 'locale'
       must be not null
     at com.lombardisoftware.utility.i18n.LocaleUtils.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After installing the fix, Process Portal will tolerate NULL for
   the locale, and just picks the default locale then.  Process
   Admin wrote attributes that weren't changed. Now only values
   that were changed are written to the DB.
