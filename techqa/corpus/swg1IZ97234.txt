APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description: Changing the date/time of a future
   scheduled report
   to a scheduled time for today fails. When changed, it displays
   the
   latest scheduled time and date, but the report does not run
   then. It
   runs in the previously future scheduled day and time.
   
   Steps to replicate:
   1. Bring up a work order in work order tracking.
   2. Using Select Action, Run Reports, schedule the Details report
   to run
   two days from now at a selected time (say 9 am).
   3. Submit the report and close all reports dialogs.
   4. Once again, using Select Action Run Reports, display the
   Schedule
   Status of that scheduled report.
   5. Expand the line to show the details. Change the date to today
   but
   leave the same time (has to be later than current time).
   6. You can now exit the dialog screens and re-display by using
   Select
   Action, Run Reports and show Schedule Status. It shows the last
   changes
   made.
   7. Wait for report to run at the scheduled time. It does not run
   then,
   but will run in the future date/time that was set at first.
