APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Nokia user had Auto Sync turned off on the device and it was
   turned back on when upgrading to 852.  This is because there are
   a number of new settings under the scheduled catagory so the old
   setting was not preserved.  We will update to preserve a setting
   of AutoSync Off.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After upgrade, reset your sync settings on the device.  The new
   schedule sync settings are very nice.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If customer had turned off AutoSync on their Nokia client then
   upgraded to 852 AutoSync would get turned back on.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is a result of different sync settings for 852 vs 851.  The
   server was updated to not change this setting on an upgrade.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  This fix will be in 8521 and any future releases.  See this
   technote for additional maintenance information:
