APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue can be replicated when an email message (.msg) file is
   added to
   the P8 repositroy via XT with an event handler  entry template
   that
   removes the .msg from the document title.  It is assignd the
   application/x-filenet-filetype-msg mime type.
   
   -Since the document does not have the .msg extension in the
   file type
   and ICN sees the application/x-filenet-filetype-msg it does not
   know
   how to manage the message and assigns the ..dat extension
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  manually add .msg to doc title in ICN (not acceptable for
   client).
