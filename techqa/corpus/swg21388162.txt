Title: IBM DWA login page reverts to English language - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When the default language on a Lotus Foundations server is configured to something other than English, the DWA login page reverts back to English the next day.

CAUSE
Every morning at 1 a.m., the Domino Design task runs automatically and reverts the language setting. On traditional Domino servers, this task is used to update any database design changes. In Lotus Foundations Start, Domino Design is not a necessary task and can safely be disabled. In future versions of Lotus Foundations, Domino Design will be disabled by default.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


To resolve this issue in affected versions of Lotus Foundations, perform the following:



 1. Telnet into the Lotus Foundations Start server and log in as an an administrative.
    
 2. Run the following command to check that ServerTaskAt1 includes the Design task.
    
    grep -i tasksat1 /home/notes/Files/notesdata/notes.ini
    
    The following should be displayed:
    
    ServerTasksAt1=Catalog,Design
    
    
 3. Disable the Design task by running the following command:
    
    uni set cfg/domino/config/ServerTasksAt1 Catalog
    
    
 4. Verify that the change has been made by running the same command as in step 2.
    
    grep -i tasksat1 /home/notes/Files/notesdata/notes.ini
    
    The following should be displayed:
    
    ServerTasksAt1=Catalog
    
    
    The Design task will no longer run at 1 a.m., therefore, the selected language will no longer be reverted back to English each night.
    


Optional : If the login page is currently shown incorrectly in English, perform the following:  1. Go to Web Configuration and select English as the server's default language. 
 2. Re-select the desired language.


The DWA login page should now be displayed in the correct language.
