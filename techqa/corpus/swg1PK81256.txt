APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As part of setting up CICS IA V2.2, you run the CIUJCLCR sample
   job to define the TCPIPSERVICE CIUCPORT.  You specify the host
   name and port number in the CICS IA V2.2 IA Explorer instead
   of the values for the DB2 subsystems' DDF resulting in the
   client connection failure.
   .
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   .
   The CICS IA client connection view contains the following
   message text:
   .
   Connection failed: [ibm][db2][jcc][t4][2034][11148] Execution
   failed due to a distribution protocol error that caused
   deallocation of the conversation.
   A DRDA Data Stream Syntax Error was detected.  Reason: 0x3.
   .
   If you view the CICS IA error log from the Help -> About drop
   down there will be an exception entry as follows:
   .
   !ENTRY com.ibm.cics.ia.runtime 0 4 yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.ttt
   !MESSAGE Unable to execute SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT FROM
   xxxxxxx.CIU_RESOURCE WHERE TYPE = 'PROGRAM' ORDER BY OBJECT
   !STACK 0
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.DisconnectException:
   [ibm][db2][jcc][t4][2034][11148]
   Execution failed due to a distribution protocol error that
   caused deallocation of the conversation.
   .
   A DRDA Data Stream Syntax Error was detected.  Reason: 0x3.
   The CICS MSGUSR also contains message:
   .
   DFHWB0114 mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss applid   CWXN A non-HTTP request
             has been received by an HTTP service.  The request
             has been rejected.
             Host IP address: n.nn.nnn.nnn. Client IP address:
             n.nn.nnn.nnn. TCPIPSERVICE: tcpipservice
   .
   
   The CICS auxtrace contains entries:
   .
   nnnnn QR    SO 0D0C SOSO  EXIT  RECEIVE
   nnnnn QR    SO 0202 SOCK  EXIT  RECEIVE/OK
   nnnnn QR    WB 0501 WBSR  EXIT  RECEIVE/EXCEPTION
                  NON_HTTP_DATA,,,NO,
   .
   where nnnnn is the CICS task number.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Issue a FIND command for DB2 DDF message from the MVS console:
   .
   DSNL004I csect DDF START COMPLETE LOCATION locname LU
   netname.luname GENERICLU netname.gluname DOMAIN domain TCPPORT
   tcpport SECPORT secport RESPORT resport
   .
   Use the 'locname', 'netname.luname', 'domain', and 'tcpport'
   values to specify the connection preferences in the CICS IA
   Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS IA V2.2 users wishing to use the    *
   *                 new IA Explorer.                             *

   ****************************************************************
   The configuration exec was updated to remove the 'TCPIP Port'
   number required for IA V2.1 client.
   
   The following sample jobs were removed:
   
   CIUJCLCD
   CIUJCLCR
   CIUJCLC2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  All options and sample jobs associated with the IA V2.1 client
   have been removed.
