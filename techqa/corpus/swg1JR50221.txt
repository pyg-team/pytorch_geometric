APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Insufficient input validation in Apache Struts V1.x (up to and
   including version 1.3.10) might allow a remote attacker to
   manipulate class loader attributes.

   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ActionForm object in Apache Struts V1.x (up to and including
    version 1.3.10 allows remote attackers to manipulate the
   ClassLoader object and run arbitrary code by using that object's
    class parameter, which is passed to the getClass method. Two
   web applications in IBM BPM and WebSphere Lombardi Edition,
   Process Portal and Performance Database Warehouse, use Apache
   Struts, so they are vulnerable to this security exposure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V7.5.1.0, V7.5.1.1, V7.5.1.2,
   V8.0.1.2, and V8.5.0.1 and WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.5
   that adds an HTTP filter to each of the web applications. With
   this filter, the vulnerable class loader parameter is ignored.
