APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description :
   The DataPower tid is mapped to ITCAM SOA field ThreadID when
    DataPower data is collected by ITCAM SOA.  The ITCAM SOA agent
    code has defined the ThreadID field as a 32-bit integer, which
    can contain a maximum value of 2,147,483,647.
    When the ITCAM SOA agent tries to process tid values like
    2,796,862,897 that exceed the maximum ThreadID value, the
    agent code fails with a Java exceptiom and cannot start.
   
    The SOA agent should be able to handle the large tid values.
   
   Approver : GC, KD
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To workaround the problem in the short term, DataPower can be
    restarted with the shutdown - reload firmware selection on the
    System Control page.  When DataPower is reloaded, the tid
    unique identifier will be reset to its initial value, a four
    digit numeric, which can be handled by the ITCAM SOA agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Transaction ID data field interchange between DataPower
   device and ITCAM for SOA is not aligned, causing a Data
   Collector Java exception and failure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Transaction ID field on the ITCAM for SOA Data Collector for
   DataPower has been modified and will be offered as a limited
   availability patch (7.1.0-TIV-ITCAMSOA-LA0007)
