ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware 4.0.2.8
   
   When the same Frontside handler is attached to multiple WSDL
   Ports configured in the Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy), one of
   the endpoints may not display the list of endpoints. For
   example, if you attach a Frontside handler named
   'HttpsInternal' to two WSDL ports, then one of the endpoints
   may not display the list of endpoints. Please note that,
   although the endpoints may not be displayed, the endpoints are
   configured and should be fully functional.
   
   When this issue is encountered, the 'Endpoint Handler Summary'
   will show, for example, 6 configured for a WSDL however, if you
   click the '+' next to the WSDL in question, fewer Local
   Endpoint Handlers are shown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  View or update the local endpoint handlers through the
   'Endpoint Rewrite Policy' of the WS-Proxy from the Objects menu.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower users having multiple local end points assigned to a
   Web Service Proxy, may not see all the local end points listed
   in the WebGUI when accessing the Web Service Proxy via the
   Control Panel icon or Service menu option.
   
   The end poins are configured, but the UI is failing to display
   all the endpoints.
   
   Fix will be provided in a future major release. No formal fix is
   planned for the current release(s).
