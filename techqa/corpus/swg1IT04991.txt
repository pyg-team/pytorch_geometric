APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Following an upgrade of PureApplicaiton System firmware from
   version 1.1.0.4 to 2.0.0.0, there may be entries left in the
   
   System Console >  System > Problems
   
   panel that have links to events that no longer exist.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When the upgrade processing runs during the change from V1.0 to
   V2.0, all of the existing events are removed. However, that
   process did not consider existing problems that might be linked
   to those events. This leaves problem records that existed from
   before the upgrade with links  to events that have been removed.
   
   There are two options available:
   
   1. Delete all of the problems that were created prior to the
   upgrade to get a clean slate.
   
   2. Do nothing - these problems will have links to non-existing
   events and will not be correlated to new problems (there is a
   new correlation algorithm with the new release)
   
   Since those problem records that existed prior to the upgrade
   will not correlate to new call home events/problems, we
   recommend that you use option #1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Invalid event links exist on the Problems detail page after
   a system upgrade.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A timer job has been implemented in PureApplication System
   version 2.0.0.1 to check the problem records and remove the
   event link if it has been deleted.
