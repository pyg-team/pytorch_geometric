OPM CDPMA1114E SQL 723 Linux TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why installation of InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager (OPM) returns 'CDPMA1114E A repository server operation failed' and DB2 Error SQLCODE=-723? 

CAUSE
This is a known issue that can occur if during the OPM installation the database directory has the default path selected.
The install fails to run 'db2chglibpath' to set the path to the GSKit location
The problem only happens when installing OPM 5.3.1 GA on Linux platform, and has been fixed in 5.3.1 APAR 2 (8391 driver) or later.


ANSWER
There are two options: 


1. Workaround:
Run the following command as a root user from the correct sqllib\bin directory.
db2chglibpath --search=/DoNotCreate.*marker2_for_chglibpath --replace=<DB2_install_directory > <OPM_install_directory>

Example :
db2chglibpath --search=/DoNotCreate.*marker2_for_chglibpath --replace=/opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/lib64/gskit /opt/ibm/OPM/RepositoryServer/bin/fpesnap648_8363

After running this command, restart OPM.
