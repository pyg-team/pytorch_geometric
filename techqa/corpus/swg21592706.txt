QUESTION
 When a WebSphere® Message Broker flow has incorporated a WebSphere® Transformation Extender (WTX) Map Node with the "Cache Map" feature enabled and the map specified in the WTX Map Node is overridden in a Message Broker Compute Node with the MapServerLocation, will the map be cached?


ANSWER
Use of the MapServerLocation setting in a Compute Node will override the "Cache Map" feature and the map specified by MapServerLocation will not be cached.
