   .
   Search for 'Communication Link Error' in collector log file
   which
   restricts Collector service from restarting and hence collector
   can not collect data.
   .
   Example error in collector log:
   MSU0500I (041819) SQLSTATE: 08S01, Native error: 0, Message:
    [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Communication link failure
   QPP0204E (041819) DoSQL failed: 2
