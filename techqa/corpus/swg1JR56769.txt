APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Process Designer, the SQL Connector panel displays the
   following information:
   
   Standard JDBC Types: ARRAY, BIGINT, BINARY, BIT, BLOB, BOOLEAN,
   CHAR, CLOB, DATALINK, DATE, DECIMAL, DISTINCT, DOUBLE, FLOAT,
   INTEGER, AVA_OBJECT,         LONGVARBINARY....
   
   However, even though all these types are technically available,
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) does not transform complex
   IBM BPM types (such as TWObjects) to standard JDBC types that
   the database can process. Therefore, the SQL Connector code can
   handle only simple types.
   
   The limitation information is missing from the documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the Java integration feature to invoke custom Java code
   using JDBC java interfaces to call stored procedures.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Information about this limitation will be added to the
   SQLParameter variable types description in an upcoming IBM BPM
   V8.5.7 cumulative fix.
