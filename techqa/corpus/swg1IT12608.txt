APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Unable to export the SSH Host Identity Key from Sterling B2B
   Integrator (SBI), so that you import the key into SSP Sterling
   Secure Proxy servers.
   
   When you export an SSH Host Identity Key created within
   Sterling B2B Integrator (SBI), the passphrase is encrypted
   (unreadable). There is nomethod to decrypt this passphrase, so
   you cannot import the SSH Host Identity Key into Sterling Secure
   Proxy (SSP) server.
   
   A customer requests a valid method to export the SSH Host
   Identity Key, originally created within SBI, so that this key
   can be imported into their SSP server.
   This export or import method ensures that there is no
   impact to the remote customers. The remote trading
   partners can continue to use the existing public key,
   even though SSP is added into the environment configuration.
