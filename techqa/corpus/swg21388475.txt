PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Configuring IBM WebSphere Portal with no session timeout can cause memory growth problems because of the accumulation of HTTP sessions that live forever in the Java heap. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is better to configure a finite session timeout in order to control memory usage of session management.
For example, set the session timeout to 30 minutes (the default). After testing this value, you may increase or decrease it in order to better customize the user experience on Portal.
