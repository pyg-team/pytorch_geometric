QUESTION
 Why does the Security Network Protection (XGS) sensor still use the Default IPS policy for inspection when no Network Access Policy (NAP) rules are configured to use it? 

ANSWER
In order to match a NAP rule, the packet must match all of the items in the rule (Source, Destination, Application, and so on). If the XGS cannot match a packet to a rule due to it not having enough information yet, it analyzes that packet using the Default IPS policy. When the XGS receives enough packets to make a decision about matching the NAP rules, it compares the connection to the configured rules. If the connection matches a rule, the sensor uses the IPS policy that is defined for that rule. If the connection does not match any of the NAP rules, the sensor continues inspecting the traffic using the Default IPS policy. This behavior is by design and exists so that all traffic is inspected in some way.

Example: The XGS is configured with the following NAP rules: 

Order Source Destination Application Action Inspection 1 203.0.113.5 Any Any Do Not Inspect [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990362&amp;aid=1] 2 Any Any Social Networking Reject [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990362&amp;aid=1] 3 Any Any Any Accept ABC IPS policy When a TCP connection arrives, the first three packets are SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK in order to establish the TCP session. The first rule matches based on IP address only, so it can be matched against the initial TCP session packets. 

Rule 2 matches social networking traffic, such as Facebook, so it needs more information than is provided in the initial TCP packets. The sensor must allow more packets to arrive before it can determine whether this traffic is from a social networking connection. While it is allowing the additional packets to arrive, it is inspecting the connection with the Default IPS policy. When enough packets arrive to determine the application, the sensor inspects the connection against rule 2. 

If the connection does not match rule 2, the sensor compares it to rule 3. Rule 3 matches all traffic that is not caught by the first two rules. Any traffic that has gotten this far will no longer be inspected by the Default IPS policy. Instead, the traffic is inspected by the ABC IPS policy as defined in rule 3.
