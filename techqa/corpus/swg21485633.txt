Title: IBM Job fails with "parameter is undefined" when using Modeler stream parameter against C&DS job variable - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 With Modeler 14.1 I have made a stream which contains :
----------------
A source node
A selection node
A graphs node.
------------------
In the 'Stream properties' I defined with 'parameters' a parameter with a 'prompt'.
I left the 'value' blank and stored the stream into my C&DS4.2 repository.
I have added the stream into a job and added in the 'Job Variables' tab a new variable (e.g. : age).
In the 'parameters' tab of the jobstep I added ${JobVariable.age} in the 'value' column.
I saved the job and launched 'PEB'
I selected my job to run it and in the prompt 'age' I added a value.
I submit the job and see 'Failure' in the 'Status' column.
The log shows 'CLEM Error : The parameter '$P-Age' is undifined in expression : age = '$P-Age'.
REM1 : When I execute the stream in Modeler and fill in a value in the prompt (e.g.: 50) and re-store the stream I can run the job in PEB getting a empty prompt where I can fill an other value (e.g; : 20)
The job runs successfully but the graph is made using the value that has been entered in Modeler (aka 50) and not in the prompt.

REM 2 : This worked before with C&DS4.1 and Modeler 14.0. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and will be fixed in IBM SPSS Modeler 14.1.0 FP2.
No workaround availabl
