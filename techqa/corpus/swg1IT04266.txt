APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When exporting a node which contains only the last incremental
   backup including group data (like VM, systemstate, ...) with
   MERGEFILESPACES=YES option, some of the grouping information
   is lost.
   
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:
   Example for VM backups (full and incremental):
   
   - A full VM backup was done to the source server.
   - After the first export node of this full backup, a restored VM
     from the target server was able to start.
   - An incremental backup was done to the source server.
   - After the second export with mergefilespaces=yes including
     only this incremental backup,  VM restored from the target
     server will not start.
     A VM restored from the target server will not start."
   
     Error message: missing operating system
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager Server 6.2, 6.3 and 7.1 for all supported
   platforms
   
   Initial Impact:
   low
   
   Additional Keywords:

LOCAL FIX
 *  - Do not incrementally export a filespace containing VM data.
   - Export all the data in the filespace in one operation.
   - If there is a need to export additional VM data to a target
     server that already contains data for this filespace, delete
     the filespace on the target server first and re-export the
     entire filespace

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *

   * incremental backups for specific types of client data.       *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The EXPORT NODE and IMPORT NODE topics will be updated with
   following restrictions:
   
   "Incrementally exporting/importing the following types of client
   data to another Tivoli Storage Manager server is not supported:
   *  VMWare backups where full plus incremental backups need to be
   periodically, incrementally transferred to another server.
   *  Backups groups where full plus differential backups need to
   be periodically, incrementally transferred to another server.
   *  Windows System State data that is periodically, incrementally
   transferred to another server.
   
   Full export/import of this data to a new file system on the
   target is supported by exporting the entire filespace that
   contains the data. In other words, the export must not use the
   FILEDATA=ALLACTIVE, FROMDATE, TODATE, or MERGEFILESPACES
   options.
   
   The best practice for incrementally transferring this type of
   data between two servers is to use Node Replication."
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, and  Windows.
