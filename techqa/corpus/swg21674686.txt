PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Trading Manager, with acknowledgements turned on, a 999 with mixed data element separators is created when processing an inbound 834 file that uses ^ as a data element separator and * as a repetition separator.

UFO = Unidentified Foreign Object 

CAUSE
This is an defect. The internal 999 file created had to be readjusted to use a correct repetition, x12_library.mms need to be modified for both 997 and 999 repetition element creation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please contact IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender support to request a patch for APAR PI14997. The fix will be included in next release.
