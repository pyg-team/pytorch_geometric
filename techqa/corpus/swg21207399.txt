PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You would like to know what problems you might encounter when you upgrade from one release of CICS or CICSPlex SM to another. You also want to know what CICS problems you might encounter if you change to a new release of z/OS, DB2, or IMS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Select the appropriate link for the product you are installing to be taken to the corresponding table. Then, click the search link to the right of the release of the product you are installing. 



 * 
 * CICS TS for z/OS upgrading information
 * CICS TS for z/VSE upgrading information
 * DB2 upgrading information
 * IMS upgrading information
 * z/OS upgrading information
 * z13 or z14 upgrading information


If you are upgrading from an old release, you should click the search links for ALL the intervening releases. For example, if upgrading from CICS TS 4.2 to 5.2 then you should click the search links to the right of "CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.1" and "CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.2".
