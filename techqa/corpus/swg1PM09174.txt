APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For a Selector that has an include, if the include value is chan
   ged, it doesn t work correctly. In fact, it works WORSE than inc
   orrectly. The GUI shows that it has changed, but internally, it
   does not get updated. selection will actually bring in the 'OLD'
    selector criteria.
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce
   1. Create three selectors: a,b,c
   2. set a to include b
   3. Save a
   4. Run the attached API script
   5. change a to include c instead of b
   6. rerun the script
   
   Result:
   a still shows that it includes b and not c
   
   Workaround: Actually delete the include, then create a new inclu
   de.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When running the script the value of the include does not
   appear to change.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We do not use value for included selectors.  The script
   should be looking at the include uuid. The default value
   for a new include selector property has been changed to a
   blank to prevent future confusion.
