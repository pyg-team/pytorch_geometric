ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is uninstalling 6.5, then installing 8.0.2 then
   FP2SHF53.  After installation, a small portion of users cannot
   start Notes.  These clients work fine if the workspace folder is
   recreated.
   
   ISA logs are similar, both result in:
   
   The following is a complete list of bundles which are not
   resolved, see
   the prior log entry for the root cause if it exists:
   
   followed by a long list of bundles that are not resolved.
   
   The two similar trace log severe errors I see are:
   
   Application error
   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application
   service.
   Ensure that the org.eclipse.core.runtime bundle is resolved and
   started
   (see config.ini).
