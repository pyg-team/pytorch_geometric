APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is possible that a new LDAP user, or an LDAP user that was
   moved within the LDAP domain, may be authorized by the
   application server, but then not found by a CPE server in an
   LDAP search, which causes the user to be added to the CPE
   negative cache.  This may happen if there are a large number of
   LDAP servers, and the application server authorizes the user
   against an LDAP server that is updated before the LDAP server
   that CPE uses to search for the user.  In this case, the user is
   added to a negative cache on the CPE server, and cannot log in
   until the CPE JVM is restarted.
   
   The negative cache was added to CPE in 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002, and
   in the initial release of CPE 5.2.1.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the CPE instances.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users with mismatched JAAS versus P8 directory               *
   * configurations with 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 or                   *
   * 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 and prior.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Under certain conditions, usually the results of incorrect   *
   * JAAS or directory configuration a user who is apparently     *
   * able to log on successfully will not be able to access the   *
   * server and once this condition arises it persists until the  *
   * server is restarted.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.0.5-P8CPE-FP005 or 5.2.1.4-P8CPE-FP004 or     *
   * later.                                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is fixed in 5.2.0.5-P8CPE-FP005 and
   5.2.1.4-P8CPE-FP004 and higher by restricting the circumstances
   under which entries are added to the negative UAT cache, so that
   ordinarily users will not see this condition any longer, and by
   applying a TTL to entries that are added, so that should the
   situation still arise, it will be relieved by the expiry of the
   TTL and a server restart will therefore not be necessary.
