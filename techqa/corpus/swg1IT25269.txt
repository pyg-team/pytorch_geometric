APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user action associated with the MQ classes for JMS error
   message with identifier JMSWMQ2013 could be more detailed.
   Currently, the error message and user action is as follows:
   
   JMSWMQ2013: The security authentication was not valid that was
   supplied for QueueManager 'MY_QMGR' with connection mode
   'CLIENT' and host name 'localhost.
   
   Useraction: Please check if the supplied username and password
   are correct on the QueueManager you are connecting to.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ classes for JMS that are
   operating using normal mode or normal mode with restrictions.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The IBM MQ classes for JMS error message JMSWMQ2013 is thrown
   when there is an authentication error connecting to the queue
   manager and the IBM MQ reason code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED is
   returned.  Error message JMSWMQ2021 is thrown instead of
   JMSWMQ2013 if the application uses a client channel definition
   table to obtain connection details.
   
   The user action associated with the IBM MQ classes for JMS error
   messages JMSWMQ2013 and JMSWMQ2021 should have included more
   information on how to determine the cause of the authentication
   error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The user action associated with the IBM MQ classes for JMS error
   messages JMSWMQ2013 and JMSWMQ2021 have been updated to
   reference the 'Securing IBM MQ' section in IBM Knowledge Center
   and suggests reviewing the queue manager error logs for further
   information into why the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED reason code was
   returned.  The user action now reads:
   
   "Please check if the supplied username and password are correct
   on the queue manager to which you are connecting.  For further
   information, review the queue manager error logs and the
   'Securing IBM MQ' topic within IBM Knowledge Center."
