PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Updates to a WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender source map (.mms) file are not included when you build a broker archive (BAR) file in Message Broker Toolkit V8.0 and later. 

CAUSE
When a WTX map node specifies Use map in project, Message Broker Toolkit can add an existing map archive (MAR) file to the BAR file before the updated map finishes compiling.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



Do one of the following to ensure that Message Broker Toolkit includes the updated MAR file in the BAR file: 

 * Delete an existing MAR file from the project before you build a bar file. 
 * Build the BAR file twice, so that the "existing" MAR file is compiled during the first build.
