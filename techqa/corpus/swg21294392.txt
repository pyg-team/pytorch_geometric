QUESTION
 Is there a limit to the Xmx switch the eclipse.ini file used with IBM Rational Software Architect on Microsoft Windows? 

CAUSE
Setting the Xmx switch in the eclipse.ini file for SDP tools higher than ~1675MB causes SDP tools to fail to launch with JVM Terminated Exit Code=1 on Windows 

This is a Windows operating system kernel limitation due to a 2GB application process assignment.


ANSWER
Error Code=1 is reported because the application requested more memory than the operating system could allocate. 

 

Xmx has a practical limit of approximately 1.5GB
