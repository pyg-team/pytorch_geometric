PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBMÂ® Support quickly determine if: 

 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity. 
 * Locating root cause can speed development of a code fix.

Gathering general information Entering general information into an electronically-opened PMR (ESR) [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html] eliminates waiting on the phone to provide general information to Level 1 support. 

IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6 is made up of multiple components and it is possible you will need to collect information from more than one component and system to isolate and correct an issue. 

Gathering Component Specific Information 
For assistance in help identifying the component causing problems, visit the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Troubleshooting Guide [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/ic/landing_troubleshoot.htm?lang=en]. 

Otherwise, take a look at the components in the table below. If one of the product components below indicates where your symptom or the part of the product with which you are experiencing problems, follow the instructions in the associated Collecting Data document (some Collecting Data documents are under construction and will come available as they are completed):

Collector Tool There is a problem determination (PD) collector tool provided for ITM V6. This tool is part of the product at ITM 6.2 and above or can be downloaded from this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21284703]. The tool, pdcollect, is available for Linux, UNIX, Windows and z/OS and it provides the capability to collect the necessary logs and other PD information requested by IBM Support. 

Once the you have collected the PD information with pdcollect, this information should be uploaded to IBM using the steps provided in this URL Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html]. 

Submitting information to IBM Support  * After a PMR is open, you can submit diagnostic data [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/send.html] to IBM. 
 * If using ESR [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html], update the PMR to indicate that data has been sent.
