APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user has come across the following error when "Start Session"
   is clicked on a target he has access to:
   ***
   Unable to create a remote control session with the selected
   target.
   Unable to validate the selected target as a Remote Control
   endpoint.
   ***
   The user was at times ticking the "All" checkbox at
   the top when only a single target was returned. When he ticked
   the  checkbox directly beside the target entry, he was
   successfully able to start a session.
   Clicking the ALL checkbox is not really applicable for the
   start session option when you only have one target entry however
   L3 requested this apar to be open to handle this scenario
   in a better way.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected
   Controller : N/A
   Server : 5.1.2 GA, 8.2.0 GA Platforms: all
   Target : N/A
   CLI : N/A
   Gateway : N/A
   
   Problem Description
   
   When the results of a search for a targets are displayed, the
   user can click on a particular target and then select the action
   to start a remote control session. However, if only one target
   is returned from the search, it is also possible to select the
   All checkbox to select that single result and then the action
   "Start session" becomes available, but it fails because it is
   not able to associate the action to the selected target, since
   it was not explicitly selected, but through the All checkbox.
   This problem also occurs with other actions such as Target
   Status, when viewing the session details of a selected session
   using the All checkbox and when editing a user group homepage
   for a user group selected using the All checkbox.
   
   Problem Summary
   
   If a target report result only contains a single result, it is
   possible to select the All checkbox and have actions applicable
   to a single selected machine become active, however when
   performing the specific actions Target Status and Start Session,
   it fails because the target was selected through the All
   checkbox and was not explicitly selected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will be included in 5.1.2-TIV-TRC512-IF0011
