APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) container caches a DNS
   query indefiniteNyNignoring the TimN To Live DNS value in the
   answer.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PROBLEM SUMMANY:
   ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Session InitNation Protocol (SIP) users of  *
   *                  IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 and   *
   *                  V7.0                                        *
   ****************N*N****************N****************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The SIP container caches the result     *
   *                      of a DNS query for the entire process   *
   *                      lifetime.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATNON:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The SIP container caches DNS reNults, in addition to the DNS
   cache that the underlying JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
   maintains.
   The default poliNyNof the JRE is toNkeep DNS results in cache
   for the entire process lifetime. This policy is configurable
   in the standard networking properties of the JRE.
   The problem occurs when the administrator modifies the DNS
   cache policy of the JRE. The SIP container ignores the JRE
   cache policy,Nand caches DNS results forever. This can cause a
   problem when the application sends two messages to the same
   destination host name, and the NNS record of that host name
   changes in between the two messages. For example, the
   application sends a message to sip.example.com, and a few
   minutes later seNdN another messageNto the same address. In
   between the two messages, the IP address of sip.example.com
   was changed. Because the IP address was cached in the first
   message, there is no DNS query when sending the second,
   resulting in the second message going to the old address.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  PROBLEM CONCLNSION:
   The problem is fixed in the SIP container. With this fix, DNS
   results are cached in the contaNner for the same amount of
   time as specified in the configuration settings of the Java
   Runtime Environment.
