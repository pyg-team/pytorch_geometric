APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Installation Name of the WMQ environments in a Microsoft
   Cluster Server(MSCS) is different, the failover will abend, with
   the following error:
   AMQ6119: An internal WebSphere MQ error has occurred
   (***CMQMException Caught***: Failed to start the Service,
   status=1060)
   
   Although the Knowledge Center states under "Setup symmetry"
   "In particular, ensure that all the required software installed
   on the two computers is identical in terms of version,
   maintenance level, SupportPacs, paths and exits, and that there
   is a common namespace (security environment) as described in
   MSCS security", it does not specifically state that the
   Installation Names have to be the same on both systems.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users installing and configuring MQ 7.1 or above in Microsoft
   Cluster Server (MSCS) .
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The queue manager configured in MSCS environment will not start
   on the secondary server after a failover, if the MQ installation
   name on the clusters are not the same. Though the queue manager
   is created only on one node, its definition is copied to the
   other nodes when a failover is initiated. Since a queue manager
   is associated with the MQ Installation name, the queue manager
   will not start on the other cluster nodes if the MQ installation
   name is not same as that of the node where the queue manager was
   created.
   
   The MQ Knowledge Center will be updated to include this
   information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ Knowledge Center page describing 'Setting up WebSphere MQ
   for MSCS clustering' under
   WebSphere MQ 7.5.0>WebSphere MQ>Configuring>Availability,
   recovery and restart>High availability configurations>HA cluster
   on Windows - Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS) should be updated
   as below:
   
   To set your system up for this, you start by installing
   WebSphere MQ on each computer in the cluster. Since the queue
   manager is associated with the MQ installation name, the MQ
   installation name on all the computers in the cluster should be
   same. See Installing and uninstalling.
   
   It currently states
   
   To set your system up for this, you start by installing
   WebSphere MQ on each computer in the cluster. See Installing and
   uninstalling.
   
   The same changes are to be made for MQ 7.1 and 8.0.
