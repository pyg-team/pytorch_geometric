   review concerning their install. Depending on this info, you may
   or may not not wish to continue the install.

   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   As itmuser or any non-root user ID,
   On a Linux x86_64 system,
   Install the portal server from Tivoli Monitoring 6.22 FP2 media.
   Configure the portal server using the root ID.
   Run "secureMain -g group lock", where group is a common group
   whose
   members are all IDs used to configure, start and stop, Tivoli
   Monitoring
   components.
   Start the portal server and verify that you can connect to it.
   
   Upgrade the portal server from Tivoli Monitoring 6.22 FP6 media
   using the original install ID.  Start the portal server and
   verify that you can connect to it.
   
   Upgrade the portal server from Tivoli Monitoring 6.30 FP1 media
   using the original install ID.  NOTICE that the IBM HTTP server
   installation fails with messages like those shown above.  Start
   the portal server and verify that you can NOT connect to it.
   
   
   LOCAL FIX:
   None.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The reported problem is not reproducible with 6.30.02.00. In
   that fix pack, the design of how IIM is integrated with/used by
   ITM is very different. In 6.30.02.00, IIM becomes a local
   component under ITM. This approach seems to solve much of the
   class of problems as reported by IV46210.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Applu 6.30.02.00.
