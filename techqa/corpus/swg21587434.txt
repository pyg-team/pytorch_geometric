Title: IBM TEP Desktop client displays internal names - United States

Text:
TEP Desktop client displays disply internal names name application support JWS Java Web Start webstart TEPS level mismatch TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to get rid of internal names, which are displayed on the TEP desktop client, i.e. Kcp:KCP20092321554301018 instead of 'Application Bundle summary' ? 

CAUSE
The problem is caused by application support level mismatch.

ANSWER
Make sure the same level of the application support for the involved agent (e.g. here "kcp") is installed on the TEPS and on each of the systems where the TEP Desktop client is used. 


The TEP Desktop client requires the application support to be installed on the systems where the Desktop client is located. 

----------------- 

Also, and by the way : 

If the TEP Java Web Start (JWS) client displays internal names, then please review technote # 1407280 TEP showing bad labels for custom agent navigator items -> http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407280 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407280] 

In this case, the TEP JWS client only needs the application support from the TEPS and it downloads it from the TEPS each time. So you can try to just reconfigure the TEPS and see if that resolves! E.g. use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Services (itmcmd manage &), right click on the TEPS select "Reconfigure" and then just enter through the provided panels with already given values. 

Also, if you run with web client or Java WebStart, you should clear the Java cache on the workstations connecting to the TEPS. 

Clearing Java cache on the client system : Go to the system where the TEP client (i.e. the portal) is being launched and open the Windows control panel -> IBM Control Panel for Java. Under "Temporary Internet Files" on the General table, click on Delete Files... and make sure that all of the check boxes are cleared out. Then click OK
