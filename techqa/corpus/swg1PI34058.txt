PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5 using JAX-WS web services.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Can not get the correct client policy   *
   *                      attachments when there are multiple     *
   *                      version applications deployed.          *

   ****************************************************************
   Problems when getting the client policy attachments and
   there are multi version applications deployed. We will always
   get the client policy attachments from the base version of the
   application no matter whether there are multi versions of the
   application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed the code to consider the version control mechanism and
   get the current active application information when there are
   multi version applications deployed.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.12 and 9.0.0.4.  Please refer to the Recommended
