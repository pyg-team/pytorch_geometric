QUESTION
 How do you uninstall agents in IBM UrbanCode Deploy, so that they can be reinstalled using the same agent name? 

CAUSE
If you uninstall an agent from its host, you will not be able to reinstall the agent using the same name.

ANSWER
ANSWER 

To properly uninstall an agent, you must also delete it from the server as follows: 

 1. Stop the agent
    
    
 2. Delete the main directory for the agent. The default agent installation directory is:
    /opt/ibm-ucd/agent on Linux 
    C:\Program Files\agent on Microsoft Windows. 
 3. Do the following from the UrbanCode Deploy server GUI:
    
    
 4. Click on Resources > Agents
    
    
 5. Click the Delete action for the agent you previously uninstalled
    


You can use one of the following alternative procedures instead of the Steps 3-5, if you need to delete many agents:  * Use the command: deleteAgent [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.0/com.ibm.udeploy.api.doc/topics/udclient_deleteagent.html?lang=en], if you prefer to use the Command Line Interface
   OR 
 * Execute the request: Delete an agent [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.0/com.ibm.udeploy.api.doc/topics/rest_cli_agentcli_delete.html?lang=en], if you prefer to use the REST API
