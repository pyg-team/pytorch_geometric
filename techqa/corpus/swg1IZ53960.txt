APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:Find command for table views not consistant by
   attribute type
   Environment:
   ITM 6.2.1 with IF02 on z/VM and z/Linux
   Problem Description:
     Expand on the APAR abstract since abstract length is limited.
     Indicate expected results and actual observed results.
     Provide as much detail as needed rather than referencing the
    PMR.
     Explain what activity was taken that caused the observed
     action
     (ie: change in a variable, entry in log or trace files,
     pop-up, etc.)
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   For a simple way to reproduce the problem, see customer's
   screen-captures for FIND-NO-OK.doc at:
   https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/erdocs/pmr/2/2/22571%2C [https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/erdocs/pmr/2/2/22571%2C]

   This shows the problem for a Windows OS Agent "Process" default
   Workspace, which is probably easier to reproduce with than the
   OMEGAMON
   XE CICS Agent mentioned above.
   
   For another set of screen-captures showing it working fine, see
   FIND-OK.doc at:
   https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/erdocs/pmr/2/2/22571%2C [https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/erdocs/pmr/2/2/22571%2C]

   For the TEP Java WebStart Client trace log that I referenced
   later
   showing "ERROR (UNIT:Find ALL)" where I reproduced the failure
   on my
   test system (6.2.1 IF1):

   Steps to Recreate:
   
   1. Run TEP (any client).
   2. In the Physical Navigator, navigate to a Windows OS Agent;
   select the
   "Process" navigator item to show the default "Process"
   Workspace.
   3. There's a "Job Object Memory Allocation" View.  Change that
   from a
   Bar Chart to a Table View by dragging/dropping the Table icon
   from the
   top of the TEP.
   4. Right-click that View and choose "Find".
   5. By default it lists the first two Attributes.  Go to the
   third row
   and click the "Column" column (which is initially empty) and
   select
   another Attribute, like "Creating Process ID".
   6. Try to enter a Value.  It defaults to "Value of Expression"
   for the
   operator, and "==" for the comparison type.  Where you would
   normally
   enter a value, it instead shows a drop-down list with "Unknown",
   "Value
   Exceeds Minimum", and "Value Exceeds Maximum".  You cannot enter
   text
   here.  These correspond to the ENUM entries listed in the ODI
   file
   (docknt).
   
   So you are not able to enter a value there to try to "Find".
   The same
   problem happens with the other Attributes in that window.  The
   same will
   happen with other Workspaces / Views for other products, it's
   not
   limited to the Windows OS Agent (in the PMR, they first
   identified
   limited to the Windows OS Agent (in the PMR, they first
   identified
   this problem with an OMEGAMON XE CICS Agent).
   
   Analysis:
   
   When the customer tried this with 6.2 GA (they mentioned "6.2.1"
   in the
   Word doc mentioned above, but it actually showed 6.2 GA not
   6.2.1), they
   were able to enter a value in the field fine.  But it fails for
   6.2.1
   IF2.
   I reproduced this on ITM 6.2.1 IF1.  Sandy was working this PMR
   but is
   
   OOTO right now, so I added the tracing per her PMR notes above
   (ERROR
   (UNIT:Find ALL)" on the TEP Client).  I saw some entries but
   nothing
   that leads me to an explanation or to a known issue.
   I know there is a basic workaround; for example, I changed the
   "Value of
   expression" operator to "See if a value is within a range"
   operator,
   then entered a range that included the "Creating Process ID"
   value, and
   the Find worked fine.  But the "Find" function using "Value of
   expression" for the other Attributes should work fine; in fact,
   it did
   work fine in 6.2 GA, but no longer works in 6.2.1 IF1 (or IF2 as
   the
   customer had used).
   Question:
   What is different in ITM 6.2.1 IF1 / IF2 that could explain this
   altered
   behavior?  A known issue possibly?
   
   If it's not a known issue, then are there additional traces
   needed to
   help identify the problem?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Trying to set a filter or operator on the find command for
   enumerated columns in a portal client table display was not
   allowed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Removed the code that was not allowing enumerated columns to
   accept input for the find command.
