Title: IBM GSKit V7 and V8 installation directories on the UNIX and Windows platforms - United States

Text:
GSKit; Global Security Kit GSKit installation directories for UNIX Windows TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Quick Beginnings Guides state the following regarding the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) V7 and V8:

"Creating WebSphere MQ file systems

The installation directory for the WebSphere MQ product code is /usr/mqm. Working data is stored in /var/mqm. You cannot change these locations. The GSKit must also be installed into its default location."

However, the documentation does not state the default installation directory for the GSKit utility. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

+++ MQ 7.1, 7.5, and 8.0

Starting with MQ 7.1, the installation directory for the GSKit V8 code shipped with MQ is:
MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/gskit8*

Examples:

Windows: if MQ 7.1 is installed in Windows:
C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ_1
Then in 7.1.0.2 there are 2 directories:
gskit8
gskit8.8.0.14.12

UNIX: If MQ 7.5 is installed in Linux in:
/opt/mqm75
Then there is 1 directory:
gskit8
