Title: IBM Enabling SSL HTTP transport layer produces error SRVE0146E: Failed to Start Transport on host - United States

Text:
WTE 5.x; SSL; SRVE0146E; Failed to Start Transport on host; The most likely cause is that the port is already in use; Ensure that no other applications are using this port and restart the server; transport; transport layer; HTTP; 1259125 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Set a secure transport layer port in IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD) applicable to the Websphere Test Environment 5.x, for example, Server Overview Configuration ->Ports -> Server Settings, add the applicable host name and port and then enable SSL.

The server then fails to start giving the following output in the console view:


"SRVE0146E: Failed to Start Transport on host *, port 445. 

The most likely cause is that the port is already in use. Ensure that no other applications are using this port and restart the server. "


It does not matter what port number is applied or whether they have been checked for availability. 

CAUSE
The Websphere Test Environment is not resolving the connection setting when it is entered only from the server overview within RAD.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Implement these settings directly within the Server Administrative Console as follows: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Server->Application Servers -> Server1 -> Web container-> HTTP Transports
 * 
 * 
 *  446-> SSL enabled -> Apply -> Save
 * 
 * 
 *
