Title: IBM Output from AU.V (PROTECTALL) confusing - United States

QUESTION
 How do I interpret the output produced by the VERIFY functions within zSecure Admin? 

ANSWER
The VERIFY functions under the Audit category verifies the presence (or lack) of specific RACF environmental elements. They do not produce reports, but SYSPRINT will contain findings and CKRCMD may (or may not) house commands which can be used to resolve the particular finding. 

 *  If there are multiple ways to resolve a finding, no command is generated. 

 *  If there are verification observations of note, these are always written to SYSPRINT If the program can automatically determine how to remediate those, it will write associated commands to CKRCMD. Whether or not associated commands are automatically generated, a comment line is written to CKRCMD for each VERIFY function with observations. That includes categories for which no remediation commands are automatically generated at all. These comment lines do not count as an "empty CKRCMD". 


The end user always needs to examine the messages in SYSPRINT in more detail to be sure all concerns have been verified or remediated. 

There is a choice of running the generated commands first and re-running the function(s), then check for the remaining messages, or look in SYSPRINT before running any commands. 

Showing CKRCMD here even with no actual commands serves as a way to identify in which (sub)functions any messages exist, before zooming in to the SYSPRINT details.
