APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The timeout settings are working great on the Websphere/JazzSM
   screen for WebGUI.  But when you have a separate window for the
   Event Viewer and are actively using the product the windows with
    the MAP displayed will time out even though you are actively
   using the Event View
   Window.
   
   How do you set a timeout of 60 minutes where it does not kill
   the session when you are using the Event Viewer in a separate
   window.
   
   The 60 inactivity is a audit requirement, but activity in the
   event viewer window needs to be seen as activity.
   
   
   Solution:
   
   An APAR for WEBGUI is opened IV92436. That APAR requires a fix
   from DASH to resolve this issue.
   
   The APAR for DASH, to provide a fix that track all mouse &
   keyboard actions and reset the session timeout.
   excluding popups, and Iframe portlets, which aren't wrapped by
   by DASH UI.
