QUESTION
 Where do you find the version number of Tomcat supplied with IBM Security AppScan Enterprise (ASE)? 

ANSWER
 

 * If the Tomcat service is running, access root folder of Tomcat by accessing the following URL in a browser: 
   
   https://<server>:9443
   
   where <server> is the machine where AppScan Enterprise Server is installed. 
   The Tomcat version number is in the accessed page as follows: 
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684133&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684133&aid=1]


 

 

 * If the Tomcat service is not running, open a command prompt and run the following commands:
   
   cd <ASE_installation> 
   JazzTeamServer\server\tomcat\bin\version.bat
   
   where <ASE_installation> by default is: C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\AppScan Enterprise.
   The Tomcat version number is in the output which looks as follows: 
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684133&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684133&aid=2]
