APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Active Directory is used as the security provider, IBM SPSS
   Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS) 5.0 will allow you
   to log into Deployment Manager when leaving the password field
   as blank/empty.
   
   Entering an incorrect password will display the message:
   "Login failed
   Reason:
   Invalid user id or password."
   
   Once logged in (without entering a password), the end-user is
   able to execute tasks that their roles permit. This includes,
   but not limited to, creating, executing and deleting jobs. This
   is a serious breach of security for all customers using C&DS.
   
   This issue is currently on C&DS 5.0 GA and 5.0 Fix Pack 1.
   This behaviour is not expected and C&DS should restrict access
   to the repository to those who enter a valid username (id) and
   password.
   
   In the C&DS Deployment Manager 5.0 logs (spssemgr.log), entering
   an invalid password will display:
   [main] ERROR com.spss.mgmt.content.ui.views.RepositoryView  -
   Login failed
   com.spss.mgmt.common.core.model.ConnectionException: Invalid
   user id or password.
   
   But entering a blank/empty password, the logs will display:
   [Thread-9] WARN
   com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller  - Install
   operation start
   [Thread-9] WARN
