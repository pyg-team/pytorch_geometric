Steps to get support for WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/support/] COLLECTING DATA MANUALLY
The batch environment uses the WebSphere Application Server logging and tracing system. 
Gather the following traces if you encounter any problems in your Compute Grid(Java Batch) environment:

On the Scheduler server(s) enable following trace
com.ibm.ws.batch*=all:com.ibm.ws.grid*=all

On the Endpoint server(s) enable following trace
com.ibm.ws.batch*=all:com.ibm.ws.grid*=all:com.ibm.ws.ci.*=all
In addition to collecting the traces , please gather the following: 


 * Job logs - A job log is a file that contains a detailed record of the execution details of a job. System messages from the batch container and output from the job executables are collected. Job logs are located in WAS_PROFILE_ROOT/joblogs directory.
   If using external scheduler, collect the job logs of external scheduler as well. On z/OS this would be the JES job log of the JES job that launched the Compute Grid job by calling WSGRID. On other platforms there may be analogous external scheduler logs, even if it is not integrated into the Operating System. 

 * Run the collector tool against the Deployment Manager Profile to produce a JAR file containing your WebSphere Application Server configuration files and other logs that are useful to the WebSphere Application Server support team.

 * Gather all the JVM logs from the Scheduler and Endpoint servers, namely SystemOut.log, SystemErr.log, and the native stdout and stderr log files.
   WebSphere Application Server 9.0 JVM Logs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/ttrb_viewmsglogs.html]
   WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5 JVM Logs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/ttrb_viewmsglogs.html]
   WebSphere Application Server 8.0 JVM Logs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_viewmsglogs.html]
   WebSphere Application Server 7.0 JVM Logs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_viewmsglogs.html]

[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_viewmsglogs.html] 
 * Gather all the First Failure Data Capture (FFDC) files. The FFDC files are in the ffdc subdirectory at the same location as the JVM logs.

 * Follow instructions to send diagnostic information to IBM support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] to send the files mentioned in the preceding steps.

EXCHANGING DATA WITH IBM SUPPORT
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR)
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
