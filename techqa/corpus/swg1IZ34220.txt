PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The DD package is not updated on the endpoint when Oracle is
   updated on the endpoint.
   
   The DD package, which was added as a support package for Orcale
   6.2, is not correctly identified as a prerequisite for the
   Oracle bundle.  Like the JRE and GSKit products, specifying DD
   in the DSC file is insufficient for it to be downloaded as a
   prerequisite of the Agent during an update.  As a result, the
   Agent code is updated, but its corresponding DD prerequisite is
   not updated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to specify DD as a required download for
   Oracle whether or not the DD package is updated.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
