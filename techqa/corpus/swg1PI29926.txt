APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. Create a new library and a new project on syndicator
   server.
   2. Create a two-way 'All Items' syndication pair and wait for
   both syndication pairs are 'Idle'.
   3. Add the 'Sample Article' item from the library to the
   project on syndicator and syndicate
   4. Open the project in Edit mode on the Subscriber and change
   the project title with new title.
   5. Wait for the change to syndicate to the Syndicator
   6. Open the project in Read Mode on the Syndicator
   
   The project publish option on the Syndicator becomes 'Deferred
   to Syndication', whereas it is expected to be Manual.
   If the project item was approved then the project state would
   change to PENDING then SYNDICATING. However, the project's on
   both servers get stuck as SYNDICATING. Even if they did not
   get stuck at this state, the Publish Project button is likely
   to not be displayed in the UI as it is dependent upon the
   'Deferred to Syndication' flag set to false.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  1. Create a new library and a new project on syndicator
   server.
   2. Create a two-way 'All Items' syndication pair and wait for
   both syndication pairs are 'Idle'.
   3. Add the 'Sample Article' item from the library to the
   project on syndicator and syndicate
   4. Open the project in Edit mode on the Subscriber and change
   the project title with new title.
   5. Wait for the change to syndicate to the Syndicator
   6. Open the project in Read Mode on the Syndicator
   
   The project publish option on the Syndicator becomes 'Deferred
   to Syndication', whereas it is expected to be Manual.
   If the project item was approved then the project state would
   change to PENDING then SYNDICATING. However, the project's on
   both servers get stuck as SYNDICATING. Even if they did not
   get stuck at this state, the Publish Project button is likely
   to not be displayed in the UI as it is dependent upon the
   'Deferred to Syndication' flag set to false.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A solution is to make sure the publish option value is not set
   when hitting back from subscriber to the original syndicator
   server.
