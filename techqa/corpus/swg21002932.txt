QUESTION
 Object Access Method (OAM) has cleanup logic that can run every night. There is sample code that produces a report or an output file that provides details about the images deleted or removed. I know this data can be, and is, used to keep FAF tables synchronized with OAM. Where can I get the code to do this? 

ANSWER
To access a utility to delete the ImagePlus® Folder Application Facility (FAF) entries, refer to the following instructions, modules, and copybooks: 

DLTEXUTL SCRIPT

If you do not have them, contact IBM® through an electronic technical response (ETR) or a problem management record (PMR) and request that they be sent to you.
