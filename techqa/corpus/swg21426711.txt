PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve a CRJAZ0339I error, that can occur when trying to accept change set delivered from a stream using IBM Rational Team Concert. 

SYMPTOM
After upgrading to Rational Team Concert 2.0.0.2ifx1 from Rational Team Concert 2.0.x, you are unable to accept any change set delivered from any of the stream in the Jazz Team server repository.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426711&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426711&aid=1]


The following error is thrown to the jazz.log: 

 * 
 * com.ibm.team.repository.common.InternalRepositoryException: 
   CRJAZ0329I SQL statement execution failedVendor specific exception
   SQL: Insert Into {REPOSITORY.ITEM_TYPES} ({ITEM_UUID}, {ITEM_TYPE_DBID}) VALUES (?, ?)
   SQL Exception #1
   SQL Message: ORA-01653: unable to extend table JAZZDBUSER.REPOSITORY_ITEM_TYPES by 128 in tablespace JAZZDBUSER
   SQL State: 72000
   Error Code: 1653


CAUSE
This error is thrown by Oracle where the JAZZDBUSER table space is hosting on. The reason is because the JAZZDBUSER table space did not have a large enough area of free contiguous space in which can fit the tables being added by the upgrade.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, follow the steps below: 

 1. Roll back Rational Team Concert Jazz Team server to the version it is upgraded from using the Roll Back option provided by IBM Installation Manager. 
 2. Ask Oracle DBA to replace the existing JAZZDBUSER table space with a backup prior to the upgrade.
    Note: Ensure Jazz Team server is shut down during the table space roll back process. 
 3. Ask Oracle DBA to turn on the autoextend option for the JAZZDBUSER table space. 
 4. Proceed with the upgrade again following the appropriate upgrade instruction.
