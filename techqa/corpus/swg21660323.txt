Text:
rdz; PD Tools; 9.0.1; 12.1; CRIMA1069E; Updating IBM® Rational® Developer for System z® to 9.0.1.0 is not allowed; Updating IBM Rational Developer for System z to 9.0.1.0 is not allowed; the package is not compatible with IBM Data Studio client 4.1.0.0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An IBM Rational Developer for System z (RDz) 9.0.1 upgrade fails with CRIMA1069E or CRIMA1070E error stating that updating is not allowed. 

SYMPTOM
While attempting to upgrade RDz 9.0 to 9.0.1 in IBM Installation Manager, this error message occurs: 


CRIMA1069E: Updating IBM® Rational® Developer for System z® to 9.0.1.0 is not allowed; the package is not compatible with IBM Data Studio client 4.1.0.0 

OR

CRIMA1070E: Updating IBM® Rational® Developer for System z® to 9.0.1.0 is not allowed; it is not compatible with the other packages.


The Installation Manager log contains these messages (if CRIMA1070E is received, that message would appear at beginning of log):

CRIMA1069E: Updating IBM Rational Developer for System z to 9.0.1.0 is not allowed; the package is not compatible with IBM Data Studio client 4.1.0.0.

Packages that are not compatible cannot be installed in the same package group.

Check for compatible updates for the package. For information about updates for a package, see the package documentation.

CAUSE
Even though the CRIMA1069E error message implies there is an incompatibility, there is no incompatibility between RDz 9.0.1 and Data Studio 4.1.0. 

Both of these errors, CRIMA1069E and CRIMA1070E, occur when PD Tools plugins have been installed in the same package as RDz 9.0. This problem is currently being looked at by the RDz and PD Tools teams.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Rational Developer for System z 9.0 is installed in the same IBM Installation Manager package as IBM Problem Determination Tools for z/OS plugins 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you experience one of these errors (CRIMA1069E or CRIMA1070E) while upgrading RDz to the 9.0.1 fixpack, verify that you have IBM PD Tools plugins installed in the same package as RDz 9.0.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps in Installation Manager: 

 1. Uninstall IBM PD Tools plugins. 
 2. Upgrade the RDz 9.0 client to the 9.0.1 fixpack. 
 3. Re-install the PD Tools plugins keeping this information in mind:
