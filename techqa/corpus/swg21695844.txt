Title: IBM Default custom interface profile selection can't be cleared - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the new IBM Cognos 10.2.2 functionality to create custom User Interface Profiles, if users have access to multiple profiles they will be prompted to select a profile when opening Report Studio or Workspace Advanced. Once the interface profile is selected, if they check the checkbox to set their selection as the default selection they will not be able to open the other studio during that session. 

CAUSE
New functionality to set the default selection for the user interface profile to be used is committed for that session and can't be removed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to remove your default selection, you will need to logout of IBM Cognos Connection and clear the browser cookies and close the browser. As this functionality is session based and not committed to your IBM Cognos user profile, the only way to clear out the selection is to clear browser cookies.


Once this is complete simply open a new browser session and log in to IBM Cognos Connection and when you open Workspace Advanced or Report Studio you will again be prompted to select a user interface profile.
