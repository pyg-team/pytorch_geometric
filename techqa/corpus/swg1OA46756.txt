PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring 7.0.1 users.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The MQ agent cannot monitor any queue   *
   *                      managers when PRIMESPA/IGVDGNPP tool    *
   *                      is enabled. The following error appears *
   *                      in the RKLVLOG:                         *
   *                      KMQCI108E Invalid keyword DEFSAMPCYCLE  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply this PTF.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A TM instruction is incorrectly coded as OC which access
   unconsciously the byte at offset PSA+X'80'. When running
   with the IGVDGNPP tool, the data may now be primed with
   non-zero value. This makes the parsing of the SET QUEUE
   command to fail, which in turn causes all remaining
   commands in KMQSTART and KMQUSER ignored.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is modified to use the correct instruction.
