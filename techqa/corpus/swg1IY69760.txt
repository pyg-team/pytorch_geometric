APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer will experience large amounts of shared memory being
   created over the course of a long-running qmgr where a large
   number of syncpointed MQGET/MQPUT operations are performed by
   separate WMQ connections. I.e. if an application thread
   connects, does some work under syncpoint, and disconnects, then
   a small amount of memory is leaked.
   
   If the leak consumes all available machine memory or
   addressable process space, then WMQ will dump FDCs to indicate
   the inability to create any more shared memory segments.
   At this stage, FDCs with Probe ID: XY132036 and AT061002 with
   AMQ6207 error could be observed.
   
   The leak is a CSD08-introduced regression, present also in
   CSD09.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users performing large numbers of connections, where each
   connection does some syncpointed work.
   
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Failure to free a particular shared memory structure allocated
   as part of WMQ's internal transaction mechanism.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ensured that the shared memory structure is deallocated when a
   thread's transactional work is being wound up.
   
   The fix will be included in the following PTFs:
