Effective license usage of Eclipse-based IBM Rational products

ANSWER
Overview 

The v7.0 and later releases of the Rational products listed below use a common activation scheme. This technote outlines the activation product for the various products to help you get up and running as quickly as possible. 

You can now convert a trial (or evaluation) copy of the software to the production version of the same product without having to uninstall and reinstall the product. Additionally, if you own floating licenses of the products listed below you can now control usage of the products within your enterprise by using FLEXlm-based license keys as an optional feature (not available for Rational Data Architect and Method Composer).




"Activation Kit" or FLEXlm floating license keys required by these Rational products: 

 * Rational Application Developer (RAD) 
 * Rational Business Developer (RBD) 
 * Rational Data Architect (RDA) ** 
 * Rational Functional Tester (RFT) 
 * Rational Manual Tester (RMT) 
 * Rational Method Composer (as of v7.5.1) 
 * Rational Performance Tester (RPT) base product 
 * Rational Software Architect (RSA) 
 * Rational Systems Developer (RSD) 
 * Rational Software Modeler (RSM) 
 * Rational Tester for SOA Quality 
 * Rational Developer for System I 
 * Rational Developer for System Z


** Rational Data Architect support Activation Kits only. FLEXlm license keys are not offered with these products. 

Activate your product after purchase! The 7.0 and later versions of the products listed above will expire 30 days after installation. Rational Application Developer will expire 60 days after installation. You will need to activate your product in order to use it after the expiration date. 

Activation if you own Authorized User licenses 

If you purchased an Authorized User license of the products listed above, you simply need to obtain and install an "activation kit" for your product that will convert it to a non-expiring version. Activation kits are product specific (they are not host-specific like Rational license keys). This means if you own multiple licenses of one of the products, you only need one activation kit and you can use it on any machine where the product is installed. For example, if you purchased two copies of IBM Rational Software Architect, you only need to obtain one activation kit and you can install it on both machines running Rational Software Architect. 

If you ordered media for your 7.0 or later product, you will find the activation kit on a CD in your software shipment. If you do not have a CD, you can obtain your activation kit by downloading it from your license account on the IBM Rational License Key Center website [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/]. The kit will show up in your license account that offers the v7.0 product license. Each of the products listed above will have a unique activation kit with the naming convention of "Product Name Multi platform Multilingual Activation Kit", e.g. "IBM Rational Software Architect v7.0 Multi platform Multilingual Activation Kit". Once you obtain the activation kit, run the activation kit's install program after you install the Rational product. Installing the activation kit will allow the product to run without expiring. 

Activation if you own Floating licenses 

If you purchased Floating licenses of the products listed above, you have a choice: you can either obtain and install an "activation kit" for each product and install it over the top of your product installation or you can elect to use FLEXlm license keys to manage concurrent usage. (FLEXlm keys are not available for Rational Data Architect and Method Composer).

Activation kits

If you do not want to use FLEXlm license keys you simply you simply need to obtain and install an "activation kit" for your product that will convert it to a non-expiring version. Activation kits are product specific (they are not host-specific like Rational license keys). This means if you own multiple licenses of one of the products, you only need one activation kit and you can use it on any machine where the product is installed. For example, if you purchased two copies of IBM Rational Software Architect, you only need to obtain one activation kit and you can install it on both machines running Rational Software Architect. If you ordered media for your 7.0 product, you will find the activation kit on a CD in your software shipment. If you do not have a CD, you can obtain your activation kit by downloading it from your license account on the IBM Rational License Key Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/]website. The kit will show up in your license account that offers the v7.0 product license. Each of the products listed above will have a unique activation kit with the naming convention of "Activation Kit for product name", e.g. "Activation Kit for IBM Rational Software Architect". Once you obtain the activation kit, run the activation kit's install program after you install the Rational product. Installing the activation kit will allow the product to run without expiring. 

 * FLEXlm license keys
   
   During the installation of the products listed above, you will be given the option of using FLEXlm license keys to control product usage. If you do not choose to use FLEXlm keys, you will need to install an activation kit (see above). FLEXlm license keys are managed through the IBM Rational License Key Center, an on-line license key delivery service that makes it easy for you to generate your Rational license keys. Refer to technote 1250403 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250403] for instructions on how to log into the License Key Center if you need help. FLEXlm keys are not available for Rational Data Architect and Method Composer.
   
 * IMPORTANT FLEXlm LICENSE KEY NOTES 1. If you wish to use floating license keys for v7.0 or later of the products listed above (or for Rational Asset Manager), it is recommended to have a recent version of the Rational License Key Server installed. Versions older than Rational License Server v7.0.1 (for Windows platforms) and Rational License Server v7.0.0.1 (for UNIX or Linux platforms) will not support FLEXlm license keys for these products.
