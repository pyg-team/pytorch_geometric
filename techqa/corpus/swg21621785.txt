Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2INST; Tivoli Integrated Portal; install failure; COMPARE_TIPANDIMAGE_FAIL_MSG; abort TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2 fix packs fail with the following string found in the install log:

"TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP7.xml:912: ${COMPARE_TIPANDIMAGE_FAIL_MSG}" 

CAUSE
A 64-bit version of the fix pack is being applied to a 32-bit installation

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the install log (TIPFPInstall-*.log) in the install user's home directory for the following messages:

"TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP7.xml:912: ${COMPARE_TIPANDIMAGE_FAIL_MSG}"

and

2013-01-07 10:33:13.382-05:00 : INFO : [echo] mode=32 (from AntRuntime.execute)
2013-01-07 10:33:13.382-05:00 : STDOUT : fileName==========7.0.0-WS-WASEmbeded-WinX64-FP0000019.pak

2013-01-07 10:33:13.382-05:00 : STDOUT : 7.0.0-WS-WASEmbeded-WinX64-FP0000019.pak====32
2013-01-07 10:33:13.382-05:00 : INFO : [echo] WAS.bit=abort (from AntRuntime.execute)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download and install the version of the fix pack that matches the bitness of the installed TIP instance. One method to check the bitness of the install run the following command:

<TIP HOME>/java/jre/bin/java -version

If the "Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment" line in the output does not contain "b64", then it is a 32-bit install. Otherwise, it's a 64-bit install
