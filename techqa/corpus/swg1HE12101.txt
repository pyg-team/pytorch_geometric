APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a custodian enters a "&" character for one of the
   interview question multiline text fields, the "Save as Draft"
   function does not work properly. The values are not saved
   properly in the database. If the custodian closes the browser
   session and comes back to finish responding to the interview at
   a later time all the previous question responses will not
   appear.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Complete the interview in one session. Do not make use of the
   "Save as Draft" function and come back at a later time to
   complete the interview.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a custodian enters a long text value as a response to a
   multiple-line interview question, the Save as Draft function
   does not save the text.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.7.
