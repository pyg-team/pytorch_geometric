 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in Platform Application Center. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/97013 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/97013] for the current scoreCVSS Environmental Score*: UndefinedCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Platform Application Center v8.3, v9.1.x

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation such as disabling SSLv3 and remediation actions. 

If you have HTTPS enabled, complete the following steps. Otherwise, no action is required. 

For Platform Application Center v8.3, v9.1, v9.1.1, v9.1.2 where Tomcat is used:

· Edit $GUI_CONFDIR/service.xml, find sslProtocol="SSL" inside the "<Connector" XML element, change the value to "TLS" and then save the file. 
For example:


<Connector port="${CATALINA_HTTPS_START_PORT}" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
maxThreads="${CATALINA_MAX_THREADS}" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS" algorithm="ibmX509"
compression="on" compressionMinSize="2000"
compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,text/css,text/javascript,text/plain"
connectionTimeout="20000" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

· Restart Platform Application Center by issuing the following commands:
pmcadmin stop
pmcadmin start


For Platform Application Center v9.1.3 where Websphere Liberty is used:
· Edit $GUI_CONFDIR/service_https.xml and add the following line:
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLS" /> 
For example:

<server description="https configuration ##please do not edit this file##">
<featureManager> <feature>ssl-1.0</feature> </featureManager>
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLS"/>
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="{xor}MzorMjo2MQ==" location="$GUI_CONFDIR/security/key.jks" />

· Restart Platform Application Center by issuing the following commands:
pmcadmin stop
pmcadmin start
