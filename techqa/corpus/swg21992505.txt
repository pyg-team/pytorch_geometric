 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Content Navigator users are getting the error:
Unable to display document: Error: Inconsistent State, retrieveFromRegisty returned null.



CAUSE
The server hosting Content Navigator ran out of space on the mount point (or drive/disk) used by the application server used for the deployment of Content Navigator.

ANSWER
Review the application server and Daeja virtual viewer logs for errors that say: 'No space left on device'. 

Examples: 

SystemErr log:
[10/12/16 6:11:15:968 CDT] 000000fa SystemErr R java.io.IOException: No space left on device

SystemOut log:
[10/12/16 6:11:15:966 CDT] 000000fa SystemOut O 2016-10-12 06:11:15,965 ERROR [Timer-42] - System Manager: Unable to write to history file: No space left on device 

Daeja virtual server log:
WebContainer : 4 Oct 12, 2016 10:39:53 AM (267969247/267968652):ViewOnePlatform.navigator.clientlog> Couldn't create file for logging.
WebContainer : 4 Oct 12, 2016 10:39:53 AM (267969247/000000000):java.io.IOException: No space left on device.


In this particular scenario a network trace had been left running and consumed all the space on a mount point used by the the application server.

Investigate the cause of the lack of space and take measures to rectify or allocate more space.
