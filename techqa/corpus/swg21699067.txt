Title: IBM Process Federation Server (PFS) installation requires Java™ Development Kit (JDK) 7 (JDK 7.1 on Linux PowerPC LE) in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may experience issues later if the Java™ Development Kit (JDK) 7 package is deselected during the IBM Process Federated Server installation. 

SYMPTOM
 If you do not install JDK 7 with PFS, you may see the following issues: 

 * If there is no default Java™ set on your classpath, server creation will fail because it cannot find Java™. 
 * If there is a default Java™ on your classpath, but it is not JDK 7 or higher, then the Elastic Search feature will fail because it requires JDK 7 or higher.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To avoid these issues, rerun the IBM Process Federated Server installation and ensure that you select JDK 7 in Installation Manager by selecting IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 for Liberty.
