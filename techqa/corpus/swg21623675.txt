PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message IZE0106E Connect failed with error "Unexpected end of file from server" when trying to connect the 5.1 CICS Explorer to a z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) connection. You are able to successfully connect to this same z/OSMF using the 1.1.1.n version of the CICS Explorer. You did not make any changes to the z/OSMF environment. 

SYMPTOM
IZE0106E Connect failed with error "Unexpected end of file from server"


CAUSE
Incorrect setting of SSL or non-SSL for your z/OSMF and z/OS FTP connection definitions

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you define a connection to a z/OSMF connection, you must also tell it which z/OS FTP connection to use:

The above screen capture indicates that the z/OSMF connection is secure because "Secure connection (TLS/SSL)" is selected. It also specifies to use FTP connection "My FTP Connection" to access MVS and UNIXÂ® files. The connection named "My FTP Connection" has been set up as shown in the screen capture below:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623675&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623675&aid=2]

If your FTP connection does not use SSL, then you must unselect the checkbox for the FTP connection. You can have a secure z/OSMF and a non-secure z/OS FTP connection or a non-secure z/OSMF and a secure z/OS FTP connection, but the key part to this problem is that however this is setup on the Host side, it needs to be replicated here. If not, then you might experience the "Unexpected end of file from server" or a permission denied error message.
