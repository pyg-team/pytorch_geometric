APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an XmlAccess import is executed in the scope of a virtual
   portal, the <url-mapping-context> item that represents the
   context root is not handled as virtual portal context root, but
   handled as a URL mapping item.
   
   For example, a full export of the virtual portal
   "MyVirtualPortal" is imported to the same virtual portal, then
   exported again.
   
   The expected result is that the two xmlaccess exports are
   identical. Actually, the second export contains the context
   root of the virtual portal as additional URL mapping, like
   illustrated in the following snippet:
   
   <url-mapping-context action="update" domain="rel" label="vp1"
   ... >
   <portal-url resourceref="Z6_000000000000000000000000A0"
   update="set"/>
   <url-mapping-context action="update" domain="rel"
   label="vp1" ... >
   ...
   </url-mapping-context>
   </url-mapping-context>
   
   This leads to issues during import of such an virtual portal
   xml file, e.g. when importing into a new (and empty)
   virtual portal that has been created through ConfigEngine tasks.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually remove Remove the Virtual Portal Context root from the
   xmlaccess script before executing the xmlaccess import.
