Title: IBM TDWC Test connection Error when hostname contains underscore "_" - United States

Text:
webui engine connect TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation completes ok but when we define a new TWS engine, the connection fails AWSUI0766E. 

SYMPTOM
When testing you receive error :- 

AWSUI0766E Test connection to [tws_server] : failed.
AWSUI0833E The operation could not be completed. There has been a communication failure. The internal message is: AWSJCO005E WebSphere Application Server has given the following error: CORBA NO_PERMISSION 0x0 No; nested exception is: 
org.omg.CORBA.NO_PERMISSION: 
>> SERVER (id=486b2f9b, host=infra_svc2) TRACE START:

CAUSE
The configuration shows that the Hostname of the target server has an underscore, "_", in it. This is not supported in WebSphere Application Server. 

From the WAS Information Center: 
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rins_hostname.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rins_hostname.html]

Avoid using the underscore (_) character in machine names. Internet standards dictate that domain names conform to the host name requirements described in Internet Official Protocol Standards RFC 952 and RFC 1123. Domain names must contain only letters (upper or lower case) and digits. Domain names can also contain dash characters ( - ) as long as the dashes are not on the ends of the name. Underscore characters ( _ ) are not supported in the host name. If you have installed WebSphere Application Server on a machine with an underscore character in the machine name, access the machine with its IP address until you rename the machine.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install to a server with no underscore "_" in the hostname. Or change the hostname to include no underscore.
