ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer has an entire setup using AIX 4.3.3.  They decided
   to upgrade AIX to 5.1.  They have 1 Policy Server, 1 ldap 3.2.2
   and 2 webseals all on seperate boxes.
   
   After upgrading the AIX on all these boxes,both the WebSEAL gave
   this error:
   
   here the error messages
   dibtws002.ibtco.com # pd_start start
   Starting the: Access Manager WebSEAL Server
   ERROR: Could not start the server

   Looking this up
   
   0x132120ca (320938186) An unknown user was
   presented to Access Manager.
   Explanation: Access Manager could not locate the
   client?s username in the authentication registry.
   Action: Check the supplied username information and
   try again.
   Name: ivauthn_invalid_username
   Severity: Warning
   Component: ias / ivauthn_s_authsvc
   
   My first thoughts were a login issue to WebSEAL,but we were able
   to do ldapsearchs with the Webseal id for ldap in the
   webseald.conf file.
   
   We decided to unconfigure one of the WebSEAL boxes, but now it
   can not reconfigure, get the same type of error.
   
   I am thinking a LDAP issue but no major issues in the
   slapd.errors file except a problem replicating. They have a
   replica configured in LDAP but the replica has since been
   removed, but not set to unconfigure.
   
   Action Taken: I got the slapd.errors file

   It lookslike the master is set for a replica but I was told the
   replica
   was not running anymore.  Could this be an issue?

   I have two different system_status on these two WebSEAL systems.
    I have placed this data on pdlevel3 FTP site under directory

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   This issue was unreproducible in both the L2 an
   d L3 lab environments.  The customer was able to resolve this is
   sue by editing the webseald.conf file to state "ssl-enabled=no
   " instead of "ssl-enabled=yes" as no key file was enabled.
