IMPORTANT:
Before adding or removing hot-swap power supplies, read the detailed instructions below and references cited in your manual when appropriate. 




Working with Hot-Swap Power Supplies 

The storage server power system consists of two power supply CRUs. The power supply CRUs provide power to the internal components by converting incoming ac voltage to dc voltage. One power supply CRU can maintain electrical power to the unit if the other power supply is turned off or malfunctions. The power supply CRUs are interchangeable (by reversing the locking levers). 

Each power supply CRU has a built-in sensor that detects the following conditions: 

 * Over-voltage 
 * Over-current 
 * Overheated power supply 


If any of these conditions occurs, one or both power supplies will shut down. All power remains off until you cycle the power switches (turn the power switches off, wait at least 30 seconds, then turn the power switches on). For more information, see “Restoring power after an unexpected shutdown” and “Restoring power after an over-temperature shutdown” in your manual. 

The power supplies [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_1.gif] are customer replaceable units (CRUs) and do not require preventive maintenance. 

 * Always keep the power supplies in their proper places to maintain proper controller-unit cooling.
   
   
 * Use only the supported power supplies for your specific storage server. The power-supply controls on the rear of the storage server.
   
   

Levers[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_2.gif] 
Use these locking handles to remove or install a power supply. 

Power LED[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_3.gif] 
These green LEDs light when the storage server is turned on and receiving ac power. 

Fault LEDs[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_4.gif] 
These amber LEDs light if a power supply failure occurs or if the power supply is turned off. 

AC power switches[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_5.gif] 
Use these switches to turn the power supplies on and off. You must turn on both switches to take advantage of the redundant power supplies. 

AC power connectors[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_6.gif] 
This connection is for the ac power cord. 

Strain-relief clamp[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/revkey_7.gif] 
Use this clamp to provide strain relief on the power cord.

Removing a Hot-Swap Power Supply 

Statement 8 
[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/power_supply_caution_1.gif] 
CAUTION:
Never remove the cover on a power supply or any part that has the following label attached. 

[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/support/videos/power_supply_caution_2.gif] 
Hazardous voltage, current, and energy levels are present inside any component that has this label attached. There are no serviceable parts inside these components. If you suspect a problem with one of these parts, contact a service technician.

Installing a Hot-Swap Power Supply 

Note: When you replace a power supply that has failed, ensure that the power supply latch is mounted on the side of the power supply that faces the middle of the storage server. If it is not, remove the lever screw, flip the lever over, and tighten the screw on the opposite side. See illustration below:
