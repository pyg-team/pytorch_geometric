QUESTION
See below for Q&A describing the importance of installing the French server language pack prior to installing Domino 9.0.1 Feature Pack 8 (FP8). 

ANSWER

Q1. Does the order of install matter for the French server language pack (SLP) and Domino 9.0.1 FP8?
Yes. It is important to install the French SLP with the Replace Mode option prior to installing Domino 9.0.1 FP8. The recommended order of install is listed below: 

 * a. Install V9.0.1 Domino server.
 * 
 * b. Install V9.0.1 French SLP with Replace Mode option
 * 
 * c. Install V9.0.1 FP8. 
 * 


Q2. Why does the order of install matter for the French SLP? 
In short, the recommended order is required to get full feature functionality. 
In more detail, there are new XPages and LotusScript programmability features in 9.0.1 FP8 that are compiled into the file nlsxbe.dll (on Windows). Since this file is localized and is included with the Domino 9.0.1 French server language pack (delivered in 2013), the localized version does not contain the new features. 

Q3. So if I install 9.0.1 FP8 last, as recommended, will that result in localized strings in nlsxbe.dll reverting to English? 
Correct, currently this is a known issue/limitation (SPR # DJRCAGF4R7). Using the recommended order of install, the French file (nlsxbe.dll) will be replaced with the English file upon 9.0.1 FP8 install. Any localized strings from the French nlsxbe.dll will revert to English. 

Q4. What if I have already installed 9.0.1 FP8 followed by the French language pack? 
In this case, the nlsxbe.dll will remain the 901 French version, but may result in some FP8-related functionality/feature failures. To get full feature functionality, at this point you should reinstall 9.0.1 FP8.
