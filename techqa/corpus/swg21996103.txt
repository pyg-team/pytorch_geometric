Title: IBM Checking for valid URL's for DASH Web Widget - United States

Text:
DASHL2; Web Widget; URL; iFRAME; SAMEORGIN TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I check whether a URL will work in the DASH Web Widget outside of the Widget itself? 

CAUSE
Checking to see if the Web site can be viewed in the DASH Web Widget without having to test it in the Widget edit mode.

ANSWER
You can use Firebug in Firefox, Chrome Developer Tools in Chrome, or Developer Tools in IE11 to see what the desired web site returns 

 
For example, for www.google.com [www.google.com], In Firebox, start up firebug and navigate to the Net (Network) tab and then access www.google.com [www.google.com], in the Firefox browser. The Google web site sent back these responses as seen in Firebug.

It may also just return "GET www.google.com [www.google.com]"

The requests in light grey are mostly for images (PNG), CSS or script files, but the last one is for the Google home page itself. Looking at the response headers, you can see that it specifies X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN. This means it will not work in an IFRAME and will not work with the DASH Web widget.

Alternatively, using Firebug to access www.bing.com [www.bing.com], it does not have X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN in the response headers so it should work in the DASH web widget. 

We are not advocating using google or bing, just using them for an example of what will and won't work in the DASH Web Widget.
