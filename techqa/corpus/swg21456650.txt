QUESTION
 How to use IBM InfoSphere Guardium Installation Manager (GIM) 

ANSWER
IBM InfoSphere Guardium Installation Manager (GIM) simplifies the task of managing the IBM InfoSphere Guardium remote modules such as S-TAP, K-TAP and CAS. 

GIM is particularly useful when there are several STAP clients and manually installing or upgrading each and every one of them can be cumbersome and error prone. GIM provides the ability to upload the STAP clients centrally and distributing them to the STAP hosts.

GIM is comprised of two parts - GIM Server and GIM Client. The server component is installed as part of an IBM InfoSphere Guardium appliance or Central Management installation and performs such duties as registering GIM clients, providing a list of available updates that are ready for download and installed on client servers, transferring software updates to the client server, and updating the installation status of clients. 

The GIM client application must be installed manually for the first time on all the database server machines. It performs duties such as registering to the GIM server, initiate a request to check for software updates, installing the new software, updating module parameters, and uninstalling modules. 

GIM's UI can be accessed from the GUI of the appliance and provides the user the ability to install, uninstall, upgrade IBM InfoSphere Guardium bundles and modules as well as provide feedback about database servers, installed modules, and statuses. Equivalent CLI commands also exist.
