Title: IBM Missing  KMQMI171I Node <QMGR>:<SystemID>:MQESA is online Message - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I started my OMEGAMON XE for Messaging MQ agent and it starts but I am not seeing message: KMQMI171I Node <QMGR>:<SystemID>:MQESA is online in my RKLVLOG. Another symptom may be the Queue Manager (QMGR) are showing offline in the enhanced 3270UI (TOM) or greyed out in the TEPS Physical Navigation tree. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the following: 

1. The correct WebSphere MQ load libraries are being used in the OMEGAMON XE for MQ agent //STEPLIB. 

2. Verify the WebSphere MQ is up and running, the CHIN and MSTR address spaces. 

3. Verify the KMQUSER is specify in SET MANAGER NAME a name that is available in IEASSNxx member. Setting SET MANAGER NAME(*) will pick up all the Queue managers in IEASSNxx member. 

4. Verify there are no syntax errors in KMQUSER and KMQSTART in &rhilev.&rte.RKANCMDU. 

5. Verify the agent is connecting to the TEMS. 

6. Verify there are no other KMQ error messages. 

 

If all the above is resolved and you are still not getting the KMQMI171I message, provide the following and open a PMR: 

 * MQ agent log 
 * TEMS log it is connected to 
 * Active IEASSNxx member 
 * Screen print showing the *MSTR and *CHIN address spaces are up and running
