ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z 8.0.3.2 - RDz - User receives an
   'internal error' when deleting a file from LAN/Network drive
   folder.
   
   From RDz Remote Systems View, user right clicks on a file that
   is located in a LAN/Network drive folder and selects 'Delete'
   from the context menu.  User receives a pop-up: 'Multiple
   problems have occurred' indicating that 'An internal error
   occurred during: 'Process resource deletion...'.'  The following
   error is in the user's client error log:
   
   !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2012-09-10 15:19:41.788
   !MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: 'Process resource
   deletion...'.
   !STACK 0
   java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Illegal/unsupported
   escape sequence near index 11

       at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:54)
   
   Even though the user receives this 'internal error', the file
   that the user is deleting DOES get deleted in this case.
