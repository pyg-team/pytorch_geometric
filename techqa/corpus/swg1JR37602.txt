ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Current situation:
   The "Datetime Output Format" as well as the "Datetime Input
      Format" in the user settings are not influencing the way
      how a Date attribute is being displayed.
   
   Desired situation:
      Depending on the user settings of the "Datetime Output
      Format" the way how a Date attribute is being displayed
      should be adjusted.
   
   Steps how to reproduce:
      1. Create a catalog based on a simple item spec, containing
         a "Date" attribute.
      2. Make sure you have selected the new user interface for
         your tests.
      3. The default date format how a date attribute is being
         displayed is "M/d/yy h:mm a".
      4. Change the user settings for "Datetime Output Format"
         and "Datetime Input Format" to "User Select": "MM-dd-
         yyyy HH:mm:ss" or any other format from the drop-down
         list.
      5. Observation: The date attribute of your item still is
         being displayed in the default format "M/d/yy h:mm a" in
         the new user interface.
         This user setting only is influencing the old user
         interface.
      6. The same problem exists if you change the user settings
         for "Datetime Output Format" and "Datetime Input Format"
         to "User Specific" and the specify a user specific
         Datetime formate like "MM. dd. yyyy HH:mm".
