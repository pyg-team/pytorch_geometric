ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ************************************************************
   ************************************************************
   ITIM Server Release: 4.6-FP21
   
   Title: Unable to restore account without password write access
   
   Problem Description: Fix for S11795 is incomplete.  In the
   current code,
   we check if a user has write access on erpassword before
   granting access
   to a restore operation.  However, if the restore operation
   doesn't need
   a password on restore, and the customer doesn't want to provide
   write
   access to erpassword, they're still forced to grant access to
   erpassword
   for restore to work.  This should not be the case.
   
   Can the customer reproduce the problem? Yes, support too.
   
   Desired Behavior (BE specific): Users should not need write
   access to
   erpassword to restore accounts that do not require a password on
   restore, or accounts that can pull the password from
   ersynchpassword on
   the person record.
   
   Steps to Duplicate (if any): Create an ITIM group.  Create an
   ITIM user
   in that ITIM group.  Create another ITIM account.  Create an ACI
   that
   grants search/restore/suspend on ITIM Accounts to the ITIM
   group.
   Restart ITIM.  Suspend the second ITIM account.  Attempt to
   restore that
   account with the first ITIM account (the one in the ITIM group).
   A
   popup will appear stating that you do not have the rights to
   perform
   this operation.  A check of the logs with
   authorization=DEBUG_MAX will
   show that the request was denied due to lack of write access to
   erpassword.  The code in question is in AccountManagerBean.
