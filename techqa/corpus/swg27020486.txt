 2. In the right panel, click BPEContainer_scope, where scope is either nodeName_serverName or clusterName, depending on whether you configured Business Process Choreographer on a server or on a cluster. 
 3. In the right panel, under Detail Properties, select Security role to user/group mapping. 
 4. Ensure that the mapping for the J2EE BPEAPIUser role is set to All authenticated. 
 5. Repeat these steps for the TaskAPIUser role of the TaskContainer_name application. 
 6. Save your changes, and then restart the server or cluster on which you configured Business Process Choreographer.
