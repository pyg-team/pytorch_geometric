 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is Clearcase Multiversion File System (MVFS) compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bit? 

CAUSE
Microsoft is deprecating use of SHA-1 signing in favor of SHA-256. New drivers should be signed with a SHA-256 certificate. Unfortunately, WIndows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 GA are not compatible with SHA-256; updates should be installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64 bit so new drivers can be loaded.

ANSWER
Clearcase Multiversion File System is compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bits, so Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bit OS should have installed Microsoft updates to enable drivers built with SHA-256 to load.
