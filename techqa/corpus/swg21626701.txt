QUESTION
 How did IBM Security AppScan Source achieve support for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2? 

ANSWER
AppScan Source uses FIPS 2.0 provided by OpenSSL. In order to meet the secure distribution requirements of FIPS 140-2, instructions at http://openssl.com/fips/verify.html [http://openssl.com/fips/verify.html] were followed. 

The fipscanister build details are described here, by operating system:

Linux: 

 1. Ubuntu Version 10.04 was installed. 
 2. The gcc-4.1 package was installed using this command:
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.1
    (this matches 4.1.3 in the security procedure) 
 3. The existing gcc-4.4 package was removed. 
 4. A soft link was created between GCC/CC and gcc-4.1.


These commands were issued to complete the build: 
 * gunzip -c openssl-fips-2.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
 * 
 * cd openssl-fips-2.0
 * 
 * ./config no-asm
 * 
 * make
 * 
 * make install


Windows:  1. Windows 7 was installed. 
 2. Microsoft Update was used to install critical security patches as of September 6, 2012. 
 3. Microsoft Visual Studio was obtained from MSDN and installed. 
 4. When using Visual Studio for the first time, C++ settings were chosen. 
 5. Active State perl 5.14.2 was downloaded. 
 6. These commands were issued:
    ms\do_fips no-asm
    run outdll32/fips_test_suite 
 7. C:\usr\local\ssl\fips-2.0 was copied to a build machine.


These commands were issued to complete the build: 
 * perl Configure VC-WIN32 fips no-asm
 * 
 * ms\do_nasm
 * 
 * nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak


OS X: 

Note: On OS X, AppScan Source is FIPS Publication 140-2 "user affirmed". 

These commands were issued to complete the build (on OS X Version 10.7 with clang Version 4.0): 
 * gunzip -c openssl-fips-2.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
 * 
 * cd openssl-fips-2.0
 * 
 * CFLAGS=-m32 ./config no-asm
 * 
 * make
 * 
 * make install
