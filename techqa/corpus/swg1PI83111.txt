ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When we use monitor feature on Liberty, we can monitor the
   several  counters like "Used", "Free", "Created" and
   "Destroyed" of  connection pool by using Liberty admin
   center.
   If we set "agedTimeout" to "-1" for a connection pool, the
   existing free connection will be destroyed until the
   number of existing free connection is equal to minPoolSize.
   Then, the remaining connection would keep to stay in the
   free pool because of "agedTimeout=-1".
   
   Let's assume the following condition.
   * agedTimeout=-1
   * minPoolSize=5
   
   Under this condition, if only two connections are created
   and used, the "Used" and "Created" counter are increased
   to 2. And when the connections are returned to free pool,
   "Used" is still "2" although "Free" counter is increased
   to "2".
   So the "Used" value doesn't reflect the actual in-use
   connection.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Used Connections Monitor Graph does *
   *                      not display the correct value for Used  *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Used Connections Monitor Graph does not display the correct
   value for Used Connections.  The description on the panel was
   confusing and the value displayed for 'Used Connections' was
   incorrect.
   
   The wording on the panel was corrected for the Connections from
   'Used' to 'In Use' and the correct  value is displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The 'Used Connection' text was changed to read 'In Use', and the
   hover help now properly displays how it is calculated.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 17.0.0.3.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
