Extended Vob Support; 2gig; 1134066 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains what Extended VOB Support refers to when seen during the installation of IBM速 Rational速 ClearCase速 and provides an explanation of how you can benefit 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Extended VOB Support is synonymous with the schema 54 version of the ClearCase database. 

The Extended VOB Support feature upgrades the VOB database to 64-bit addressing. 

This allows the database to surpass the previous 2 GB limit on string files and the 16 million record limit. Refer to technote 1124619 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21124619] for more information about the 2 Gigabyte limitation of VOB database files. 

On Windows速 systems, schema 54 stores the native Windows SIDs (security Identifiers) for each user that owns an object in the VOB database. This new feature provides better support for trusted domains when a ClearCase community of users spans multiple domains.
