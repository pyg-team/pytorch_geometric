    Version Affected - TRC 5.1.2 GA until IF0008
    Component - Gateway
   
   Problem Description
   
   When running a gateway on Windows 2000, if you configure an
   endpoint connection with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255, the
   gateway fails to connect to the IP address that matches the
   endpoint connection with the following error in the log:
   
   tcpip: WSAStringToAddress('255.255.255.255'), error 10022
   Problem Summary
   
   This is due to a bug in the winsock library in Windows 2000,
   which prevents it from converting the IP address 255.255.255.255
   from a string to a binary number.
