ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   
   Description of Problem (full details)
   
   *** what is needed to be resolved ***
   This time, what we would like to know explicitly is just a
   compatibility information regarding to Windows Server 2003, w/
   or w/o R2 (for SP2) to IDM WS 4.0.1 (HFP 5 or later, of course).
   Please clarify this point. No fixpack of runnign test are
   needed.
   
   *** background of this problem ***
   Customer suffered non-effectivenes of IDM WS 4.0.1 related
   session timeout configuration after applying SP2 over the
   Windows Serer 2003 (not R2). In the compatibility matrix of IDM
   WS, it is not clearly stated that Windows Server 2003. It worked
   out before applicaiton of SP2.
   
   This verision of IDM WS 4.0.1 is described as supported by
   Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2. It is also confusing, that IDM DT
   4.0.1 is described as supported by Windows Server 2003 SP2 (w/o
   R2!). We need to clarify this, because this is just the boundary
   of what the support can do for the customer. (see the Revision
   Log of below and check the date 2007/5/12: it says, IDM DT & WS
   4.0.1 HFP5 had certified for Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2, but not
   written as "... 2003 SP2")
   ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/cm/filenet/docs/wsopend
   oc/40x/DT_WS_OC_CompatibilityMatrix.xls
   
   If Windows Server 2003 SP2 (w/o R2) is not a supported platform
   for IDM WS 4.0.1, we may recommend to downgrade the server to
   SP1. But if it is supported, we will have to check the session
   configuration and see if it cannot be effective as the customer
   stated in the PMR.
   
   
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since the compatibility document information has written in the
   excel sheet and shown onto the public.
   As for the Since after their update from SP2 for Windows Server
   2003
   
   
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   n/a (probably only one server that runs IDM WS 4.0.1)
   
   
   Is there a workaround? :
   As for the compatibility matrix documentation, no workaround.
   As for the problem they see, they said there exists some
   workaorund, but not yet dislosed to us
   
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Just to clarify the compatibility matrix, so that it can let us
   judge support customer or not (otherwise, this PMR is unsolved)
   For the problem itself, dIfferent behavior than previous state
   (before applying SP2), so the user session do not expires as
   specified time, difficult to manage user logon behavior that was
   possible before
   
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N -->
   Y
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..): anyone can see this uncertainty in
   the compatibility matrix on the Web
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1 Check the "4.0.1" tab of this excel sheet and check if the IDM
   WS is supported on the Windows Server 2003 SP2 (i.e. w/o R2)

   Actual Results:
   No description for Revision Log 2007/5/12, only written as "...
   2003 R2 SP2"
   One can also see IDM DT 4.0.1 is suppoted by Windows Server 2003
   SP2
   You may conclude, uncertainty exists in the description of
   Windows Server 2003 w/ or w/o R2 for SP2
   L2 cannot respond to the customer's query clearly.
   
   Expected Results:
   One shoudl have to clarify the compatibility information
   regarding to the Windows Server 2003 w/ or w/o R2 (for SP2).
   Because, w/ and w/o R2 is actually a different version of
   Windows Server 2003 (w/o R2 cannot upgrade to w/ R2 by applying
   any FPs).
   
   
   
   
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s
   
   What logs were collected and where are they located?
