     ................
   when WSAccessServiceService/createAccess of ISIM web services is
   invoked to provision a role access to self.
   The exception is caused by the lack of modify permission on
   person which is not granted to self by the default ACIs.
   However this operation can be completed through the SSUI
   (request role access) given the default ACIs.
   
   STEPS TO DUPLICATE
   1. Log into ISIM, create an organizational role and enable an
      access on it.
   2. Login to ISIM through WSSessionService using non-admin user
   3. Request a role access for the role created in step 1 using
      WSAccessService/createAccess web service.
   4. You will see that this operation fails with
      ?com.ibm.itim.apps.ApplicationException: CTGIMS009E You do
      not have the authority to perform this operation
      reported in the ISIM trace.
   
   DESIRED BEHAVIOR
   When WSAccessServiceService/createAccess of ISIM web services is
   invoked, non-admin user should be able to provision a role
   access to self without any exception (with default ACIs).
