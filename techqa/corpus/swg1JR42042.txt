ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem title
   
   IIS MDW Enhancement request for Case-Insensitive Search
   .
   Problem description
   During the POC testing we discovered that querying on standard
   properties and custom attributes, which are defined as a text
   fields
   (8000 char length) is case-sensitive, which makes it really
   difficult
   to find matches for the Business. The enhancement request is to
   use
   case-insensitive search for these fields similar to how this is
   implemented in BG Browser to be able to find matches regardless
   on how
   they are entered in the Glossary.
   
   Here is an example:
   
   Term Name: Scholastic
   Usage: The joy of SAVING AND Giving
   
   BG Browser Advanced Search on "Usage" standard property with
   keyword
   JOY or joy finds the term listed above, while the corresponding
   MDW
   query on "Usage" standard property with keyword JOY will not
   yield any
   result. However, if the user type it as it was entered i.e. joy,
   MDW
   will return the term listed above.
   
   Please let me know what additional information you require.

   version.xml
