Title: IBM Running Information Analyzer v11.5 Column Analysis on Aster database - United States

Text:
aster TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Information Server (all versions) do not officially support connectivity to the Aster database. But it is possible to use the Aster supplied ODBC driver with the DataDirect ODBC Manager to connect to the Aster database and then import table metadata into IMAM. 

SYMPTOM
When performing Column Analysis against the (unsupported) Aster database table, the Column Analysis job log will abort with the error message: 

SQLSTATE = HY000:Native Error Code = 34: Msg = [AsterData][nCluster] (34) ERROR:Unsupported Transaction Isolation level. 


CAUSE
The Aster database does not seems to support database isolation levels


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look in the Information Analyzer Column Analysis job log for the error message: 

 SQLSTATE = HY000:Native Error Code = 34: Msg = [AsterData][nCluster] (34) ERROR:Unsupported Transaction Isolation level. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the error so that Column Analysis can run against the Astor database table, please manually enter "Isolation Level = 0" when setting up the Column Analysis job. Do not use the ' - ' (minus) sign to lower the value to 0 as the lowest value allowed by that method is 1.

In order to pick the Isolation Level as 0, you need to manually type in the value 0.

Additionally, this value is not preserved between job runs. You will need to enter the Isolation Level value for each and every Column Analysis job run.
