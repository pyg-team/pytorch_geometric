Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere Guardium System x/Flex Systems appliances are affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0076, CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS: 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

REMEDIATION/FIXES: The recommended solution is to apply the fix as soon as possible. 



For version 8.2 and all versions of 9:
- Apply the iFix located here: 

http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Guardium&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=SqlGuard-8.2p1024,SqlGuard-9.0p1029&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Guardium&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=SqlGuard-8.2p1024,SqlGuard-9.0p1029&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc] After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160 

1) Replace your SSL Certificates. 

You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (ie using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 

2) Reset User Credentials 

Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.


Workaround(s) & Mitigations: 
None known
