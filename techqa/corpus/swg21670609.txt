Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The mdmadmin password specified at initial installation has changed in the LDAP user directory to conform to security standards.

The InfoSphere MDM engine will not start now because the configured password is not correct. How do I change the password for mdmadmin in the configuration for the MDM engine, without reinstalling? 

CAUSE
Because the mdmadmin password specified at initial installation has changed you will see an error message like below during the startup of the engine...
The Login failed because of an exception:
javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: CWWSS7062E: Failed to check
username [mdmadmin] and password in the UserRegsitry:
com.ibm.wsspi.wssecurity.core.SoapSecurityException:

ANSWER
To change the password for the admin user, you have to run the following 

command. 

Run "MDM_HOME/mds/scripts/madconfig.sh map_roles_to_users" You are asked to input the following parameters, 
"EBA prefix" is "com.ibm.mdm.hub.server.app". 
"WAS application name" is "MDM-web-services-<instance_id>". (This can be found is WAS admin console.) 
"BLA user" is the the admin user of MDM, such as "mdmadmin". 
"BLA password" is the password of MDM admin user. 

Note: The above steps work for an unmanaged environment to make the changes within a managed environment you will need to use the DMGR SOAP port within the script and not the application SOAP port.
