QUESTION
 What is the recommended way for getting started with the UX Framework and perceptive applications offered starting in TRIRIGA 3.5.x? 

ANSWER
Here is what the Support team recommends: 

 1. Start with the Compatibility Matrix [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/Archive%20of%20IBM%20TRIRIGA%20Support%20Matrices] for your TRIRIGA version. Go to the 'IBM TRIRIGA UX Framework and Perceptive Applications' section, and make sure that the browser you are intending to use to view TRIRIGA UX apps is supported.
    
 2. Know what licenses are associated with the TRIRIGA login you are using. Reason: If all you have are licenses that are related to Space Management, you won't want to try to look at a sample perceptive app for Requests.
    
 3. View some of the TRIRIGA out-of-box perceptive applications. 
    
    Here are the steps:  * Log in to TRIRIGA using a supported-with-UX browser that you identified in step #1 
     * Navigate to [HOME] => Tools => UX Designers => 'Model and View Designer' 
     * Identify a UX app that you would like to look at, based on the licenses you know that you have (step #2), and note the 'Exposed Name' value for that app 
     * To view the app you just identified (again assuming you have the right licenses in place), keep the <protocol>://<server>[:port][/context] portion of the URL you used to log into TRIRIGA in place. Replace everything after it with /p/web/<ExposedName>, where '<ExposedName>' is the 'Exposed Name' for the app you want to see. 
       
       Example: 
       Suppose, I used http://myserver.abc.com:1234/xyz to log in to TRIRIGA, had Request Manager as a part of my licenses, and wanted to look at the Group Move Request UX app. To do that, I would modify my URL to say http://myserver.abc.com:1234/xyz/p/web/groupMove. 
    
    
 4. Go through the different sections of the TRIRIGA UX Framework [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/UX%20Framework] wiki.
