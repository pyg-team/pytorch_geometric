LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  APAR JR52017 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52017] introduced a fix that removed some keyboard
   shortcut code from the Java snippet editor. As a result, in
   certain environments the Java snippet editor would not open. The
    fix did not initialize the remaining keyboard shortcut code in
   the editor.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM Integration Designer that initializes
    the keyboard shortcut code for the editor content assist and
   shortcut keys remain functional.
