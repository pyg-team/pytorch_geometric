ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  852 server with 852 resource template
   Setup and autoreminder in a resource database site document
   Set autoreminder to run on all rooms/resource and all
   reservations.  Run weekly.  I performed my testing on a
   Wednesday so I chose to
   send the autoreminder on Wednesdays.
   Create a few test reservations.  I simply created a 15 day
   repeating meeting, which excluded weekends so this was a total
   of 12 reservations
   Now, Open the designer client and go to Code -> Agents.  Open
   Agents in the main view
   Enable the autoreminder agent and then right click on the agent
   and select test.  Same results will happen if you hit run.
   You'll get a dialog box with verbiage
   "Running on all documents in the database:"  - in my testing
   the total count was 21 documents
   "Found 21 documents matching the search criteria"
   Problem:  The message above is misleading as the total document
   count always matches the count of documents that match the
   search criteria, and that shouldn't be the case.
   In my testing, only 7 reservations actually matched the search
   criteria, so the message should have read "Found 7 documents
   matching the search criteria"
   In my customer's case, over 2000 documents were found, the same
   count was found for matching the search criteria which is
   giving the customer great alarm.
   Side Issue:  The total count should only include reservations.
   Currently, this count includes all documents in the database
   including, room/resource docs, site docs, blocker docs, etc...
   The document count in general is misleading as well since
   customers assume the autoreminder agent is only relevant to
   reservations
