ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  **********************************************
   **********************************************
   Title: When filtering with Suspend, Restore or Delete User in
   View All Requests, these requests will not be listed. (LP issue)
   This affects customers using the Japanese Language Pack only.
   Problem Description:
   User installed Japanese language, then tried to list "Suspend
   User", "Restore User" and "Delete User" requests.
   They are correctly listed in View All Requests if he set
   "Request Type" to "All", however if he set "Request Type" to
   "Suspend User", "Restore User" or "Delete User", they aren't
   listed.
   
   Can Customer Recreate: Yes, and Japan L2 duplicated.
   
   ITIM Server Version - 5.0.0.8 with IF38
   
   Desired Behavior:
   Even if filter is used in View All Requests, appropreate
   requests should be listed as the same as no filter being used.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   1) Install Japanese LP, and logon ITIM admin console in
      Japanese.
   2) Create a user
   3) Suspend the user
   4) Restore the user
   5) Delete the user
   6) List these operation through View All Requests using no
      filter (All).
      It works as expected.
   7) Set "Suspend User" to "Request Type" in View All Requests,
      then run the search, but the request isn't displayed.
   8) Set "Restore User" or "Delete User" to the filter, but they
      aren't displayed as the same as "Suspend User".
   9) Change the language to English, then do the same thing.
      With English, it works as expected.
