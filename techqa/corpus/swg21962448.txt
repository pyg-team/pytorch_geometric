ANSWER
Netezza Platform Software Release 7.2.0.5-P1 is now available on IBM Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Information%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/Netezza+NPS+Software+and+Clients&release=NPS_7.2.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=7.2.0.5-P1-IM-Netezza-NPS-fp100771&includeSupersedes=0] for upgrades to the 7.2.0.5-level release stream. NPS 7.2.0.5-P1 includes an update for the nzhw command to support environments where users cache their admin user password (or other account passwords) by using the nzpassword command. If you are upgrading to Release 7.2.0.5, it is recommended that you upgrade to the 7.2.0.5-P1 software bundle and clients. 

If your IBM PureData System for Analytics appliance is currently using NPS Release 7.2.0.5, contact IBM Support for assistance with replacing the nzhw executable on the host. 

For users who have installed the NPS 7.2.0.5 client kits, they can continue to use the 7.2.0.5 commands, but users who run the nzhw command with a cached password could encounter authentication errors when connecting to the NPS host. Those administrative users can install a 7.2.0.5-P1 client kit available on IBM Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Information+Management&product=ibm/Information+Management/Netezza+NPS+Software+and+Clients&release=NPS_7.2.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=7.2.0.5-P1-IM-Netezza-NPS-fp100771] to use the updated nzhw command that supports the cached passwords.
