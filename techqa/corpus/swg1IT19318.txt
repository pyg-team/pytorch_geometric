ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users applying MQ fix pack 8.0.0.6, which contains APAR IV90867 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV90867]:
   Deprecation of 3DES CipherSpecs, remain able to use these
   deprecated CipherSpecs for inbound TLS connections by default if
   the queue manager is configured with SSLFIPS(YES).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of MQ 8.0.0.6, who have a queue manager
   configured to run in FIPS-compliant mode [SSLFIPS(YES)], and
   wish for the following CipherSpecs to be disabled for inbound
   TLS connections by default:
   
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   ECDHE_ECDSA_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA256
   ECDHE_RSA_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA256
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   An omission in the logic of the CipherSpec deprecation added in
   MQ 8.0.0.6 IV90867 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV90867] caused the deprecation of the CipherSpecs
   listed above to be ignored for inbound TLS connections when FIPS
   mode was enabled for the queue manager.
   
   If FIPS mode was not enabled, the CipherSpecs were disabled for
   inbound TLS connections by default as expected.
   
   The queue manager correctly rejected these CipherSpecs for
   outbound TLS connections by default, regardless of the SSLFIPS
   setting.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The queue manager inbound channel logic has been corrected to
   reject inbound TLS connections using these deprecated
   CipherSpecs by default.
   
   
   Deprecated CipherSpecs may be re-enabled using the steps
   documented in the MQ Knowledge Center:
   
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm
   .mq.sec.doc/q120565_.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q120565_.htm]
