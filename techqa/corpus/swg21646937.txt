Title: IBM Users become 'Inactive' and error "This file is not in a recognizable format" when running report after having changed Controller password (without logging off immediately afterwards) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the user changes their Controller password and then (without exiting Controller and re-launching Controller) tries to run an Excel-based report, they receive an error. 

SYMPTOM
Imagine a scenario where: 

 * 'bad' user is called 'BADUSER' 
 * Controller administrator (e.g. 'ADM') logs onto Controller, and clicks "Maintain - Rights - Users" and clicks on 'BADUSER' 
 * Administrator sees that the user is set to "Inactive" (this is what happens the user after 3 attempts to run the report - see later) and closes the menu 
 * Administrator changes BADUSER to "Active" and resets the user's password


Next:  * The 'bad' user now logs on as BADUSER with this new password 
 * During the logon process, user is prompted to change the password. Therefore he/she changes it (i.e. directly after logging into Controller) to a new password 
 * BADUSER clicks "Reports - Run" and chooses/runs a user-defined report 
 * However, when they click "Preview" or "Send to Application" an error appears:


This file is not in a recognizable format 
 * If the user clicks OK, they can re-try running the report 
 * If the user tries running the report 3 times, then the user gets set to 'inactive' again.  * Therefore the administrator must now change BADUSER back to "Active" (and create a new password) to allow the bad user back into the system.
   
   


CAUSE
There are many potential causes for this error. 

For more examples, see separate IBM Technote #1647017. 
This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is a code production problem (defect reference PM57170) in Controller. 
ENVIRONMENT
Controller versions before 10.2.1 FP1 (10.2.5110.85).



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Upgrade to Controller 10.2.1 Fix Pack 1 (10.2.5110.85) or later.

Workaround:
Ensure that all users (after they change their password) immediately close Controller. 

 * In other words, if you log out and back in (after changing the password) then the reports work OK.
