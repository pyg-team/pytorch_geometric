APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While creating P8 connection in ICC, the path is always taken
   as wsi/FNCEWS40MTOM, even if configuration uses a different
   path such as wsiedm/FNCEWS40MTOM.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually modify IBM\Content Search Services\CSS
   Server\config\afu_config_Email.cache to use the custom path.
   The cache file is in the same directory as constructor.xml.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While creating P8 connection in ICC, the path is always taken
   as wsi/FNCEWS40MTOM, even if configuration uses a different
   path such as wsiedm/FNCEWS40MTOM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 FP5 release, this
   issue has been fixed. While creating P8 connection, ICC will now
    use the custom path set on the configuration UI.
