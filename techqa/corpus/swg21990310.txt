Title: IBM Content Collector is not ingesting one Sharepoint document. - United States

Text:
icc; sharepoint; collection TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have an IBM Content Collector (ICC) task route that is not ingesting an item marked

for collection. I can see in the log that it sees the file but why it never gets picked up and archived ? 

SYMPTOM
All the other documents are ingesting file but not this document.


CAUSE
Having some special custom properties set on the document itself could cause this issue.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector 4.0.1

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Enable Trace2 level of logging and you notice the following messages in ICC for Sharepoint connector logs.
-----------------------------------
2016-08-24T14:05:49Z Trace2 0x18dc Column
"ICCSPMigratedInformation" not found on collected metadata for item
---
---
2016-08-23T13:13:08Z Trace 0xf68 No eligible items to
collect. 0 items returned from query.
-----------------------------


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix the problem with document itself by removing custom file properties which should resolve the issue.
