Title: IBM Primary ITNM fails over when healthy - United States

Text:
tally; failover; virtualdomain; g_event TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Healthy intermediate updates are sent to the objectserver each minute, yet the primary domain in a virtualdomain still fails over to the backup. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review g_event trace information in primary and backup.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Take care that the Tally field is not interfered with or altered in the objectserver. Each minute ITNM sends a health check update to the objectserver. LastOccurence is updated as Tally should be also. (Even though this is a healthy non failing event).


If the Severity is unchanged (this is the case for a healthy/healthcheck) then Tally will be ignored if not incremented. The g_event process will not forward this to the plug-in for processing. 

By default Tally would be incremented in the objectserver. Do not allow a trigger or automation to stop that from happening on a healthcheck event from ITNM
