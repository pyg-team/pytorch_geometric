APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The variance of two integer type measures, such as headcount,
   appears to be a decimal value with a scale of 2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue is related to the display format of Variance calculati
   ons generated by Adaptive Analytics. Calculations are accurate a
   nd do not affect the data consistency in reports.  Users can use
    variance calculations in any analytic type, and Adaptive Analyt
   ics also automatically generates these calculations for Variance
    and Period on Period analytic type reports.  In order to workar
   ound the issue, there are 2 different solutions:  1) For manuall
   y created variance calculations in Adaptive Analytics, similar v
   ariance calculations could be created instead in the Target Mode
   l as (Measure A - Measure B) for which the format can be set as
   desired. These Target Model variance calculations can then be ma
   pped in the Adaptive Analytics projects, like any other measure.
     2) For automatically created variance calculations (Variance a
   nd Period on Period), they are required by Adaptive Analytics an
   d can't be substituted.  These reports can be deployed to Cognos
    Connections via Generate deployment archive, and they can be ed
   ited using Report Studio and the display format modified as desi
   red. Note that these changes will be overwritten if they are red
   eployed.
