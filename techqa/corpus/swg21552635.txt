PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 OutofMemory and processing hangs. A large number of mailbox threads contained within thread dumps. 

SYMPTOM


 

Symptoms: 1. High Memory usage by JVM and Garbage Collection not giving memory back 2. Many Mailbox threads revolving around mailbox add/deletes. See attached thread dump. 3. Processing appear to be hanging 4. Eventual JVM OOM Signatures: thread Dump with many threads that pass through a class: at com/sterlingcommerce/woodstock/mailbox/impl/repositoryImpl/RepositoryDB.updateMa ilboxLastModification(RepositoryDB.java:2077(Compiled Code)) Also the heap dump shows the memory growing and not reducing for: com/sterlingcommerce/woodstock/mailbox/impl/repositoryImpl/RepositoryDB$5</ div>  

Error Message  Potential 'OutofMemory' error, OOM


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


 Within mailbox.properties.in change:

updateMailboxLastModification=false (By default this is true. Changing this to false is a temporary workaround. A more permanent fix is being researched with case#307120.) run setupfiles and restart GIS
