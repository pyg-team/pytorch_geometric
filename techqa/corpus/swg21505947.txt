PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Property data in console for inactive properties 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have activated an analysis the property results for that analysis will continue to show in the TEM Console's Retrieved Property tab for computers even after the analysis is deactivated. The property results will not update further as the property is no longer being evaluated on the TEM Clients.

To avoid seeing these results you can set the following registry key on your TEM Console computer: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\BigFix\Enterprise Console\Settings] DWord: ShowAllPropertiesInComputerDocument Value: 0 Note: Only properties not restricted to analysis only will be displayed in the computers document, this will include results from active and deactivated analyses.

Alternatively, if you remove a Fixlet site and then add the Fixlet site back the property results from the deactivated analyses will be cleared out as well.
