APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  statement was that
   snmpget() function is supported by the mttrapd probe but not by
   the
   Omnibus library, and syntax probe can only access rules
   functions
   provided by Omnibus library.
   
   We need a new doc apar to define this to set the correct
   expectation on current functionality in nco_p_syntax for snmpget
   functions when used in a rules being parsed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  hash out the snnmpget function in the rules file your using ,
   before running with nco_p_syntax
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the Probe Rules Syntax Checker.                 *
   * All users of the SNMP Probe.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The user can only use the Probe Rules Syntax Checker to      *
   * check functions against the OMNIbus Library and not probe    *
   * specific functions. This is not stated clearly in the Probe  *
   * Rules Syntax Checker usage description.                      *
   *                                                              *
   * The SNMP Probe supports the snmpget() function and this rule *
   * throws errors when it is in rules files checked by the Probe *
   * Rules Syntax Checker because it is not a function supported  *
   * by the OMNIbus library.                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The next version of the Probe Rules Syntax Checker guide     *
   * [SC27-2301-03] will have the correct information about       *
   * OMNIbus library support.                                     *
   *                                                              *
   * The next version of the SNMP Probe guide [SC11-7728-04] will *
   * contain an additional title in the Known issues section      *
   * explaining the issue.                                        *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The next version of the Probe Rules Syntax Checker guide
   [SC27-2301-03] will contain the following note in the Using the
   Probe Rules Syntax Checker section.
   
   Note: The Probe Rules Syntax Checker can only check functions
   against the OMNIbus library and not probe specific functions.
   For example, if you run the Probe Rules Syntax Checker against
   the rules file of the SNMP Probe (nco_p_mttrapd.rules), it
   displays errors relating to any snmpget functions included in
   the rules file.  This is because the snmpget function is
   supported by the probe, but not by the OMNIbus library against
   which the Probe Rules Syntax Checker checks. Such errors can be
   safely ignored.
   
   
   The next version of the SNMP Probe guide [SC11-7728-04] will
   contain the following title in the Known issues section.
   
   snmpget() function error messages from the Probe Rules Syntax
   Checker
   The Probe Rules Syntax Checker can only access rules functions
   provided by the OMNIbus library. The snmpget() function is
   supported by the SNMP probe but not by the OMNIbus library. This
   causes the Probe Rules Syntax Checker to throw errors when
   checking the syntax of rules file that contain the snmpget()
   function and other function not in the OMNIbus library.
   To prevent these errors occurring hash out the snmpget()
   function in the rules file you are using before running the
   Probe Rules Syntax Checker.
