Title: IBM SDK Installation gives "File Transfer Failure" message. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following message was received in the installer :

File Transfer Failure
Failed to copy file :
\sdk\cms_samples\java\common_class\com\cognos\developer\schemas\raas\Returns__by__Order__Method___x002d__Prompted__Chart\Returns__by__Order__Method___x002D__Prompted__Chart_ServiceLocator.class": No such file or directory.

Just clicking 'Skip' makes the installer continue without any further 
issues. 

In the logfile for the installer, this error is shown :
Error: Call to rename() failed for file "D:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\...... " etc.

You can check if in the particular installation under the SDK/cms_samples/java/common_class path as shown in the error, is the 
particular path to the folder 
Returns_by_Order_Method_x002d_Prompted_Chart folder with the right file 
in it. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
For IBM Cognos to evaluate attach these files to the Case : 

1. The CmpLst.txt file from the base Cognos_directory where Install is being done.
2. Zip up the complete instlog directory located in the same base directory, attach. 
3. Screen capture from My Computer => Preferences , showing Windows OS version,
Or do a uname -a , or lsb_release -i -r command on Unix / Linux.

For self diagnosis, the files in the ../instlog directory are the progress of installation.
They are named for the product, and have a date / timestamp in the name.
Review the tl-xx.....xxx.txt file where the error occurs and read the reason why the product installer have an issue.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The resolution of the error depends on what is actually happening. 

In this situation the product was installed on the system half a year earlier, and only now an upgrade with a FixPack was being done. 

In the mean time some files were deleted from the installed SDK Product, so when the installer was in progress, it discovered that the files it needed to replace were no longer there, the reason for the error during installation. 

Why and how the files were missing is a common occurrence in Operating Systems that have a GUI that manages files and folders. It is too easy to control click and cut or delete, move a file between folders and move whole folders with files accidentally. This was the situation for the missing files.
