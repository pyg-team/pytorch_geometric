    *****************
   client needs GL merge to take place in issues and transfer app
   note from Julio:
   The GLAccount fields should not be fully qualified or you won't
   know if the
   merge is working.  I left the first 2 components with "?".  Only
   the
   components specified on the GLAccount should override those on
   the WO when
   the merge occurs.  If the GLAccount on the InvCost is fully
   qualified, it
   will completely override the GLAccount on the WO.
