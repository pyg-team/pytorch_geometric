ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The UrbanCode Release 6.1.2 jar file: ucr-plugin-util.jar can be
   used to create UrbanCode Release plug-ins. If it is used to
   create a UrbanCode Release client application that runs in a CDI
   (Context and Dependency Injection) 1.0 container, it causes
   errors that prevent the aplication from starting.
   
   Using a WebService application on IBM WebSphere Application
   Server 8.5.5.9 with Java 8 and a version of Java EE that
   includes CDI 1.0, the following error occurs at startup:
   
   [9/1/17 18:44:51:081 CEST] 0000008b AnnotatedElem E
