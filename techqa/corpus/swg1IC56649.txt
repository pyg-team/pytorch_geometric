APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installation of the MQ Client causes the JavaWebStart
   registration information to be overridden, which can cause
   existing customer applications to fail if they require JAVA
   features only available at a higher JVM level than provided by
   the MQ JRE installed for GSKit (1.4.2 at present).

   Additional keywords:
   ...\gskit\jre\javaws\JavaWebStart.dll
   gskit jre javaws javawebstart dll
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Re-register the JavaWebStart.dll to the initial value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All windows users of JavaWebStart who install the MQ Client
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   During the MQ Client install, a JRE is installed for use with
   GSKit. The install of this JRE registers unconditionally the
   JavaWebStart dll, which will overwrite any previous
   installation of it. In the case where an application used
   JavaWebStart and relied on functionality in the JVM which is
   only available at a higher level than that provided by the
   GSKit JRE, applications may cease to work after installing the
   MQ Client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ has been modified to not register the JavaWebStart during
   the GSKit JRE install, as it is not required for MQ
   functionality.
