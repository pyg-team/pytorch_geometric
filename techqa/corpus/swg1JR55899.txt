ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you migrate IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and use
   importWASConfig.py scripts to move an IBM WebSphere Application
   Server data source object that has more than one authDataAlias
   element, the script fails and you see the following error
   messages:
   ... ....
   If the data source, connection factory, activation specification
   or SIBus configuration you are about to import refers to some
   non-default resources like J2C authentication data, resource
   adapter,
   or JDBC provider, make sure that you have
   already created those resources. Continue? (Y/N):y
   **************************************
   INFO: The authentication alias for object with JNDI name
   jdbc/bpmmpf doesnot exist in target environment, create it
