Title: IBM Restarting the application server can cause delays opening RTS for the first time - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The first login to Rule Team Server (RTS) after a server bounce encounters a 15 minute delay before the RTS Homepage is loaded. 


CAUSE
It can happen when RTS is on a machine behind the firewall in a secured intranet environment. 

This is due to the connection attempt to the Online Help page on the external publib.boulder.ibm.com domain, triggered from OnlineHelpDescriptor.readURL. 

When the server has no internet access or it is blocked by a firewall, this connection could take 15 minutes before failing. 

When the connection is slow or not working at all, RTS keeps trying for about 15
minutes to connect to the Online Help page on http://publib.boulder.ibm.com [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com]


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
No relevant entries will be showed in the log file but in the javacore would typically shows entries like these ones: 


at java/net/PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) 
at java/net/PlainSocketImpl.doConnect (PlainSocketImpl.java:391) 
at java/net/PlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress (PlainSocketImpl.java:252) 
at java/net/PlainSocketImpl.connect 
....


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Deactivate the firewall while RTS starts up or give RTS enough permission to pass though it so that it will be able to connect to the Online Help site. 


Another option is to manually redirect the request to localhost. For example if you are under Linux you would add the following entry to the/etc/hosts file:

127.0.0.1 publib.boulder.ibm.com
