ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  About 4 days ago (9/29/05) it was observed the syncmgr_server
   process on two Windows VOB servers started using one entire CPU.
   We have been unable to stop this behavior. We have killed the
   process (it comes back within 1 minute). We have stopped then
   restarted Clearcase- again, it comes back.
   It appears one of the two machine may have run out of disk space
   where CC/MS is installed at one point in time. It indicates
   probably corruption:  " Invalid TJF file hdr".
   Trying to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.
   It is currently occuring on bread and neha.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Syncmgr_server process using all of 1 CPU on vob servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in ClearCase 7.0.0.0.
   When generating family health, if there were more then 256
   sync jobs to look at for a given replica, the code did not
   handle this well.  Generating family health can now handle
   large number of sync jobs.
