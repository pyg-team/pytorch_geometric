APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have setup a Linear Regression in IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0
   and Japanese UI.  The first instance runs fine, but if you
   recall the dialog using the tool-button, the variable boxes are
   compressed into a thin line.
   
   Workaround:  This issue has been replicated on Windows systems
   where the custom text size (DPI) has been set to 150%.
   Setting DPI back to 100% (or perhaps 125%) resolved the issue in
   those cases.
