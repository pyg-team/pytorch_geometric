APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently, by default, all authenticated users can perform write
   operations on specific folders of the WebDAV file store (public
   and user owned folders), as described here:
                   http://publib.boulder.ibm [http://publib.boulder.ibm]
   .com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent
   .doc_v615/admin/mash_webdav_store.html
   This fix will change that default so that only admin users can
   perform write operations to those folders.
   In order to enable access for all authenticated users again,
   please add the following custom property through WAS admin
   console
   resource environment provider 'WP ConfigService':
     filestore.writeaccess.allowed= true
   Please restart portal server after this change.
