PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The administrative console in IBM WebSphere Application Server will not open and the SystemOut.log file shows the following information:

This is the request to initialize the console servlet:

CAUSE
There are three possible causes:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The three solutions appear here starting with the solution to the problem that occurs most often to the problem that occurs least often. Work through them in the order listed. 


When you try to login to the administrative console, a prefrences.xml file is created in WAS_HOME\wstemp\user_dir. If creation of preferences.xml fails due to lack of disk space, it leaves prefrences.xml file with zero length. This zero length prefrences.xml file causes the SAXParseException Premature end of file.

a. Clean up the disk space problem.

b. Delete the WAS_HOME\wstemp\user_dir\prefrences.xml file 

c. Try to login to administrative console. This builds new prefrences.xml with correct data so you can login to the administrative console. 



 1. To resolve the issue:
    
    a. Disable WebSphere Application Server security by stopping WebSphere Application Server (Network Deployment and nodeagent).
    
    b. Make a backup copy of the WAS_HOME/config/cells/node name/security.xml file. 
    
    c. Edit the WAS_HOME/config/cells/node name/security.xml. Edit the line starting with "<security:Security" so that its enabled parameter is set to false and enforceJava2Security is set to false. Exit and save changes.
    
    d. Start WebSphere Application Server (Network Deployment and/or nodeagent).
    
    e. Start the administrative console.
    
    f. Expand System Administration section.
    
    g. Delete all Console Users and Console Groups that are not valid.
    
    h. Save the configuration.
    
    i. If this is a Federated Environment, perform a synchronization. Skip if this is a Base Environment.
    
    j. Enable security again.
    
    
 2. NOTE: Save your current configuration by executing the following command from the <WAS_HOME>/bin directory:
    
    For Windows platforms: backupConfig.bat
    For UNIX platforms: ./backupConfig.sh
    
    
 3. Uninstalling and reinstalling of the administrative console:
    
    a. Start the wsadmin tool from the WAS_HOME/bin directory:
    
    wsadmin.sh/bat -conntype NONE
    
    b. List all the applications:
    
    $AdminApp list
    
    Note: This shows all the applications installed. If you have more than one "adminconsole", uninstall all the adminconsole applications.
    
    c. Uninstall the administrative console:
    
    $AdminApp uninstall adminconsole
    
    d. Save the changes:
    
    $AdminConfig save
    
    e. List all the applications:
    
    $AdminApp list
    
    You should not see the administrative console listed.
    
    
    a. Install the administrative console:
    
    $AdminApp install $WAS_HOME/installableApps/adminconsole.ear "-node my_Base_Node -cell my_Cell -server server1 -appname adminconsole"
    
    
    b. Save the changes:
    
    $AdminConfig save
    
    c. List all the applications:
    
    $AdminApp list 


You now see the administrative console listed and can start it.
