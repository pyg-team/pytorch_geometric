   MS SMS used to install Lotus Notes, we are using script in the
   MSI to
   fix this problem as a workaround.
   
   Notes client installer removes Citrix single sign-on
   
   Citrix online plug-in is used to provide single sign-on
   capabilities
   for Citrix web clients.
   
   Installing Notes 8.5.2 and higher removes the Citrix single
   sign-on
   provider from
   HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order
   
   Provider name is PnSson.
   
   Windows XP SP3 32 bit
   4 - 8 GB RAM
   Notes 8.5.2 & 8.5.3
   Citrix Online plugin v12.1.0.30
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   
   - upgrade client, upgrades completed OK
   - Registry key checked for NetworkProvider\Order status  PNSSON
   exists
     in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order
   - client LOGOFF
   - subsequent client LOGON defeats Citrix env.signon( PNSSON is
   removed )
   - Citrix login not available
