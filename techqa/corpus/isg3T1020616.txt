ANSWER
 

If this BPXF135E RC97 RSN02100000 error is encountered, the file system is most likely already 
allocated to OMVS. If so, verify that you really want your job run. If 
you do, you will need to UNMOUNT the file system. The most convenient 
way to do that is to go into ISHELL (typically TSO ISH from an ISPF 
command line), select File_systems , select 1 (Mount table), place a U 
on the line with the file system you want to unmount, and hit ENTER.
