AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects all versions up to and including IBM SDK for Node.js v1.2.0.3 and open-source version v0.12.5 of the Node.js runtime in IBM Bluemix. The issue has been resolved in IBM SDK for Node.js v1.2.0.4 and open-source version v0.12.6 with Node.js Buildpack Version: 
To check which version of the Node.js runtime your Bluemix application is using, navigate to the "Files and Logs" for your application through the Bluemix UI. In the "logs" directory, check the "staging_task.log". You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running "cf files <appname> logs/staging_task.log". 

Look for the following lines:

-----> IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack _______

If the open-source version is v0.12.5 or below, and the buildpack version is v2.2-xxxxxxxx-xxxx, your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=0.12.6"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application.
