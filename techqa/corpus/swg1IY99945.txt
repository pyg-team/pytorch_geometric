PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A part of the documentation for Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR)
   server was missing. There was no information how to enable HTTP
   access to the console and common reporting portlet. Existing
   documents for Tivoli Integrated Portal (TIP) and ITNM contained
   such a description but one part related to TCR was missing
   there.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  "Configuring console access for HTTP and HTTPS" chapter has been
   added to the IBM Tivoli Common Reporting online documentation.
   The chapter is based on the relevant chapter from the TIP
   documentation. Missing configuration step for TCR portlet/viewer
   application has been added.
