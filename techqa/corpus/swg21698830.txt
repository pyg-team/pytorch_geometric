Title: IBM Mashup - CMS requests with AJAX fail with HTTP Error 401 in Chrome and Firefox - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I getting these errors for Chrome or Firefox, IE is working good ?
HTTP status code 401

Chrome : 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. 
Origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access. 

Firefox :
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading
the remote resource at 
http://ServerDomain:Port/C1022/cgi-bin/cognosisapi.dll/rds/promptPage/path/Public%20Folders/BI/Work%20In%20Progress/TestReport_Prompt 

CAUSE
Configuration of Browsers and Webservers is not allowing CORS requests.

ANSWER
This problem happens by modern design of the Browsers and Webservers, not related to IBM Cognos product. 

This can be fixed by moving the requested resource to the same domain or by enabling CORS = Cross Origin Resource Sharing in Webserver and Browser


IE / IIS has this enabled in the Browser / Webserver chain, if this is working there. 

See : http://enable-cors.org for more information for both Servers and Clients. 

For Browsers check the Browser Support sites, as this very likely could be an internal setting.
