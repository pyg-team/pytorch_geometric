   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Access the situation editor from the TEP and select the product
   provided
   MS_Offline situation.
   
   Click on the Add conditions button from the Formula tab.  The
   Select
   condition window will display Orgin Node within the Attribute
   item pane.
   
   Select the Origin Node attribute item and specify a value.
   
   Attempt to (re)start the situation and the messages mentioned
   above will
   be issued to the HUB's RAS1 trace log.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The Name attribute item contains the same value Origin Node
   attribute so it can be used equivalently.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Availability type situation(s) fails to start when the Orgin
   Node attribute is specified.
   
   
   The following message is issued to the HUB monitoring server
   operations/MSG2 log when the Origin Node attribute is specified
   for an availability type situation:
   
   mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss KO41052    Monitoring for enterprise situation
   MS_Offline paused due to unresolved attributes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The dockib file has been changed to not externalize the Origin
   Node attribute when authoring or modifying an availability type
   situation.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0005
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The Name attribute item contains the same value Origin Node
   attribute so it can be used equivalently.
