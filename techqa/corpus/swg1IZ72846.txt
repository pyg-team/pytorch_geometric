ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Wrong message or null message when using work-manager based
   navigation.
   When the WPS is configured to use work-manager based navigation,
   the following use of the BPC EJB API may result in
   messages or variables showing wrong or null data objects:
   a) The local BPC EJB API is used
   b) The input message of a human task or business process is
   submitted using the local BPC EJB API
   c) The input message is used in java code after it has been
   submitted to BPC for further processing
   .
   Reason: The work-manager based navigation comes with an object
   cache for efficient read access to data objects. In the scenario
   described, without the i-fix, a reference to the data object in
   the inter transaction cache is passed to the client making the
   local EJB calls. Later use of the data object may occur by the
   client code and by the BPC container, which leads to wrong or
   null data.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Possible workaround without installing the i-fix: Set the inter
   transaction cache size to 0; this will prevent the data (input
   message e.g.) to be cached and re-used for later operations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem will be fixed
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix will be include in V620 FP3
