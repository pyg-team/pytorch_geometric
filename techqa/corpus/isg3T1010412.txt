QUESTION
 
An SMP/E APPLY job failed with the following errors when trying to apply RMM maintenance:

CAUSE
The SMP/E messages indicate that an error exists in the relationship between an element in the indicated SYSMODs (PTFs) being installed and elements in other SYSMODs that have already been installed or that are being installed concurrently. After a check of all the PRE and SUP statements of all of the affected PTFs, all were found to be in order. 

The problem was caused a week earlier when a previous APPLY job was cancelled because the spool filled up and locked the system. Certain parts for the PTFs in question got installed prior to the spool filling up during the earlier APPLY job. During the second APPLY the following week, PTFs containing the same parts as those that got missed when the spool filled up were hit by PTFs at a higher level resulting in the MODID errors being seen. A LIST of the mods affected show that the RMIDs were not updated. The mod output showed that the RMID was not the PTF number of the last PTF applied. 



ANSWER
Perform an APPLY REDO of all of the PTFs affected by the spool filling up. Then, re-do all of the applies that were done since the time that the spool filled up. Afterwards, a listing of all SYSMODs should show no PTFs are in ERRor status.
