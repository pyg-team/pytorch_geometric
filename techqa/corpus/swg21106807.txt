PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to know what the names are for WebSphere MQ and MQSeries jobs for the IBM i platform. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Websphere MQ 8.0 jobs:
AMQALMPX The checkpoint processor that periodically takes journal checkpoints.
AMQZMUC0 Utility manager. This job executes critical queue manager utilities, for example the journal chain manager.
AMQZXMA0 The execution controller that is the first job started by the queue manager. 
It handles MQCONN requests, and starts agent processes to process WebSphere MQ API calls.
AMQZFUMA Object authority manager (OAM).
AMQZLAA0 Queue manager agents that perform most of the work for applications that connect to the queue manager using MQCNO_STANDARD_BINDING.
AMQZLSA0 Queue manager agent.
AMQZMUF0 Utility Manager
AMQZMGR0 Process controller. This job is used to start up and manage listeners and services.
AMQZMUR0 Utility manager. This job executes critical queue manager utilities, for example the journal chain manager.
AMQFQPUB Queued publish/subscribe daemon.
AMQFCXBA Broker worker job.
RUNMQBRK Broker control job.
AMQRMPPA Channel process pooling job.
AMQCRSTA TCP/IP-invoked channel responder.
AMQCRS6B LU62 receiver channel and client connection (see note).
AMQRRMFA Repository manager for clusters.
AMQCLMAA Non-threaded TCP/IP listener.
AMQPCSEA PCF command processor that handles PCF and remote administration requests.
RUNMQTRM Trigger monitor.
RUNMQDLQ Dead letter queue handler.
RUNMQCHI The channel initiator.
RUNMQCHL Sender channel job that is started for each sender channel.
RUNMQLSR Threaded TCP/IP listener.
AMQRCMLA Channel MQSC and PCF command processor.

WebSphere MQ 5.3 jobs:

STRSBS SBS(QMQM) 

Start QMGR - STRMQM

Queue manager is active if WRKUSRJOB QMQM *ACTIVE shows some or all of
following jobs:

AMQALMPX .....Checkpoint process
AMQRRMFA..... Repository mgr for clusters 
AMQZFUMA......OAM manager (security)
AMQZLAA0......Agent process
AMQZXMA0......Execution controller 
RUNMQCHI .....Channel initiator (Started using SYSTEM.CHANNEL.INITQ)
AMQZDMAA......Deferred MQPUT processor(Used internally by MQ) 

Other jobs which must be started by way of a command are
RUNMQLSR......Threaded listener (this is NOT the default) - STRMQMLSR 
AMQCLMAA......Non-threaded listener (this IS the default) - STRMQMLSR
RUNMQTRM......Trigger monitor started for triggered appls - STRMQMTRM
AMQPCSEA......Command server - STRMQMCSVR
RUNMQCHL......Sender channel - STRMQMCHL
AMQCRSTA......Receiver channel (Active when non-threaded listener being used)

ENDMQM ENDCCTJOB(*NO)
NOTE: Will end all jobs except for: RUNMQLSR or the AMQCLMAA jobs must
issue ENDMQMLSR to end listener jobs after ENDMQM completes

ENDMQM ENDCCTJOB(*YES) 
NOTE: Will end all jobs including the listeners. 

MQSeries pre-V5.x: 
AMQHIXK4 - Storage Manager (Housekeeper) 
AMQMCPRA - Data Store (Object Cache) 
AMQCLMAA - Listener 
AMQALMP4 - Check Point Process 
AMQRMCLA - Sender channel 
AMQCRSTA - TCP/IP Receiver channel and Client Connection 
AMQCRS6A - LU62 Receiver channel and Client Connection 
AMQPCSVA - PCF command processor 
AMQRIMNA - Channel initiator (trigger monitor to start channel)
