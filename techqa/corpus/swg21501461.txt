Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Using the sample "customerulereport" it is possible to generate reports in different formats. How to save the report as HTML on the local file system as it was possible with JRules 6.7.x ? 

ANSWER
The sample attached is a Rule Studio plugin that adds a contextual pop-up menu on Rule Projects. The new menu item is labeled "HTML Business Rule Report". When this action is selected the user is prompted for a file location to export the rule report to. The report is then generated and saved to the HTML file, with a folder "images" to contain the pictures for ruleflow and decision trees in particular. 

The plugin can be installed by dropping the folder named "htmlrulereport_1.0.0" found in the htmlrulereport.zip file into: 

 *  <JRules_Installation_Directory>/studio/eclipse/plugins (for JRules 7.0.x and JRules 7.1.x) 
 * <ODM_Installation_Directory>/dropins (for WODM 7.5.x and ODM 8.x)


And then restart Rule Studio / Rule Designer.
