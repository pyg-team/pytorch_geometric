LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All user of IBM Integration Bus Toolkit V10.0 and the mapping
   node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows on x86-64 platform, Linux on x86-64 platform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   There is a noticeable performance degradation between V8 of V10
   of the toolkit when using the mapping node.
   It was discovered that in V10 , that two plugins are registered
   for updates from the map and each of those plugins were
   refreshing the validation.  This meant the validation was called
   twice for each change.
   
   A second issue was that V10 had increased the xpath validation
   that occurred each time a map was changed when compared to V8.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Vers ion 9.0.  For

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now ensures that only one plugin will deal with the
   change events on the map.
   
   For second issue, a preference has been added to XML Mapping
   Editor -> xpath preference panel which reduces the xpath
   validation back to the same level as GDM 104, shipped in
   previous Toolkit releases.  The option is called "Improve Map
   editor response time by only performing full validation on
   saving the map."  By default, the option is turned off.
