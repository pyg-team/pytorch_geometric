QUESTION
 Does WebSphere Transformation Extender assign the default attribute parameter from an XML Schema (.xsd)? 

CAUSE
How does WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) validate and build an XML Schema attribute with a default value assigned to the attribute similar to the following?

<xs:attribute name="IBMProduct" type="xs:string" default="WTX"/>



ANSWER
This particular default schema entry is optional by design and the functionality of WTX observes that these are optional so these fields are valid being empty. When used within a WTX map, this attribute would appear as IBMProduct(0:1) in a map opened with the Design Studio. 


You would think that this default value in the schema would cause the default value of "WTX" to be assigned but in this case since these types of items are optional on input as denoted by the (0:1), any input XML data from a WTX perspective is valid with or without the data being present. 

The design of WTX is such that it does not assign default values to optional data. If WTX automatically assigned the data, there would be no way to create XML data without these fields.

It is up to the map developer to decide if they want data in these fields. If the map developer wants data in these fields then a map rule will need to be defined with the default data value for these fields.
