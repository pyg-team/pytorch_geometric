Title: IBM Unable to view images in HTML reports in Mozilla - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 Why are images in HTML reports generated by Reporter Plus not displayed correctly in Mozilla? 

CAUSE
This happens because the diagrams are generated in "emf" format by IBM Rational Rhapsody Reporter Plus when generating html reports. These "emf" files are not supported in Mozilla. Hence, the pictures are not displayed. 

ANSWER
The workaround to this would be to use Internet Explorer. 

In order to overcome this limitation, change the picture format of these diagrams in the generated reports. Please access the Registry key value "DiagramPictureFormat" which can be found in the path: 


[My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Telelogic\Telelogic Rhapsody ReporterPlus 7.5\Settings].


Change the value from "emf" to "jpg" or "bmp".
