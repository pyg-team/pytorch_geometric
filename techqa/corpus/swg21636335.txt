PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of WebGUI fails with error in MachinePlan_localhost.log relating to ESSServer.post.install.xml and wsadmin.out reports a FileNotFound exception for configureESS.py 

CAUSE
This error will occur when the ESS Server component has not been cleaned up properly from a previous installation (successful or failed).

/.coi

/usr/.ibm/.nif
