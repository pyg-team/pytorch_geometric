APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the previous R19 (and the current R20 environment) there
   is no need to install the Bizztalk adapters or the IBM
   Webspehere Integration since they are not being used for this
   gateway configuration.
   After upgrading to v5R20 sp4 I started the process of
   installing SmarTeam Gateway Server. During the installation
   process on the Gateway Server I am unable to install the
   Gateway client. When I attempt to install the Gateway client
   I receive the following message ??? The Installation didn???t
   detect an installation of IBM WebSpehere Business Integration
   on the local machine??? and am unable to proceed with the
   client installation on the Gateway server.
   Then, from the Client workstation running SmarTeam editor
   with the Gateway client installed, and the database
   connection set to Gateway. When a new Item is created there
   is not an xml file generated in the c:\Gateway-Polling
   location, and there are no error messages generated that
   indicate what the problem maybe.
   1. The error I am receiving happens on ANY operation for
   Items that I have defined in the Gateway Integration Manager.
   This would include;
   ??? Adding an Item
   ??? Updating an Item
   ??? Life Cycle operation on an Item
   ??? Item Promotions
   2. The Problem that I am having is that the XML files for any
   of the above operations are not being generated from SmarTeam
   Gateway.
   3. Yes, I have attached a screen shot of the error message
   from the Gateway server. This error happens each time any
   conditions is met in the Gateway Operation Mapping. I believe
   that this is a problem with the inability to install the
   Gateway client on the Gateway server. Each time you attempt
   to install the Gateway client on the Gateway server you
   receive the error message stating ???No IBM WebShere Business
   Integration Detected on the local machine??? when this error
   happens the installation process cannot continue.
   4. I have also generated the required Schema selecting only
   the classes I have defined in the Gateway Integration
   mapping, and yes I did set the schema to XDR (XML
   Data-Reduced)
   So the first question would be - Is IBM WebShere Business
   Integration now required for Gateway in R20?
   If not, why can the VAR not install the Gateway Client on the
   Gateway Server?
   Why are the XML files not being generated in the defined
   E:\Gateway-Polling\input directory?
   You can see all relevant screenshots and Gateway setup info
   contained in the DOC attached to this SR.  Also included in
   the DOC are the installation error and the Event Viewer error
   generated when the VAR manually tried to push an XML file.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON V5R20 SP6.
   Additional Closure Information:
   Issue fixed in ENOVIA SmarTeam with change from MSxml library
   to MSxml3 to support the MSxml3 format.
