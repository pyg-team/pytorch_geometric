PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why do I receive "SECJ7782E: You cannot install an application across multiple security domains" error when trying to deploy IBM Content Navigator using the configuration tool? 

CAUSE
Existing Security Domain associated with IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster is a possible cause of the failure. 

IBM WebSphere Application Server has the ability to define additional Security Domains that can override a subset of the global security settings. These domains can be used to provide customized security settings for applications and service integration buses. A Security Domain has a scope that defines where its settings are applicable. Settings that are not defined in the domain default to the global security settings.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the security domain listed IBM WebSphere Application Server and its association. 

 * Security->Security Domains 
 * Open security domain and check if it is associated with IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster.
   
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A Security Domain can be scoped to an entire cell, or to a specific set of servers, clusters, or service integration buses. Therefore, multiple security domains can be used to allow security settings to vary from one application to another application. Security settings that apply to an application will be defined by the following scope: 


1. If the application is running on a server or cluster that is within the scope of a security domain, those settings will be used. Security settings that are not defined in this domain will be taken from the global security settings (not a cell-level domain).

2. If the application is running on a server or cluster that is not within the scope of a security domain, but a security domain has been defined at the cell scope, that domain will be used. Security settings that are not defined in this domain will be taken from the global security settings.

3. If the previous conditions do not apply, the global domain settings will be used. Note that you can enable or disable application security at the domain and global level, so just falling within a domain does not necessarily mean that application security is enabled. Also, note that naming operations always use the global security configuration. 

 

Follow the instructions below to successfully deploy IBM Content Navigator on WebSphere Application Server with Security Domains. 

 * Using WebSphere Administration Console go to Security->Security Domains. 
 * Open security domain and check if it is associated with IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster. 
 * If the IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster is associated with the Security Domain, uncheck the check box for the Node or Cluster and save the changes. 
 * Rerun the deployment of IBM Content Navigator. 
 * Restart WebSphere Application Server(full restart). 
 * Re-associate the IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster with the security domain.
