APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After installation FixPack 1 on 8.0.1 version, users cannot use
   language localization ( specifically noticed with regard to
   Russian ) in the ProcessPortal. As a result, even when a user
   changes the language in their portal preferences, everything is
   still seen in English.
   
   When this issue occurs, you will see a 'Failed to initialize
   registry' message when a profile is upgraded from 8010 to 8011.
   Creating a new profile on 8011 does not result in the same
   message. This problem caused by the resource bundle id not
   being updated when upgrading from 8010 to 8011, so the new
   resource bundle will not get imported to the database. A patch
   is required for the bootstrap code to resolve this behavior.
   After applying the fix the bootstrap must be done again with
   the patched code.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Partial workaround: export localization from 8.0.1 Process
   Portal App and then import it to the 8.0.1.1 version. After
   deployment of new snapshot on server, changing language changes
   display language in most areas. However, installation of new
   snapshot doesn't help to translate header of report page with
   action links Save, Manage EPV and Export - which still display
   in English.

   ****************************************************************
   After installing fix pack 1 on V8.0.1, users cannot use the
   language localization feature in Process Portal. This issue
   was specifically noticed regarding Russian. Even when a user
   changes the language in the preferences, everything is still
   displayed in English. When this issue occurs, users see a
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;Failed to initialize registry &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189; message when a prof
   upgraded from V8.0.1. to V8.0.1.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem occurs because the resource bundle ID is not
   updated when users upgrade from V8.0.1 to V8.0.1.1; therefore,
   the new resource bundle is not imported into the database. A
   fix for IBM BPM V8.0.1.1 is available so that the resource
   bundle ID is updated.
