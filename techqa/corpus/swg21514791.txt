QUESTION
 Is there an easy listing of all octigate tables available in ITCAM for Application Diagnostics v7.1? 

ANSWER
There's no built-in schema tool available to get a listing of the octigate tables and their relationship hierarchies. You'll have to use one of the many tools available on the Internet to create a schema listing of the octigate database. One of the common ones I've seen used is SchemaSpy available here:
http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/] 

The ITCAM octigate database consists of 67 tables (as of 7.1.0.2.5 (7.1 FP2 + IF5 release)). Here's a listing of all the tables in the database if you want to use your own SQL queries against the database.
