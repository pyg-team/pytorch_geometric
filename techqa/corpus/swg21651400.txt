Title: IBM Unable to send events to Tivoli EIF probe using portmapper - United States

Text:
portmapper; postemsg; nco_p_tivoli_eif TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli EIF probe fails to send events when using postemsg -S <EIF Server>


SYMPTOM
When events are sent using the config file the probe receives the events, but when the postemsg -S option is used, the probe fails to receive events.


CAUSE
 Whenpostemsg -S is called, the portmapper service is used, and needs to be configured properly.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check that events are seen when the portmapper service is not use, as there may be other issues causing event failure, such as firewalls or name resolution.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The probe will need to be registered with the portmapper on the server where the Tivoli EIF probe is running; Make sure that portmapper is configured on the probe server. 


If you are usingrcpbind, you should be replacing it with portmapper.
