ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With multiple SSP servers defined in RES, running test suites
   in Decision Center Business Console will some times show " The
   server for executing the scenarios of the test suite cannot be
   found" in the status bar during execution, the test runs
   successfully at the end, with the same error remaining in the

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Here when there are multiple SSP servers used, running test
   suites in business console will sometimes have the following
   behavior : status bar shows that "server cannot be found"
   during execution, so to prevent this situation we need to run
   monitoring server scan to stop when the appropriate server is
   founded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
