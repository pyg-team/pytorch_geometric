APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Docker containers cannot be updated using PureApplication
   Service 2.2.2.1.
   For a pattern with Docker container IBM Integration Bus
   v10.0.0.6 and IIB container v10.0.0.7 in private Docker
   registry, no new versions of IIB container are available.
   
   In instance console: Operations > Container part > Update image,
   no new version of IIB container appears, so it cannot be
   updated.
   
   The docker registry certificate file location has already been
   changed on the virtual machine (VM), but the operation is still
   looking for the old path.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The work around is manually copy the  certificate file to the
   old path.
   Run this command on the VM (should be all on one line).
   cp
   /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/wl169050150136.pureapplication.
   ibmcloud.com.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   Then reopen the management console and select the operation
   again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The certificate location needs to be updated to the
   new location in the updated docker code.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System and
   BlueMix Local System version 2.2.3.0.
