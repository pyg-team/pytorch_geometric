QUESTION
 How can I enable Case Foundation Case Analyzer 5.2.1 reporting of Case Manager 5.2.1 solution properties without the Audit Configuration Wizard? 

CAUSE
Please note: You must be a system administrator to apply the following procedures. Familiarity with the following is required: 

 * Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE); 
 * General installation steps for IBM Case Manager; 
 * General installation and administration skills for the Content Engine, Case Manager, and integrating components that are configured on your system (such as Case History, Case Analyzer, etc.).

ANSWER
To enable Case Analyzer reporting of Case Manager solution properties, you have to complete the following activities: 

 1. Ensure audit logging is enabled for the target object store. 
 2. Configure the solution property to log events. This activity takes two steps:  1. Assign the property to the Creation Event, Update Event, and Deletion Event subclasses. 
     2. Enable auditing of the property.
    
    
 3. Add the solution property to the Case Analyzer configuration.


NOTE: You can click on the images below to see their enlarged versions. 

To ensure audit logging is enabled for the target object store: 

Log into ACCE.  1. Navigate to Object Stores -> [Target Object Store] and click on the [Target Object Store] node in the navigation pane. 
 2. Click on the General tab on the right-hand side. 
 3. Scroll down to find the Enable auditing property. 
 4. If the Enable auditing property is set to False, then change it to Yes, and click the Save button.

To configure the solution property to log events: 

First, in Case Manager, make sure the properties are defined in the solution, added to a case type, and the solution is deployed. 

Assign the property to the Creation Event, Update Event, and Deletion Event subclasses:  1. Log into ACCE. 
 2. Navigate to Object Stores -> [Target Object Store] and click on the [Target Object Store] node in the navigation pane. 
 3. Navigate to the Data Design -> Classes -> Other Classes -> Event -> Object Change Event node. 
 4. Under the Object Change Event node, click on the Creation Event node in the navigation pane. 
 5. Click on the Property Definitions tab. 
 6. Click on the Add button. 
 7. In the Add Properties dialog, find the solution property and click the check box to the left of the property name. Then click OK.
    In the example below, we are performing this step for the Creation Event for two properties: testCAIntProp and testCAStringProp:
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=2] 
 8. Click the Save button.
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=3] 
 9. Repeat steps 4-8 just above for the Update Event and Deletion Event. Click their corresponding nodes under the Object Change Event node in the ACCE navigation pane.


Enable auditing of the property:  1.  While in ACCE, make sure the [Target Object Store] tab is displayed on the right-hand side. You can close the all the other tabs. 
 2.  In the ACCE navigation pane, navigate to the [Target Object Store] -> Classes -> Folder -> Base Case -> Case Folder node. 
 3.  Under the Case Folder node, click on the [Case Type Name] node, where [Case Type Name] is the name of the case type that the solution property is added to. Now a new [Case Type Name] tab is displayed on the right-hand side. 
 4.  Click on the Properties tab. 
 5.  Find the Property Definitions property. Click on the Property Definitions drop-down list, and find the solution property on the list, and click on it. Now a new [Property Name] tab is displayed on the right-hand side, where [Property Name] is the name of the solution property.
     In the example below, we are performing this step for a case type called CATestCaseType, and we can see the two solution properties we worked on in the previous procedure above: testCAIntProp and testCAStringProp.
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=4] 
 6.  Find the Audit As property and click in its edit box. 
 7.  While the Audit As property is displayed on the [Property Name] tab on the right-hand side, scroll down in the navigation pane to find the Property Templates node under [Target Object Store] -> Data Design. 
 8.  Expand the Property Templates node (this may take a while if there are a lot of Property templates defined in the target object store), and find the node for the solution property. 
 9.  Right-click the solution property, and select Copy Object Reference.
     In the example below, we are performing this step for the property called testCAStringProp:
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=5] 
 10. On the right-hand side, click in the edit box for the Audit As property again and click the drop-down arrow to the fight. Select Paste Object. Now the Audit As property value should show the name of the solution property. 
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=6]
     Successful result:
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=7]
     IMPORTANT: Do not close the [Property Name] tab! Otherwise this configuration change will be lost. 
 11. While the [Property Name] tab is still open: click on the [Case Type Name] tab. The Save button on this tab should be enabled as a result of changing the Audit As property value for the solution property on the [Property Name] tab. Click the Save button.
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=8] 
 12. Now you can close both the [Property Name] tab and the [Case Type Name] tab.


Add the solution property to the Case Analyzer configuration: 
 1. Start the Case Analyzer Process Task Manager by running the captm.bat or captm.sh (UNIX/LINUX) script. The script is located in the [Content Platform Engine installation directory]/tools/PE directory. 
 2. Expand the top-level [P8 domain name] node down to the Data Fields node in the navigation pane. 
 3. Right-click the Data Fields node and select New. 
 4. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695098&aid=9] 
 5. In the Data Field Wizard dialog, select the 'Use Content Engine field as a template' option and click Next. 
 6. On the next screen, click on the drop-down arrow for the Field Name box, and select the solution property you want to add to the Case Analyzer configuration. Click Next.  * Optionally, you can specify a different name to be displayed for this property on the Case Analyzer reports in the Unique Name edit box. 
     * NOTE: the field name you enter in the Unique Name edit box must be unique in the Case Analyzer store.
    
    
 7. On the next screen, choose if you want to add a Dimension or a Measure. Click Next.  * NOTE: the Measure option is greyed out if the type of the property is not appropriate for a Measure field in Case Analyzer.
    
    
 8. If OLAP is enabled for Case Analyzer: on the next screen, choose if you want to add the property to both Case Analyzer cubes and fact tables, or to the fact tables only. 
 9. If you chose to add the property to both Case Analyzer cubes and fact tables: on the next screen, select the Case Analyzer cubes you want to add the property to. Then click Finish.


After successfully adding the property, the Case Analyzer Process Task Manager will display the new Case Analyzer fields. The message pane at the bottom of the Process Task Manager will show success messages. For example, the screenshot below shows that we added an integer property called testCAIntProp as a measure, and a string property called testCAStringProp as a dimension (TGS2 is the solution prefix in Case Manager):
