ABSTRACT
 SupportPac CA0D can be used to demonstrate how to expose a legacy CICS Transaction Server for z/OS application to a mobile front-end by using IBM Worklight as the mobile framework. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
See What's new (V1.1) to see changes that were made to this SupportPac (CA0D) on 22 July 2014.



SupportPac CA0D demonstrates a mobile application* that interacts with existing CICS SupportPac CB12: GENAPP, a General Insurance Application [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031760] that is used to demonstrate new features and capabilities of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS), while maintaining a legacy style of application.

*Example mobile applications are provided by this SupportPac that can run on mobile devices that support the following operating systems: 

 * Google Android 
 * RIM BlackBerry OS 
 * Apple iOS 
 * Microsoft Windows Phone

Architecture and functions 
The mobile application delivered by SupportPac CA0D is a sample of a style that a typical customer of the GENAPP insurance company would download to their mobile device. Customers would then use the 'app' to check their policies and also to make claims against those policies. 

Figure 1: GENAPP (CB12) architecture

[1] and [2] The mobile device connects to IBM Worklight server. Authentication is carried out against an IBM DB2 database that is installed and using table CUSTOMER_SECURE authentication a hashed password for a user is validated.

[3] and [4] Communication between the Worklight client and the CICS back end happens through Worklight adapters. An adapter checks authentication and, if successful, starts a web service with either SOAP or JSON, by using the CICS TS Feature Pack for Mobile Extensions V1.0 [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/mobile/].

An example of using the Apple iOS notification framework (APNS) or the Google Android cloud notification framework (C2DM), is included as part of the Worklight project and is driven by the CICS Business Event (GENAPPNotificationEvent Processing project). The notification that is driven by the CICS Event Processing event starts a Worklight adapter that is called Claim Notification and sends claim details between users of the application.



Possible uses
Users of the mobile application provided by SupportPac CA0D can: 

 * View their policies (only the single most recently created policy for Home, Car, or Endowment for each user) - illustrating use of the web services SOAP or JSON. 
 * Purchase a new Home, Car, or Endowment policy if they do not own one - illustrating use of the web services SOAP or JSON. 
 * Start a claim against another customer - illustrating push notifications using CICS Event Processing.
   


Skill level required 
Intermediate, with knowledge of CICS and supporting systems configuration, operation, and applications. 

What's new (V1.1)? 

 * Project upgraded to be compatible with IBM Worklight V6.1 
 * Push notification race conditions have been fixed 
 * HTML page is now more stream-lined 
 * Various other minor bug fixes
