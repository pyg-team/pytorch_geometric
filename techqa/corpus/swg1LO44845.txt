APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customers have consistently complained about the slowness of
   MIME Emails
   A customer in the forum indicated the IE blacklists could
   significantly
   contribute to the slowdown as we use IE for body rendering.
   
   The customer's post is below.
   
   We need to investigate whether we can improve the performance of
   the Mail use
   case, as well as other usages of the embedded browser where it
   is used to view
   local content.   It must be done without introducing security
   vulnerabilities.

   Updated to 8.5 and had very poor performance in opening emails.
   It was the
   worse for HTML based emails.  After a bunch of research, I used
   Procmon from
   Microsoft's sysinternals utilities and found that I was running
   through the
   list of restricted web sites that is set in Internet Explorer.
   I cleared the
   1000 or so sites listed in the list via the registry and my
   email is moving
   much faster.  Many spyware products will add known sites to the
   restricted list
   and it looked like that Notes was reviewing each one during
   opening email.
   
   Don't know if this will help anyone else, but figured I would
   pass it along.
