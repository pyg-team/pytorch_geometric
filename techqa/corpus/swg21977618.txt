REMEDIATION/FIXES
The IBM Client Application Access (ICAA) SLOTH vulnerability is tracked as SPR KLYHA5YRVP and a fix is introduced in ICAA 1.0.0.1 Interim Fix 1. You can download the Interim Fix from the ICAA tab of the following technote: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963] 


Note: You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables MD5 signature hash by default. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 signature hash and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
