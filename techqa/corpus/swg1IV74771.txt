APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If nci_import is run to import a project that contains a
   datasource and this datasoource already exists on the taget
   system, the datasource username is not seen as changed in the
   GUI to that contained in the import unless the Impact server is
   restarted.
   The documentation only states that the Impact server needs to
   be restarted when the import includes the OMNIbusEventReader
   service, but it needs to be restarted in the circumstances
   described here too.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart Impact server after import.
