ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: View Access page in Identity Service Center(ISC)
   interface showing unexpected results
   
   Description: When looking at the View Access page in ISC to show
   accesses on some user, the results are showing entries for
   accesses that have alread been removed/deleted from the user.
   The page is showing the current accesses on the user and also
   showing accesses that were removed from the user in the past.
   The removed access are showing as pending access requests, but
   they are not pending and completed already in ISIM.
   
   Steps to Duplicate: In ISIM define some accesses on some
   service group or roles.  Then request one or more of the
   accesses for some user in ISIM.  The later delete/remove the
   access from user in ISIM.  In the ISC interface display the
   View Access page for the user and see entries for the past
   removed/deleted accesses that show like pending access
   requests.
   
   Desired Behavior: The ISC interface on the View Access page
   should accurately show the current accesses on the user in
   ISIM.  Previously removed/deleted accesses from user should not
   show as pending access requests.
   
   Environment: ISIM 6.0 FP3
