Title: IBM Cannot launch the WebSphere Application Server v6.x in profiling mode because WebSphere Application Server fails to load piAgent module - United States

Text:
JVMJ9VM011W; piAgent; ADMU3200I; ADMU3011E; Server launched; Waiting for initialization status; Server launched but failed initialization; startServer.log; JVMJ9VM011W; Unable to load piAgent; 1288832 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 To successfully start WebSphere速 Application Server (WAS) version 6.x in profiling mode, the WAS process needs to launch the piAgent module object. In some cases, operating systems such as Linux速 or Microsoft速 Windows速 cannot locate the module. This technote tells how to resolve messages that display in the Rational Application Developer (RAD) or Rational Software Architect (RSA) console view and the WAS native_stderr.log. 

SYMPTOM
Below are the common messages that display in the Rational Application Developer (RAD) or Rational Software Architect (RSA) console view and the WAS native_stderr.log.

Error message from console view: 

 

ADMU3200I: Server launched. Waiting for initialization status.
ADMU3011E: Server launched but failed initialization. startServer.log,
SystemOut.log(or job log in zOS) and other log files under
C:\Program
Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v6x\profiles\AppSrv01\logs\server1
should contain failure information.


Error message from native_stderr.log: 

JVMJ9VM011W Unable to load piAgent: The specified module could not be found. Could not create the Java virtual Machine.



CAUSE
WAS server fails to load piAgent module.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

 1. Ensure Test and Performance Tools Platform (TPTP) feature is installed. You can find installed features in the Installation Manager Modify Package window. 
 2. Search for piAgent.dll in <SDPShared>\plugins directory.
    If there are multiple piAgent.dll files in <SDPShared>\plugins, select the one that has the latest time stamp. 
    Example: C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70Shared\plugins\org.eclipse.hyades.execution.win32.x86_4.2.3.v200701141614<[/code>] 
 3. Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced tab > Environment Variable 
 4. Add C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70Shared\plugins\org.eclipse.hyades.execution.win32.x86_4.2.3.v200701141614< to PATH variable. 
 5. Relaunch RAD (or RSA) and start WTE in profile mode.

If the native_stderr.log contains a different massage, contact IBM Support for further assistance.
