LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ==>Users viewing the versions of a document in the Document List
   Coach view, when connected to IBM BPM Document store, will
   notice that the technical user (ie. tw_admin) will be shown as
   the user in the 'created by' field, when it should in fact be
   the user claiming the task.
   
   AFFECTED EDITIONS:
   ==>IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.0 Advanced, Standard and
   Express
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   ==>Affects users viewing the versions of a document in the
   document list coach view when connected to IBM BPM Document
   storeThis problem occurs because there is a technical user (ie.
   tw_admin) which performs ECM operations on the behalf of the
   user claiming the task. As a result, the ECM server will believe
   that the technical user is the one who created the version and
   return that as the versions result.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   ==>To fix this issue, changes were will be made in the ECM Get
   All Document Versions service, by adding a script task which
   uses the IBM_BPM_Document_UserId field, of the IBM BPM Document,
   to resolve the correct 'created by' user. This is done only when
   connected to the IBM BPM Document store.
   
   A fix is planned for a future V8.5 release.
