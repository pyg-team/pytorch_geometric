APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As openstack keystone is installed/upgraded by the fixpack the
   old config file (keystone.conf) is saved to
   keystone.conf.rpmsave before installing a new one. Later when
   making further changes to the config file it is backup'ed again
   by chef to /var/chef/backup but this is only a copy of the new
   config file created by the yum/rpm/ install.
   .
   The ICO documentation does not go far enough, we must also
   mention the backup copies stored as rpmsave (please note that
   depending on the rpm package logic the original config file is
   either stored as .rpmsave and a new one is installed, or the
   original one is kept and the new one is stored as .rpmnew).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   ****************************************************************
   
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4 documentation using it
   as reference for update to next fix pack.
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4 FP3 update documentation does not
   point out correct OpenStack configuration file backup.
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   Review the next update of SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.4
   Information Center when available (FP4).
   Rough overview of the documentation changes can also be found in
   the conclusion section below.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  * PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   With FP3 upgrade a OpenStack RPM package get installed. The RPM
   install itself make a backup copy of OpenStack configuration
   files.
   Since the RPM install get executed before the chef driven
   upgrade procedure, the backup executed by chef copies the
   already replaced once.
   To get a simple procedure independent of individual component
   backup procedures it is recommended to take manual backup of the
   OpenStack configuration files before all upgrade execution.
