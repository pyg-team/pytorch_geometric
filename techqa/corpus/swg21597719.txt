Title: IBM Changing Java versions in Rule Studio or Rule Designer causes compilation errors - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I see compilation errors like "[B2X] Cannot find execution class 'test.myClass' for translating business class 'test.myClass'" on BOM classes when changing the JDK version in Rule Studio or Rule Designer? 

CAUSE
The eXecution Object Model (XOM) classes are compiled in a previous JDK version and do not match the ones expected in the new version.
The same issue occurs when executing rules in Rule Execution Server a ruleset which XOM was compiled with a JDK different from the one running the server. See technote Cannot translate class "test.myClass" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652271].


ANSWER
Recompile the XOM classes with the new JDK version used by Rule Studio or Rule Designer.
