ABSTRACT
 The IBM Security QRadar Support Team and QRadar development discussed Windows Event Collection. After a presentation, attendees got an opportunity to ask the panel of experts questions. 

CONTENT
This Open Mic session was the third webcast provided by IBM Security QRadar Technical Support. Our goal is to provide insight on how QRadar works and to teach on-going sessions that help both users and administrators understand, maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with their QRadar Security Intelligence system.


During this open mic, we discussed Windows event collection, architecture, best practices, permissions, event collection configurations, WinCollect, WMI, common issues, and more. 

Throughout the event, attendees commented and asked questions in the IBM SmartCloud Meeting Web chat and then were able to dial in and speak with the panelists. This was an interactive, educational, lively session.

How to ask questions 
After our first open mic webcast, a number of users and administrators asked if they could send us questions in advance of the next open mic session. We have set aside a post in the QRadar Customer Forum for you to ask questions about Windows event collection that you want addressed in the open mic webcast.
