ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JIRA# THU-10620
   
       * Problem: A sample UCA is not launching a BPD instance
   correctly when both are solely encompassed in a toolkit.
   Although both are written correctly, the start message event in
   the BPD does not seem to receive the message from the UCA and no
   BPD instance is visible in the Inspector view of the Toolkit
   environment. The customer noticed this when they were trying to
   encapsulate everything within a toolkit and run all their tests
   within the toolkit environment.
   
   This issue was reproduced on my local install of WLE 7.2 on
   Windows 7 64-bit with DB2.
   
   The temporary "workaround" for this issue is to create a Process
   App and add the toolkit as a dependency. Kicking off the UCA
   will then start an instance of the BPD in the Process App's
   Inspector view. (it will never be seen in the Toolkit env's
   Inspector view)
   
   If this can't be easily fixed in the near future, at very least
   it should be documented in the Info Center or technote.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The temporary "workaround" for this issue is to create a Process
   App and add the toolkit as a dependency. Kicking off the UCA
   will then start an instance of the BPD in the Process App's
   Inspector view. (it will never be seen in the Toolkit env's
   Inspector view)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A sample UCA is not launching a BPD instance correctly
   when both are solely encompassed in a toolkit. Although both are
   written correctly, the start message event in the BPD does not
   seem to receive the message from the UCA and no BPD instance is
   visible in the Inspector view of the Toolkit environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Apply the workaround for this issue, which is to create a
   Process App and add
   the toolkit as a dependency. Kicking off the UCA will then start
   an instance of the BPD in the Process App's Inspector view (it
   will never be seen in the Toolkit env's Inspector view)
