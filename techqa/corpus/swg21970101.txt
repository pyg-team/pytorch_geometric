QUESTION
 There are CA NSM agents installed on the Tandem Server. How would you integrate these with the SNMP/MTTrapd Probe? 

ANSWER
Obtain the MIBs for the NSM agents from the vendor and use the MIB Manager to generate the required rules for the Probe.

Configure the CA NSM agents send their traps to Port 162 (or the listening port) on the local or remote host where the SNMP Probe is installed. The probe will listen for the traps and process them using the information in the SNMP.rules file.
