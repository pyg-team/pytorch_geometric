PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Get a library am_sun_16 error when starting a monitored WebLogic Server v2.1.3 on Windows.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=1]


CAUSE
This is caused due to the missing references to the 32-bit library in the PATH variable.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This problem occurs because of the incorrect PATH variable in the WebLogic startup script.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are the steps to resolve this problem: 


1. Navigate to the directory where your startup script is located. In my case, am using the default domain 'base_domain', so my startup script is under here:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=2]

2. Make a backup of your startup script. In my case, its startWebLogic.cmd, the default startup script.

3. Modify the startWebLogic.cmd script, and search for "DC for Weblogic support". This is where ITCAM makes changes to the script. In here, change the PATH variable to point to the 32-bit library like this.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968682&aid=3]
4. Save the file, and restart the WebLogic server using the startup script.

5. You should now be able to restart the server successfully without any errors. It will look something like this. Note the am_sun_16 library is now picked up successfully.

Note: This error was seen on Windows using WebLogic 12.1.3 configured with ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0.2. It may also occur on other WebLogic versions with other OS. Click here for a Linux/Unix technote.
