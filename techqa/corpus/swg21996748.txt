WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM WebSphere MQ supports Object Messages as part of the JMS specification, however ObjectMessage usage is discouraged. To mitigate this vulnerability, message types that do not contain this security flaw, such as JSON or XML, should be used. To ensure that messages come from recognized senders, a security mechanism, such as MQ's AMS (Advanced Message Security), can be used.
