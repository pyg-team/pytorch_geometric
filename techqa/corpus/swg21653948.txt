PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On Maximo systems running on WebSphere that have been integrated with LDAP directory services, users could be kicked out or timed out while actively working. 

SYMPTOM
Users could automatically be logged out or have the screens freeze while actively working on Maximo applications. This is not related to the Maximo idle timeout that is set in the maximo\applications\maximo\maximouiweb\webmodule\WEB-INF\web.ml file.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the systemout.log you can see warnings like : 

SECJ0371W: Validation of the LTPA token failed because the token expired with the following info: Token expiration Date: Mon Jun 18 08:45:00 PDT 2012, current Date: Mon Jun 18 09:37:18 PDT 2012.

This may be followed by :
SECJ0053E: Authorization failed for /UNAUTHENTICATED while invoking (Bean)MAXIMO#mboejb.jar#accesstokenprovider getAccessToken::3 Subject:
Principal: /UNAUTHENTICATED
Public Credential: com.ibm.ws.security.auth.WSCredentialImpl@6e896e89
is not granted any of the required roles: maximouser 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The default time out period for an LTPA token is 120 minutes after which the session is ended. This may need to be increased.

To change LTPA timeout value: 

1. Login to your WebSphere Integrated Solution Console. 
2. On the left pane, click Security > Global Security 
3. Click on LTPA on the right pane 
4. Look for the LTPA timeout value and increase it to a value ( minutes) that suits your users. ( eg: 360 or 480) 
5. Stop the Maximo JVM(s) , synchronize your nodes and restart the Maximo JVM(s).
