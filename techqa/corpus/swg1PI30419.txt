APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS Statistics provide complete statistics for URIMAP usage
   when CICS is acting as a server. Those statistics are missing
   when CICS is functioning as a client, for example when EXEC
   CICS INVOKE WEBSERVICE is used. PM24666 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM24666] was originally opened
   to document this issue but no code changes were made at that
   time. This APAR is now being opened to correct the deficiency.

 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: EXEC CICS WEB OPEN URIMAP() requests    *
   *                      do not increment URIMAP statistics.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   URIMAP statistics are only updated when DFHWBUR is called
   for LOCATE_URIMAP. This call is typically made in the case
   where CICS is acting as a server and has to search for a
   URIMAP using the URI information in the HTTP request.
   In the case of EXEC CICS WEB OPEN, the URIMAP name is
   specified on the call and there is no LOCATE_URIMAP call
   so no statistics are recorded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WEB OPEN processing has been updated so that URIMAP statistics
   are collected if a URIMAP is being used.
