PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Exit programs may prevent Operations Navigator or iSeries Navigator from starting. This document describes the errors and how to check for a registered exit program. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem: Message CWB0006 is issued when using Operations Navigator on Client Access Express with the latest service pack. The emulator works; however, Operations Navigator does not work. 

Note: A similar issue with iSeries Navigator with iSeries Access for Windows can also happen.

The cwbping returns:

msgcwbco1003
msgcwbco1006
msgcwbco1011
msgcwbco1008
msgcwbco1016

In the communications trace, the job that was failing was QZRCSRVS in subsystem QUSRWRK. The joblog for this job had message regarding a library PSCOMMON. To verify that an exit program is registered, on the operating system command line type the following:

WRKREGINF QIBM_QZRC_RMT

Press the Enter key. Type 8 for Exit Programs. The exit program there was a security type program for PentaSafe - AACLZRC in lib PSCOMMON.

Solution: Call PentaSafe for assistance in adjusting the software to allow Operations Navigator to connect.
