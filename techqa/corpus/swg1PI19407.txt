LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The syndicator status shows as pending while the syndication is
   still running
   
   The syndicator status shows as 'PENDING' while the syndication
   is still running. The status should be 'ACTIVE'.
   
   Recreate steps:
   
   1, Create a syndication pair
   2, Syndicate a library
   3, Create a content A and syndicate it
   4, Modify content A to refer a component B in other library
   which is not syndicated to subscriber and save
   5, After another run of syndicaiton, content A will show up in
   the failed item list
   6, Move component B to the library which is syndicated
   7, After another run of syndication, component B will be
   syndicated to the target library on subscriber
   
   But the update of content A is syndicated as well.
   
   The expected behaviour of this scenario is. The update content A
   should NOT be syndicated until user click update manually.
   
   Note: the problem was introduced by CF12.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis: 'FailedToSyndicate' was maintained inproperly. Since
   that flag was not scoped to an individual syndication pair, we
   are no longer using it
   Solution: Getting rid of 'FailedToSyndicate' flag
