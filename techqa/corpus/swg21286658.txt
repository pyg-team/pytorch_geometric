PROBLEM
Collecting data documents (formerly called MustGather documents) aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs) for IBM® Forms Webform Server - API. 

Collecting data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBM Support determine: 

 * If symptoms match known problems (rediscovery) 
 * If there is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved 
 * The root cause, which can accelerate the development of a code fix

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before contacting IBM Support, there are troubleshooting steps you can take that may help you resolve the problem with the IBM Forms Webform Server - API on AIX operating system. If after following these steps you are still experiencing the problem, you can open a problem management record (PMR) with IBM Support and supply the information outlined below. 

Troubleshooting steps 

1. Check the detailed system requirements for IBM Forms Server [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015581&wv=1] to make sure your system meets the requirements.


 * Is WebSphere® Application Server a 64-bit Install?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Which JVM?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * prefs.config 
 * 
 * must
 * 
 * javaPath 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * /etc/PureEdge/API 7.0/prefs/
 * 


2. Check the C Runtime AIX using the information in technote 1240759 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2357&uid=swg21240759] 
 * 
 * installing C/C++ compiler and runtime PTFs on AIX 
 * 
 * 
 * Latest updates for supported IBM C and C++ compilers


3. The LIBPATH Environment Variable must be set for the API to initialize properly. The variable should contain the following entries:  * /lib
 * 
 * /usr/lib
 * 
 * /usr/lib/PureEdge/xx/system
 * 
 * <
 * path to JVM>
 * /jre/bin/classic 
 * 
 * <
 * path to JVM>
 * /jre/bin 
 * 
 * <
 * path to directory containing the Netscape Security Libraries
 * >

 * API installation guide
 * 



Collecting and providing diagnostic data 

1. Gather general information 
 * 

 *  A complete description of the problem, including how the error is manifesting itself Operating system version, release, and maintenance level IBM Forms Server and API version WebSphere Application Server version, release, and maintenance level Related product version and release levels Are WebSphere Application Server and IBM Forms Webform Server components installed on the same machine? If not, describe the environment Your contact information - phone number and e-mail address Log files (see Step 3) 


2. Gather debug information 
 * 

 * 
 * /etc 
 * 
 * wpf.pel
 * 

 * touch /etc/wpf.pel

 * 
 * debug.log
 * 

 * 


3. Gather log files 
 * 

 * The debug.log file generated by the wpf.pel
   from the current working directory

 * WebSphere Application Server (WAS) logs
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/logs
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/profiles/<profileName>/logs
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/profiles/<profileName>/logs/ffdc
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/profiles/<profileName>/logs/server1
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/profiles/<profileName>/logs/TranslatorServer

 * WebSphere Portal logs
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/logs
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/logs/ffdc
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/AppServer/logs/WebSphere_Portal
   <WebSphere Install Dir>/PortalServer/logs

 * Webform Server logs
   <Workplace Forms Install Dir>/LogServer 
   <Workplace Forms Install Dir>/LogServer/logs


4. Send the data you gathered to IBM Support 
 * 
 * send diagnostic information to IBM support
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support
 *
