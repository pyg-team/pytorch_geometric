APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Data items which follow an SQL END-EXEC several times with no
   reference are not treated as invalid syntax by COBOL
   precompiler.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 10 and 11 for z/OS users of          *
   *                 the DB2 precompiler with COBOL               *
   *                 applications.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DB2 precompiler with a COBOL            *
   *                      application does not get any syntax     *
   *                      error when an SQL END-EXEC is followed  *
   *                      by invalid data items without a period  *
   *                      specified after END-EXEC.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   No syntax error may be issued when invalid data items appear
   after an END-EXEC statement:
   
   Example:
   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
   .
   .
   01 IS-THIS-AN-ERROR PIC X.
   01 MYVAR2 PIC X(26).
   
   PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   
   PERFORM SQL-SELECT.
   GOBACK.
   
   SQL-SELECT SECTION.
   
   EXEC SQL
   SELECT CURRENT TIMESTAMP AS DUMMY INTO :MYVAR2
   FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1
   END-EXEC         <<-- Invalid data items follow
   IS-THIS-AN-ERROR      END-EXEC and there is no
   IS-THIS-AN-ERROR      period after END-EXEC
   IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
   IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
   display MYVAR2
   .
   SQL-SELECT-EXIT.
   EXIT.
   
   The above COBOL precompiler generated listing code will look
   like below but no syntax error message is displayed.
        PERFORM SQL-INITIAL UNTIL SQL-INIT-DONE
        CALL 'DSNHLI' USING SQL-PLIST1
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
           display MYVAR2
           .
   
   After the fix, the DB2 precompiler generates listing
   code with the END-CALL phrase, the DSNHPC precompiler
   return code will be changing from 04 to 00, and the
   IGYCRCTL COBOL compiler will issue error message
   IGYPS2072-S for the invalid data items.
        PERFORM SQL-INITIAL UNTIL SQL-INIT-DONE
        CALL 'DSNHLI' USING SQL-PLIST1
        END-CALL             <-- END-CALL phrase generated to
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR      separate SQL-PLIST and invalid
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR      data items.
           IS-THIS-AN-ERROR
   
           display MYVAR2
           .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DB2 precompiler code has been enhanced to generate the
   END-CALL phrase for DSNHLI, DSNHLI2, and DSNHLIR.
   DB2 does not need to be restarted after applying this fix.
