Title: IBM Failed login attempts in IBM i2 Analyze cause subsequent attempts to also fail - United States

Text:
analyze; ldap; authentication TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After a failed LDAP login attempt, subsequent login attempts
using a different account will fail with the same error
message. 

SYMPTOM
USER1 is not correctly configured, and is not a member of any
Analyze security groups. Login produces the following error:

Could not log in. Unknown error: Unable to provision, see the
following errors:

1) Error in custom provider,
com.i2group.apollo.common.exception.ValidationRuntimeException

User account for 'USER1' is not configured correctly. Contact
an Administrator'.

USER2 is correctly configured. Attempting to log in with this
account after USER1 has failed a login attempt results in
exactly the same error message (complete with identical
username).


CAUSE
This error is caused due to an LPTA token not being correctly removed when login fails. This issue has been logged as a defect under APAR PO05689.

ENVIRONMENT
i2 Analyze is configured to use LDAP user authentication.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Performing a cache refresh in the web browser by pressing Ctrl-F5 will enable successful login attempts again.
