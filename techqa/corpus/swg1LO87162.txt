APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some users may find that after upgrading the Verse iOS app from
   9.2.4 (or earlier) to the current App Store version, they may
   have to re-enter their user name and password.  For on-premise
   users, they may have to enter the server address, too.  Then the
   app will behave as if the account was being set up for the first
   time -- it will connect to the server and begin syncing the
   user's data from scratch, even though this had been done in the
   previous version of the app.
   
   This does not happen to all users.  It may be more common if
   there are no other IBM apps on the device, or if the user has
   installed Verse from the TestFlight beta program.  But it may
   also happen in other situations.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no workaround when this problem occurs.  The user must
   re-enter their credentials to set up the app again.
   
   A fix will be available in 9.2.5, but unfortunately, this will
   not affect upgrades from 9.2.4 (or earlier) to 9.2.5, so the
   problem may still occur after downloading the 9.2.5 app.  The
   fix will prevent the problem from occurring when upgrading from
   9.2.5 to a later version of the app.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Some users may find that after upgrading the Verse iOS app from
   9.2.4 (or earlier) to the current App Store version, they may
   have to re-enter their user name and password.  For on-premise
   users, they may have to enter the server address, too.  Then the
   app will behave as if the account was being set up for the first
   time -- it will connect to the server and begin syncing the
   user's data from scratch, even though this had been done in the
   previous version of the app.
   
   This does not happen to all users.  It may be more common if
   there are no other IBM apps on the device, or if the user has
   installed Verse from the TestFlight beta program.  But it may
   also happen in other situations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Some app-specific information may change when a new version is
   downloaded from the App Store.  Because this information was
   used to encode data on the device, when it changes, the data
   becomes inaccessible.  So we made the app more tolerant of these
   changes.  Please note that the original bug may still occur when
   upgrading from an older version to 9.2.5 or later, but will be
   fixed once 9.2.5 or later is installed on the device.  So the
   problem will no longer occur when upgrading from 9.2.5 to a
   later version.
