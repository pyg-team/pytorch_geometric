   a wrong value like '1,500000'. Here it display a "comma" (,) in
   status value.

   1. On any Linux or Unix system, run the following command to set
   the locale as Russian.
   
   
   export LC_ALL=ru_RU.utf8
   
   2. Restart the Sybase Agent.
   
   cd $CANDLEHOME/bin
   ./CandleAgent stop oy
   ./CandleAgent start oy
   
   3. Go to ITM TEP, check the Sybase Server->Servers->Server
   Summary Table View, and Server Status column.
   It displays as "1,500000"
