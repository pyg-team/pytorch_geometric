QUESTION
 Is ITM DB2 agent V7.1 supported to run on AIX running on Power8 systems? 

CAUSE
When moving AIX LPAR on a new hardware, most often it is requested to maintain unchanged the applications running on the LPAR to avoid additional effort.
But it in this case it is important to know if the application version running on current hardware is expected to work with no major issues on the new processors.


ANSWER
Development team completed certification activity for IBM DB2 agent running on AIX 7.1 and Power 8 on March 2015. 

The certified agent version is 7.1 IF02 (7.1.0-TIV-ITM_DB2-IF0002). 

Even if no issues are expected with the previous maintenance level (IF01), we anyway recommend to install Interim Fix 2 in order to be fully compliant with the test performed by the certifiers.
