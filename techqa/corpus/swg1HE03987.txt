   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   Failures occur when exporting Italic/Bold Mirrored
   Discretized fonts in all formats.
   Technical explanation of the defect:
   - Drafting simulates mirroring by changing viewpoint matrix.
   - Print simulated mirroring by changing slant angle (slant =
   180, means horizontal mirroring)
   - In CATPrintGenerator::DrvDrawText, slant angle is reset to
   ???0??? if font style is italic (for unknown reasons).
   Technical explanation of the correction:
   The slant angle is not reset to 0 even if font style is
   italic.
   Possible by-pass and/or correction limitation:
   None
