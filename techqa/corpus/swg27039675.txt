ABSTRACT
 If you are using the Google Chrome browser or Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer versions 8 or 9 with the Google Chrome Frame plug-in, the help topics are not displayed when you click the Help button for IBM Content Navigator. 

CONTENT
The IBM Content Navigator help framework opens and the navigation pane is displayed correctly, but clicking the navigation pane does not open the help topics. 


The workaround is to invoke the help directly from the browser address bar, or by copying and pasting the help URL into a different browser.
