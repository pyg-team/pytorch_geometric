QUESTION
 I am unable to cut, copy or paste pages of a document in the IBM Content Navigator applet viewer for Content Manager. 

ANSWER
The cut, copy or paste actions on a page are collectively referred to as page manipulation. This feature is not available in IBM Content Navigator applet viewer for Content Manager. As a result, it is seen that even in Edit mode, the cut, copy and paste buttons are disabled (grayed out) when a document page is in focus. 

Note: The Edit mode (top toolbar, leftmost button) button must be clicked to enable Edit mode on a document before making any modifications to it.
