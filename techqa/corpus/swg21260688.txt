Text:
hp11i3cert TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you install IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 on a machine that runs the HP-UX 11i v3 operating system, you might encounter the following error message:

Failed : Your operating system failed the prerequisites check. 
A supported operating system was not detected. Support for your operating system might have been added after the release of the product. You can continue with the installation, but the installation might not succeed.


If you install the product silently, you might encounter the following error message:

Process, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.
MaintenancePrereqCheckAction, wrn, 
To disable operating system prerequisite checking, set option 
disableOSPrereqChecking to true, or refer to the "Operating 
System Prerequisite Checking" section in the sample response 
file.

This document explains how to address the issue without setting the disableOSPrereqChecking option value to true. 

CAUSE
HP-UX 11i v3 is a newly supported operating system for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1. The maintenance.xml file might not list HP-UX 11i v3 as a supported operating system.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As a workaround for this problem, complete the steps in the following procedure. 



Note: The prerequisite warning message might still display. The installation process for WebSphere Application Server uses a conservative method of prerequisite checking. It checks for certain levels of operating systems and does not recognize operating system levels that exceed the documented requirements. Even if your operating system level exceeds the minimum requirements, the WebSphere Application Server installer might display the prerequisite warning. The prerequisite warning message might display even if you use the instructions in this document to update the product files. WebSphere Application Server officially supports more recent operating system fix pack levels than the levels that are listed on the detailed system requirements pages.




You can use these steps to update WebSphere Application Server, Application Client for WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server, or the Web server plug-in. 

 1. Remove the temporary log directories that might have been created by previous installations. 
    
    
    If you do not remove the log files, you might encounter messages from previous installations. Remove the following directories:  * user_home/waslogs
       
       
     * user_home/plglogs 
       
       
     * user_home/cltlogs 
       
       
     * user_home/ihslogs 
       
       
    
    
 2. If you are installing WebSphere Application Server from a CD or DVD, copy the image to a temporary directory.
    
    
 3. Make a backup copy of the maintenance.xml file.
    
    
    You can find the existing maintenance.xml files in the following locations on your system:  * WebSphere Application Server: temp_directory/WAS/was.primary.pak/
       
       
     * Application Client for WebSphere Application Server: temp_directory/AppClient/client.primary.pak/
       
       
     * IBM HTTP Server: temp_directory/IHS/ihs.primary.pak/
       
       
     * Web server plug-in: temp_directory/Plugin/plg.primary.pak/
       
       
    
    
 4. Copy the appropriate maintenance.xml file from the following table and overwrite the original file in the temporary directory.
    
    
    Note: The Product Edition column within the following table refers to the product edition for your WebSphere Application Server-related product and not the system processor type.

 5. Start the installation interface or the silent installation process.
