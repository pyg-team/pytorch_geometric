Title: IBM Error Number: 2030 when trying to view output in Amos 7 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running Amos 7. After running by estimates, I go to open my Text Output, when I receive the following error message:

Error Number: 2030
Source: ActiveBar2 Class (AppViewer3)
Description: Combobox is read only, the text property can only be set if the value is contained in the list.
[Extendend Info: 7]
Call stack: frmMain WB1_DocumentComplete

I click the OK button and my results will display, but I do not get a navigation menu or tool buttons. How can I resolve this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Manually registering the actbar2.ocx file will resolve the problem. However, the actbar2.ocx file may reside in more than one directory. You may need to do a file search to verify where the file exists. Then follow these steps:

1. Click on START->RUN and type cmd. This will open a command window.

2. At the prompt, change the directory to where the activebar2.ocx file was found. To do this, type 

cd C:\[enter the file path], and press the Enter key.

3. At the prompt, type:

regsvr32 actbar2.ocx

You will get a 'succeed' message box. 

4. Exit from the command window and re-run your Amos file.
