QUESTION
 How do you install IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) 8.5, Rational Performance Tester Agent 8.5, and Rational License Key Administrator (LKAD) 8.1.3 on Microsoft Windows 64-bit? 

ANSWER
On 64-bit machines, running the launchpad from the RPT Setup download will result in an error when installing the 32 bit LKAD 8.1.3 which is listed under "Install Optional Products" on the launchpad menu. This is because launchpad will launch and install the 64-bit Installation Manger which cannot be used to install LKAD 8.1.3.
To avoid this issue. use a 32-bit version of Installation Manager to install the LKAD, RPT 8.5, and RPT Agent 8.5.

The following steps assume that no other Rational software is on the machine and that the LKAD, RPT, and RPT Agent are being installed for the first time as opposed to performing an upgrade from a previous release.

In addition, the following steps will include basic installation verification steps.

1. Download the repositories for LKAD, RPT, and RPT Agent:

LKAD 8.1.3 


 * IBM Rational License Key Administrator V8.1.3 for Windows Multilingual (CI90LML)



RPT 8.5: 
 * IBM Rational Performance Tester V8.5 Setup Evaluation Multiplatform Multilingual (CINW9ML) or
   IBM Rational Performance Tester V8.5 Setup Multiplatform Multilingual (CINW6ML)

 * IBM Rational Performance Tester V8.5 Core Part 1 Evaluation Multiplatform Multilingual (CINX0ML) or
   IBM Rational Performance Tester V8.5 Core Part 1 Multiplatform Multilingual (CINW7ML)



RPT 8.5 Agent: 
 * IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent Controller V8.5 Part 1 Evaluation Multiplatform Multilingual (CINX1ML) or
   IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent Controller V8.5 Part 1 Multiplatform Multilingual (CINW8ML) 


2. unzip the files to a temporary directory, e.g. C:\temp2 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *

3. Install LKAD 8.1.3 

Run launchpad from this LKAD_SETUP\disk1 directory as administrator 
Click on Install or Update IBM Rational License Key Administrator 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=1] 


This will install Installation Manager 1.5.2 first, then LKAD 8.1.3. 

After Installation Manage is installed click on Restart Installation Manager, then click on Install to install the LKAD 8.1.3 
After installation of the LKAD 8.1.3, both the Installation Manager and launchpad applications can be closed 


4. Install RPT 8.5 workbench 

Run launchpad from the RPT_SETUP directory as administrator 
Click on Install IBM Rational Performance Tester 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=2] 


This will first update Installation Manager from 1.5.2 to 1.6.3.1 which is required to install RPT 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=3] 


If using PVU licensing then check IBM Rational Test Workbench Process Value Unit (PVU) support otherwise leave it unchecked. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=4] 


After installing, click Finish to exit Installation Manager. The launchpad application can be closed at this time. 


5. Install the RPT Agent 

Run launchpad from the RPTAGENT_SETUP\disk1 directory as Administrator 
Click on Install IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=5] 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=6] 


Enter the hostname of the RPT workbench machine. Any of the following forms can be used 
 * localhost 
 * the short hostname 
 * the fully qualified hostname 
 * the IP address of the local machine


For this example we'll use "localhost". Although the install will proceed if this field is left blank, the RPT agent still needs to be configured to point to a RPT workbench machine. This can be done after installation by modifying the majordomo.config file of the agent. However, it's easier to enter the hostname now than it is to configure it after installation.

At this prompt choose the default option IBM Rational Performance Tester - for use with the Virtual Tester Pack floating license in IBM Rational Performance Tester if you plan to use floating licenses or the product activation kit. 

Choose the second option IBM Rational Performance Test Server - for use with IBM Rational Test Workbench if using PVU licensing. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=8] 


After installation of the RPT Agent the launchpad application can be closed 

Installation of the RPT Agent can be verified by checking services to confirm the majordomo service is running

 1. Start IBM Installation Manager and select Manage Licenses 
 2. Select the IBM Rational Product, then choose the Import product activation kit option 
 3. Browse to the jar file that you unzipped in step 2 and click Next, then Finish 
 4. The activation kit will be installed. To verify the license installation, you can select Manage Licenses in IBM Installation Manager or view it through Help -> License status in the "Rational Product". 
 5. The permanent license is now installed 
 6. Configure floating license support



If using floating license support instead of an activation kit, then perform the following steps 
 1.  Start IBM Installation Manager and select Manage Licenses 
 2.  Select the IBM Rational Product, then choose the Configure Floating license support option 
 3.  Press Next 
 4.  Click I accept the terms in the license agreement then press Next 
 5.  Click on the green + sign to add a server 
 6.  Enter the server name, the port, then Test Connection 
 7.  Confirm that the server is available and there are one or more license keys available for IBM RPT [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&amp;aid=10] 
 8.  Click OK then Finish 
 9.  Installation Manager can be closed at this time 
 10. Start the License Key Administrator 
 11. Choose Point to a Rational License Server to get my licenses 
 12. Enter the name of the license server in the Server Name prompt and choose Finish



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=11] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=11] 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=12] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=12] 


The LKAD application can be closed at this time 

8. Verify installation 

Start Rational Performance Tester - Full Eclipse 
Use the default workspace. 

RPT should start with no error messages about licenses. 

Click on the Agent Status icon on the toolbar directly under the Search command 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=13] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654409&aid=13] 


The RPT Agent should have a status of "Ready". If it doesn't, then check the majordomo.config file, the default location is "C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\Majordomo".
