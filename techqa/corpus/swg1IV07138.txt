   To minimize event loss, which can occur if clients fail back to
   a primary ObjectServer before resynchronization is completed,
   client failback behavior must be controlled by a failover pair
   of ObjectServers instead of the clients themselves. The
   configuration for controlled failback is based around the
   aggregation layer in the multitiered architecture.
   To configure controlled failback for clients that connect to the
   failover pair, perform the following steps for the client types:
   
       * Probes: If probes are connecting to the aggregation
   failover pair, disable failback in the probes by configuring
   them to connect to the aggregation (virtual) ObjectServer pair
   and by disabling polling. In the probe properties file:
             o Set Server to AGG_V.
             o Set ServerBackup to "".
             o Set PollServer to 0.
   
   The present multitier configuration is to use the probes Server
   and ServerBackup [PollServer & NetworkTimeout] properties at the
   Collection layer.
   Controlled synchronisation is managed within the Netcool/OMNIbus
   v7.3 product and pre-v7.2 is covered on the GAT site.
   The use of Virtual Object Servers at this [Collection] level
   isn't recommended as failover/failback is not managed.
   
   The use of Server, ServerBackup, PollServer & NetworkTimeout is
   not documented adequately in the current documentation set and
   this should also be addressed.
   e.g.
   PollServer > NetworkTimeout

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users accessing the "Configuring controlled failback of      *
   * clients" topic in the documentation Info Center.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The documentation talks about connecting probes to the       *
   * Aggregation layer and using a VOS.                           *
   * This is incorrect. The probes should only connect to the     *
   * collection layer and should use the standard                 *
   * failover/failback probe property settings.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The customer should refer to the updated information center  *
   * re the "Configuring controlled failback of clients" topic.   *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuring controlled failback of clients" topic has been
   updated with the following information:
   
   Probes connecting to the collection failover pair, must use the
   standard failover and failback property settings. In the probe
   properties file:
   
   Set Server to NCOMS_P.
   Set ServerBackup to NCOMS_B.
   Set NetworkTimeout to 15.
   Set PollServer to 60.
