APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running DVS test with 1800 scenarios, generating a test
   report with execution details can consume a lot of memory.
   
   All the execution traces for all the scenarios are retrieved at
   once by using the IlrSSPClient.getExecutionTraces method.
   
   It is the most efficient method to retrieve execution traces
   when there is not a lot of execution traces because it does
   only one transaction commit but it produces an out of memory
   when you have too many execution traces.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This can be set to a positive integer corresponding to the
   number of execution traces we want to retrieve from the Rule
   Execution Server and
   have in memory in Decision Center at a time.
   This preference setting can be set using a config param in
   Decision Center Entreprise Console .
   The value of this parameter needs to be adjusted depending on
   the number of scenarios and on a the memory available on both
   the Rule Execution Server and Decision Center.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
