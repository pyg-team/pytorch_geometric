Title: IBM MClaims Autofield not recognizing claim form with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

autofield ub04 hcfa cms 1500 recognition TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running forms through the MClaims application, the Autofield action fails to recognize the form. 

CAUSE
The form does not meet the minimum specifications required by the Autofield action.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To identify why recognition failed, do the following: 

 1. Locate the following images:  * The original scanned in image, located within the batch folder. 
     * The master image, located in the \Datacap\MClaims\dco_(workflow)\Verify folder. Do not use the fingerprint copy located in the fingerprint folder.
    
    
 2. Print both copies, being sure to print them actual size, and do not resize them to fit the page. 
 3. Put them together and hold them up to the light. Check for the following:  * Vertical skewing - Autofield can handle up to about a 6mm vertical variance up or down from the corresponding line from the master image. Beyond that, it will fail. 
     * Horizontal skewing - If horizontal skewing puts text outside of the input box on the form, then recognition will fail. 
     * If a required field is missing. The following fields are required.  * Professional Claims (CMS 1500) 
        * 1aInsrID 
        * 2PatName7I 
        * 21_Diag1 
        * 24aDtFr1 (1st Date of Service start)
       
       
     * Institutional Claims (UB04/HCFA)  * 1fcynmad 
        * 5fedtxnm 
        * 42arevcd 
        * 47attchg
       
       
    
    
 4. Correct the cause of the problem, as determined in step 3. Possible causes might include:  * Providers sending in forms made from photocopies, rather than originals made by a professional printer. Copied forms can be improperly centered on the page, stretched, skewed, or the ink in red forms may actually contain some black in it which gets picked up in the scanned image. 
     * The scanner is dirty or misaligned. Feed rollers may cause slippage so that the form isn't correctly positioned in the scanner. 
     * Scanner image enhancement options may be turned on. Scanner image enhancement should be completely turned off with the exception of red dropout. The ImageFix action in Taskmaster is configured to optimize MClaims forms. 
     * Providers may have sent in incomplete forms.
