APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting the connection from a 'WebSphere MQ Client for HP
   Integrity NonStop Server Version 8.0.0.1' with TMF Gateway
   to MQ V8 on z/OS, the following message appears in the MQ Client
   log:
   
   AMQ5378: Participation in TMF transactions is not supported by
   queue manager 'CSQ1'
   
   EXPLANATION:
   TMF/Gateway has detected WebSphere MQ for z/OS queue manager
   'CSQ1' does not support participation in TMF transactions.
   
   ACTION:
   The version of z/OS queue manager that you are connecting to
   does not support the TMF Gateway, please upgrade to a supported
   release.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 8 *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a HP Non-Stop TMF client connects  *
   *                      to V8 MQ for z/OS, it fails to          *
   *                      establish an XA transaction. The MQ     *
   *                      client generates error message AMQ5378  *
   *                      in the client error log.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The MQ client HP Non-Stop TMF application connects to a MQ for
   z/OS queue manager and requests to establish a transactional
   session sending a flow of XA_OPEN and XA_INFO messages. The
   XA_INFO message is a string with key/value pairs. The queue
   manager fails to properly parse the string and identify the key
   names responding to the client as it does not support HP
   Non-Stop TMF. The parsing failure is related to the CCSID that
   queue manager is running. In this case the queue manager was
   running with CCSID 278 where the '@' has code-point xEC instead
   of x7C expected by the queue manager.
   
   Queue managers running with any of the following CCSIDs can be
   affected by this problem:
   273, 277, 278, 280, 284, 290, 297, 803, 871, 935, 1026, 1122,
   1141, 1142, 1143, 1144, 1145, 1147, 1149, 1157, 1388, 1390,
   4899, 5026.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The queue manager converts the XA_INFO string from the CCSID of
   the queue manager to a system CCSID used by the compiler. This
   fixes the parsing of the XA_INFO string and the client can
   initiate a TMF transaction with the queue manager.
