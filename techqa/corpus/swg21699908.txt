Title: IBM TDWC prompts for ID and password every time an engine connection is made - United States

Text:
sso TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Although you have already loggged on to Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC), you are prompted for User Credentials each time you attempt to make an engine connection. 

CAUSE
Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) and TDWC are installed in separated WebSphere Application Server (WAS) instances or on different workstations.
For TWS v9.1 and TDWC v9.1 and above, by default installation even on the same workstation, they are different WAS instances.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Share the engine connection credentials:


TDWC > Manage Engines > Engine Connection Properties > Connection Credentials, at the right side check "Share credentials". 

NOTE: This will also share the engine connection user's rights with any other users. This means that users who have restricted rights defined in the TWS Security file will not work as expected. 

OR  * Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) between TDWC and TWS: 


Go to the IBM Knowledge Center and refer to the Administration Guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGSPN_9.2.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itws.doc_9.2/distr/src_ad/awsadmst_welcome.html?lang=en] > Configuring the Dynamic Workload Console > Configuring Dynamic Workload Console to use Single Sign-On 

NOTE: Not only LDAP is supported, but also other WAS repositories are supported as long as they (in TDWC and TWS) use the same physical repository (LDAP server, PAM server, localOS) to authenticate. RELATED INFORMATION
