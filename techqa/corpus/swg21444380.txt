Title: IBM Web Interface of Proventia Network Mail Security / Lotus Protector for Mail Security Appliance Cannot Be Accessed - United States

Text:
TLS 1.0; web interface doesn't load; LPMS; Proventia; PNMS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Although the system listens on port 443, and establishing a telnet connection on port 443 to the appliance works, it is not possible to load the web interface.

SYMPTOM
Error messages: 
IE = Internet Explorer cannot display the web page
Firefox = The connection to xx.xx.xx.xx was interrupted while the page was loading.


CAUSE
Apache requires TLS 1.0 encryption


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two possible solutions: 


1. Enable TLS 1.0 within the web browser's configuration (Recommended solution)


 * Firefox: Tools --> Options --> Advanced --> Encryption --> Protocols --> enable 'Use TLS 1.0' 
 * Internet Explorer: Tools --> Internet Options --> Advanced --> Settings --> (Security) --> Use TLS 1.0


2. If it is not possible to enable TLS 1.0, you may also change the apache configuration so that SSL 3.0 instead of TLS 1.0 is used: 
 * SSH to the appliance (log in as 'root') 
 * Open /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/mailsec_vhosts.conf 
 * For the virtual host node that you want change, go to the line 'SSLProtocol all' and add '-TLSv1' 
 * You should see 'SSLProtocol all -TLSv1' 
 * Save the changes 
 * Reload apache (service apache2 reload)
