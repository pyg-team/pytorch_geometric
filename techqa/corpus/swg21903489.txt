QUESTION
 Which roles must a user have to integrate APMUI console in DASH? 

CAUSE
The DASH admin user may be defined on a different user repository from the APMUI user registry. For APMUI console integration to succeed, the DASH admin user must be defined in a common user repository for both APMUI and DASH servers. 

ANSWER
Below steps can be used to give administrative roles to a user from the APMUI user registry, and then log into DASH as this user to perform the console integration steps. 

1) Define user repository of APMUI in DASH. 
2) Identify a user from APMUI user repository to be granted admin role in DASH (the example below uses apmadmin user)
3) Follow these steps to assign admin roles to the user:

3.1 Log into DASH as a user with administrator privileges, select Console Settings->User Roles option.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=1]

3.2 On the User Roles page, type the ID of APMUI user (for example, apmadmin) and then click the "Search" button. Click the link for the user in returned search results.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=2]


3.3 Select the "administrator" and "iscadmins" roles and then click "Save".

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903489&aid=3]

4) Use this administrative user to perform console integration steps.
