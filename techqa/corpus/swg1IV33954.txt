ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  View Related Records Functionality
   
   
   When using the View Related Records functionality in the PR
   
   Application, irrelevant POs show up.
   Consider the case where PO 1016 (site DENVER) and PO 1256 (site
   BEDFORD) are created from PR 1052 (site DENVER).
    In the view related records window (of PR application), PO 1016
   shows
   up multiple times (an entry for every site a PO with this number
   is
   created in) even if only PO 1016 for DENVER is really related to
   the PR
   In the case that I sent you, yes, we have changed the default
   insert
   site at one point so that we could create POs with different
   sites.
   However, we have replicated this process even without touching
   the
   default insert sites.
   Steps are as follows (I am re-creating it right now and will be
   past
   screenshots below):
   1)      Create a PR with two line items (I will be working with
   site
   BEDFORD).
   2)      I then go to the PO application and create 2 POs (one
   for ea
   line item of the PR) ? I will choose a PO number that already
   exists
   another site (because this is the fundamental criteria for this
   issu
   occur)
   POs for site DENVER (another Site)
   PO 1111 (BEDFORD) ? Chose PO number corresponding to one that
   alread
   exists for DENVER
   PO 1113 (auto-numbered)
   
   3)      View related records of PR ? 1111 shows up twice, for
   both
   sites. Only the one of BEDFORD is related to my PR in reality.
   To replicate this issue, 2 things are crucial: The PO number is
   alre
   used for another site and this already existing PO has at least
   one
   item. Otherwise, the issue will not be replicated.
