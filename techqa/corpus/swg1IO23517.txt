APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It seems the SetFingerprintSearchArea action only set at max to
   .29.  If you go into the settings of the "Identify Pages", you
   can enter any values that you want.  However, if you enter a
   value that is >.29, it always default back to .29.  If you set
   any value <=.29, the SetFingerprintSearchArea is updated to
   reflect the value that is <=.29.
