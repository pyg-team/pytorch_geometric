ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   Rhapsody 8.1.5 64-bit
   Windows 7
   
   Description:
   
   Customer has been loading table views in Rhapsody 8.1.3 without
   issues. They have migrated to 8.1.5, and have noticed the same
   tables take much much longer to load.
   
   Reproduction:
   
   Please unzip the attached project.
   In the FuncArch folder (under the Tables folder) are two SYSC
   prefixed models.
   One is an 8.1.5 model, the other is 8.1.3 (suffixed with 813).
   The rest of the content in the Tables folder is referenced into
   the models. Some references will be missing, but you can ignore.
   
   
   
   Open Rhapsody 8.1.3, and open the "SYSC_AAA_Table813" model
   Once in the model, expand the MDK_References_Pkg package and
   then the UtilityPkg_FNCM package.
   Under that you will see several Table Views, double click the
   SYSCView.
   Notice this takes about 1 second to load.
   
   Open Rhapsody 8.1.5, and open the "SYSC_AAA_Table" model
   In the model, navigate to the same Table View
   (MDK_References_Pkg/UtilityPkg_FNCM/Table Views/SYCSView)
   Notice this takes a much longer time to load. On my own tests,
   Rhapsody sometimes crashes.
   
   Additional Information:
   
   - The bigger the table, the longer it takes to load in Rhapsody
   8.1.5
   - I tried the model in Rhapsody 8.2, and saw the same lag. 8.2
   also crashed on me once loading the table (MFC Application
   Error)

   Hi @Shy.Matza@il.ibm.com,
   
   The customer would like a testfix for 8.1.5. Their build number
   is 9738229 64bit iFix2
   
   Thanks!

   @aratzloff@us.ibm.com Hi Alex, we believe we have a fix for
   that. The fix will be available with 8.2iFix003, which should be
   available by end of this week.
   If required, we can also suggest a testfix on top of 815 steam.
   In that case please provide the 815 exact version (32/64 bit)
   and build number on which the testfix is required.
