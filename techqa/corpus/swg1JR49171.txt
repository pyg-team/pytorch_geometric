   snapshot, When doing in-flight instance migration, the new

   inserted.

   If a variable is not set as searchable in the source snapshot,
   but it is set as searchable in the target snapshot because
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;Available in search &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189; is selected in Process Design
   the
   Business Data Search section of the Variables tab), the search
   alias name that is given to the variable when it was switched
   to searchable type is not updated when the instance is
   migrated.
   As a result, the business data alias is not available for you
   to view or use when you are in IBM Process Portal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V7.5.1.1 that introduces a
   configuration property that, when set, always saves the
   searchable variables.
   
   Complete the following steps:
   
   1.If the instance was already migrated, migrate the instance
   back to its original snapshot.
   2.Stop Process Server or the Process Center server.
   3.Install this fix according to its read me instructions.
   4.Enable the configuration property by adding the following
   entry to the 100Custom.xml configuration file:
   <server>
    <instance-migration merge= &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;mergeChildren &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;>
     <always-save-searchable-variables
   merge= &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;replace &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;>true</always-save-searchable-varia
    </instance-migration>
   </server>
   
   By default the value is false.
   5.Start Process Server or the Process Center server.
   6.Check that the enabled property is listed in
   TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml file.
   7.Migrate the instance.
   8.Repeat this procedure for each Process Center and Process
   Server installation.
