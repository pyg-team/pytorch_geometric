Title: IBM Executing the steps in "IBM i2 Analyze: Configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)" documentation does not explain in detail how to install an SSL certificate on Linux - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When working on Linux without a GUI--that is, command-line/shell access only--you cannot install an SSL certificate because the recommended tool, ikeyman, only works in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Specifically, the instructions in "IBM i2 Analyze: Configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)" simply say "For more information on the command line interface, see Key Management Utility command-line interface (gskcmd) syntax" and give no examples. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, modify the following commands, which are aligned to the aforementioned documentation, to suit your environment. 

"2. Create a keystore" 
cd /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/
/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/gskcapicmd -keydb -create -db /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/i2_key.kdb -pw YourPassword -stash 

 

3. Create a certificate
/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/gskcapicmd -cert -create -db /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/i2_key.kdb -stashed -dn "CN=analyzelinux.ibm.com,OU=mynetwork,O=mycompany,C=mycountry" -expire 7300 -label "MySelfSignedCert" -default_cert yes

4. Extract the i2 Certificate
/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/gskcapicmd -cert -extract -db /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/i2_key.kdb -stashed -label "MySelfSignedCert" -format ascii -target myselfsignedcert.der
cat myselfsignedcert.der 


Copy and paste the resulting text contents into a new text file in a Windows client, using the .der extension, then right-click the resulting file and select Install. (Note: You may need to temporarily show file extensions in Windows).
