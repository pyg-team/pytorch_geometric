 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The AuroraDBDelete.sql script is failing with the following error:

PLS-00201: identifier 'CTX_DDL" must be declared 

SYMPTOM
Any tool that utilizes the AuroraDBDelete.sql script is failing with the following oracle error: 

declare 
* 
ERROR at line 1: 
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7: 
PLS-00201: identifier 'CTX_DDL' must be declared 
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7: 
PL/SQL: Statement ignored 
ORA-06512: at line 270 
CAUSE
The Oracle IDs running the commands do NOT have the proper grants.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, a DBA should grant EXECUTE on CTXSYS.CTX_DDL. The following is the syntax to provide the grant: 

GRANT EXECUTE ON CTXSYS.CTX_DDL TO <username>; For example: GRANT EXECUTE ON CTXSYS.CTX_DDL TO OPENPAGES; GRANT EXECUTE ON CTXSYS.CTX_DDL TO OPWORKFLOW;

Once the DBA has provided the proper grant, the OpenPages IT administrator should try running the AuroraDBDelete.sql script again.
