APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  EventFlyover English text garbled with Traditional Chinese
   locale
   1-Install and configure a TEP machine for Traditional Chinese
   2-Ensure some events have fired
   3-Observe the EventFlyover text for the events is unreadable
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use zh_TW Chinese (Traditional) locale
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  English text in event flyover popups is unreadable when using
   Tivoli Enterprise Portal with the Traditional Chinese locale.
   
   On workstations configured to use the Traditional Chinese
   (zh_TW) locale, English and other western text in event flyover
   popups is unreadable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The underlying cause of this problem is that the Monospaced size
   14 font the portal uses to display event text does not work
   correctly for the Traditional Chinese locale. The problem can be
   corrected by changing the font family and/or size. Our
   experimentation suggests the DialogInput size 14 font provides
   optimal results for both western and Chinese text.
   
   To provide maximum flexibility, the portal logic was changed to
   allow the event flyover font to be externally specified via a
   runtime argument. The argument value is a comma-separated 3 part
   string of the form: name,style,size where:
   name is the logical or physical font name,
   style is the font style - "PLAIN", "BOLD", "ITALIC",
   "BOLDITALIC" (case-insensitive),
   size is the font point size
   
   The Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services application can
   be used to configure the setting. To set the suggested value:
   
   For desktop clients: Select Advanced | Edit Variables... from
   the context menu, double-click the "tep.event.flyover.font"
   symbol and enter "DialogInput,PLAIN,14" in the input field and
   select the "In use" checkbox.
   
   For browser clients: Perform the same steps as for the desktop
   clients or select Advanced | Edit ENV File... and insert the
   following line:
     document.writeln( '<PARAM NAME="tep.event.flyover.font"
     VALUE="DialogInput,PLAIN,14">' );
   before the following line:
     <!--END OF PARAMS-->
   
   For Java webstart clients: On the portal server, edit the
   $CANDLEHOME\Config\tep.jnlpt file and insert the following line:
     <property name="tep.event.flyover.font"
     value="DialogInput,PLAIN,14"/>
   before the following line:
     <!--$COOKIES$-->
   and recconfigure the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server. To avoid
   the reconfigure step, the same change can be applied to both the
   $CANDLEHOME\CNB\tep.jnlp and $CANDLEHOME\Config\tep.jnlpt files.
   Adjust the file locations as needed for Linux or UNIX portal
   servers. In either case, use the Internet Explorer "Internet
   Options" dialog to delete the browser temporary files to ensure
   the modified tep.jnlp file is reloaded.
