APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Portal 7.0.x, if the Portal admin is not the same as the
   WAS admin, attempting to create a virtual portal from the
   Virtual Portal Manager portlet results in exception:
   
   EJPAH2012E: Can not find xmlaccess script
   WebSphere:assetname=VirtualPortal.zip:InitVirtualPortal.xml.
   
     The virtual portal is created. However, when users access this
   virtual portal, the page just displays:
   
   Loading ...
   This page does not support content.
   
    If the Portal administrator attempts to re-initialize the
   virtual portal from the Virtual Portal Manager portlet, the same
   exception (EJPAH2012E) is thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Log in to the IBM&#65449; WebSphere&#65449; ICS admin console as the WAS
   administrative user and give the Portal admin user "Monitor"
   role, which is the minimum requirement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PM39581 is part of Cumulative Fix CF006 for Portal 7.0.0.1, but
   unfortunately the WAR is not redeployed in CF06, CF07, or CF08.
   The WAR is properly redeployed in CF09.
   
   Therefore, in CF06, CF07, or CF08 to take advantage of this fix,
   customers should manually redeploy the WAR by copying
   PortalServer/ap/wp.ap.virtualportal/installableApps/ManageVirtua
   lPortals.war to
   PortalServer/installableApps/ManageVirtualPortals.war and then
   running the ConfigEngine.sh/bat
   deploy-portlet-upgrade-wp.ap.virtualportal
