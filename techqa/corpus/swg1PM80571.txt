ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Information comes from previous PMR (62410,999,649):?Problem
   description?It appears the issue is when using Cognos for MS
   Office the images are displayed in bitmap ( .bmp ) format and
   produce a lower quality /blurry version of the image. Whereas
   the PDF export are using vector graphics so they are of better
   quality.??Client test case:?Using with the Office Plugin.?Open
   Microsoft Powerpoint 2010?Click on the IBM Cognos tab in the
   ribbon.?Launce the IBM Cognos plugin.?Login to server.?Navigate
   to report.?Select the report and select import content.?Rather
   than run the report live, we tend to use the Most Recent Version
   option.?Import a chart.?At this point the chart appears, not as
   ?crisp? as it is in Cognos, but when printing the document the
   chart is almost unreadable.??Here are the steps when we try just
   using the image directly.?Sign into Cognos Connection. Navigate
   to report. Open saved HTML version of report.?Right click chart
   -> select Download Chart option.?Save the image locally
   (defaults to a .png file as attached)?Open Powerpoint or word
   and import the image.?Again, the chart appears but it is not
   ?crisp? as it is in Cognos.
