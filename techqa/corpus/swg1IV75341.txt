APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DASH has no time out for attempts to connect console
   integrations where the target is itself hung.  This results in
   hang behavior when loggin into DASH and then eventual browser
   timeouts.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Kill the target application that the DASH console integration
   points to (e.g. WebGUI, Impact, APMU, etc) , and then retry the
   DASH login.
