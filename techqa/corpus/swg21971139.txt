QUESTION
 SOCKET : Is it possible to send gateway events to the probe? 

ANSWER
 

It is possible to send events from an object server using the SOCKET Gateway to another object server using the SOCKET Probe. 

Note: It is recommended that the uni-directional gateway is used in preference to this type of integration and that performance testing and tuning are performed prior to using such an integration in a production system.
