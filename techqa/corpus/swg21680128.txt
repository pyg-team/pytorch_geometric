ANSWER
The console text can be translated into the following languages:


 * Arabic (ar) 
 * Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br) 
 * Czech (cs) 
 * Croatian (hr) 
 * Dutch (nl) 
 * English (en) 
 * French (fr) 
 * German (de) 
 * Hungarian (hu) 
 * Italian (it) 
 * Japanese (ja) 
 * Korean (ko) 
 * Polish (pl) 
 * Russian (ru) 
 * Slovenian (sl) 
 * Swedish (sv) 
 * Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) 
 * Spanish (es) 
 * Traditional Chinese (zh-tw)
   
   The language that is displayed when you access the console is always the first language in your browser's language settings that matches one of these console translations. If none of your language preferences match one of the console translations, then the default is displayed, which is English (en). Individual components, such as widgets or dashboards, might provide additional translations that are displayed according to your browser's language settings. In this case, you could see a combination of languages displayed in the console.
   
   The console also supports bidirectional languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew, which are displayed and read from right to left. If your browser's first language preference is set to a bidirectional language, elements in the console are arranged in right-to-left orientation and the text is right-aligned, even though the displayed text might not be bidirectional.
