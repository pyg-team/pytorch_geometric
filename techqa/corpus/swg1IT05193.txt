ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We have a situation where leftover temp files from stellent
   crashes are filling up the Data Servers.  Our usual 5 day
   cleaning cycle isn't enough.  Even one day isn't enough at
   Hess.  We can work around the problem by adding the extensions
   of the files causing the issue to the skip extensions list, but
   since we are no longer spreading it out among multiple nodes,
   and since we don't have the same amount of space this is likely
   to be an issue going forward.  Here's some more details on what
   we're seeing.
   
   Sample list of files found in /deepfs/data/tmp

   This was just from the initial investigation, once we added
   these to the skipextensions table, restarted services and
   started the harvest over, the data server filled up again with
   more files with different extensions in /deepfs/data/tmp in
   less than 24 hours.  We repeated the process and over the past
   three days the data server has not filled up again.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  add extensions to skipextensions table
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  /deepfs/data/tmp/x_vp/siqtmp_* files not getting deleted on
   harvest
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ensure we cleanup outsidein wrapper notes related artifacts
