ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WLE 7.2 product migration to BPM 8.0.1 runs into OOM and other
   issues like slow performance
   
   Different parameters like the below needs to be tweaked to
   complete the product migration
   
   SET JVM_HEAPSIZE_OPTIONS="-Xms512m -Xmx8192m"
   
   
   set  worker.thread.size=5
   
   Set   database.batch.size=100
   
   Default values for these parameters may not work in many
   scenarios and needs to be tweaked. Also when run with the
   changed values, trc still says using default values though the
   threads being used seems to be different and reflecting the set
   value
   
   Can we print the values accordingly in the trc and and also
   change the Infocenter with details on what these parameters are
   and how to use them with sample values
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  change values
