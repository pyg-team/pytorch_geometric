PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains the post-installation steps in TXSeries after applying a Fixpack or a fix over the supported vendor supplied software.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. If MicroFocus Server Express COBOL is installed on the server, upgrade the cicsprCOBOL language method file(which contains the COBOL runtime and support routines) as follows: 

 *  Change the working directory to /var/cics_regions/region_name/bin and list the contents of the directory. 
 *  If cicsprCOBOL exists, delete and recreate it by using the cicsmkcobol command. If any region on the server uses a unique COBOL language method file, change the working directory to /var/cics_regions/region_name/bin for every region, remove the existing cicsprCOBOL file, and recreate it by using the cicsmkcobol command. 
 *  If a copy of cicsprCOBOL was built to support transactions using other products (such as a relational database management product), the cicsprCOBOL language method file has to be rebuilt using the same operands that were used originally. 

2. When a TXSeries region is configured with DB2 as the file manager and is started after installing a PTF or a Fixpack (TXSeries or fix on DB2), errors appear in the console file of the region, such as:  * 
 * 
 * 
   ERZ082008E/0179 12/04/09 13:35:59.850026262 testdb2 1 30380/0001: Attempt to obtain information for file: 'testdb2logtdq#' and index: 'dxtestdb2logtdq#' from 'DB2' system table 'sysindexes' was unsuccessful, SQL Code: -818 'SQL0818N A timestamp conflict occurred. SQLSTATE=51003 
 *  After installing the PTF or Fixpack, you need to run the following command: 
 *  cicsdb2conf -I -s -r region_name -C -i instance_name -a database_name 
 * This command will rebind the file management packages for the region that uses the database, and it then needs to be executed for all regions that connect to the database.


3. If any TXSeries applications on the server uses the XA interface for communicating with XA-enabled relational databases or Websphere MQ ,you should rebuild the switch load files (you do not need not rebuild switch load files if you are using CICS-supplied switch load files). 

4. The SARPCD process (RPC daemon) occasionally fails to start during startup after a Fixpack installation or uninstallation of TXSeries or any vendor supplied software fixes. This problem is observed only on UNIX-like platforms. To resolve the issue, follow the steps mentioned in the link:
