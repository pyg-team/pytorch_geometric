See the Announcement Letters for CICS products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21227090] if you are interested in upgrading to the latest release of CICS TS or any other CICS products.

Since it has been more than 2 years since EOS, IBM is NOT generally offering a fee based service extension for CICS TS V2.3. However, if you have a special situation, you should contact your sales representative who will put in a special bid request for you. A service extension entitles you to continue to receive the level of support that you receive today using the same channels into IBM, including raising PMRs and APARs.
