   delete
   is not working due to an incorrect condition being tested before
   the
   delete is performed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli Business Systems Manager      *
   *                 for DB2 V1R5 users.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During DB2 rediscovery, or poll monitor *
   *                      processing, the following messages are  *
   *                      returned:                               *
   *                      CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSNALI      *
   *                      EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT                *
   *                      IHS637E IHSBIFIC unable to load         *
   *                      DSNALI/DSNWLI2: Abend S906-8            *
   *                      The DB2 interface module DSNALI is      *
   *                      being loaded for execution but not      *
   *                      correctly unloaded afterwards.  Because *
   *                      of this the use count for load module   *
   *                      DSNALI continues to increase.  With the *
   *                      frequent execution of the poll monitor, *
   *                      the use count eventually exceeds the    *
   *                      limit of 32767.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During DB2 rediscovery, or poll monitor processing, the
   following messages are returned:
   CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSNALI EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   IHS637E IHSBIFIC unable to load DSNALI/DSNWLI2: Abend S906-8
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The unload of DSNALI is not working due to an incorrect
   condition being tested before the delete is performed.  This
   test will be corrected so that DSNALI is correctly unloaded.
