ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are migrating from CICS/TS 3.2 to CICS/TS 5.1 and the
   install of the pipeline fails with:
   DFHPI0917 W MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AORNAME WEBSERVICE
   might perform unpredictably as the PIPELINE PIPEname2 is
   non-SOAP.
   This problem only occurs when the closing service_handler_list
   element is part of a comment.
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): KIXREVSLY

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DFHPI0720 issued when installing a      *
   *                      pipeline.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In the reported problem, a configuration ( config ) file
   associated with a PIPELINE resource contained a comment
   of:  </service_handler_list >, the XML read:
   .
   <!-- </service_handler_list> -->
   .
   Which is a valid comment.  However, this was not treated as
   such.  DFHPIPL detects the service_handler_list end element and
   assumes that there are no more service handlers present in the
   file.  Message DFHPI0720 is issued when the valid service
   handlers are located.
