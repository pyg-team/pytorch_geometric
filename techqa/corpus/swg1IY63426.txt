APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a REFRESH CLUSTER customer repository manager repeatedly
   ended abnormally. We are miscalculating the SSLPeerNamePtr, an
   internal pointer to the SSL peer name string.
   
   The error will typically manifest as a SIGSEGV FDC from within
   the rrmPCFFromSSLPeerName function.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  IY58921 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY58921], IY59008 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY59008] and 82424,
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users utilising clustering and SSL.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Unix
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Mishandling of the SSL peer name in certain circumstances,
   dependent on the utilisation of clustering as a whole. Because
   these circumstances are difficult or impossible to delineate,
   customers utilising clustering with SSL are recommended to
   apply this fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Corrected the handling of the SSL peer name in a clustering
   context.
   
   The fix will be included in the following PTFs:
