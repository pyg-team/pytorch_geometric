LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you try to add a document to the repository, IBM Content
   Navigator attempts to modify system-defined hidden properties if
    you modify properties that are configured with external data
   service (EDS) dependent properties. This behavior can cause the
   Add action to fail with the following error message:
   
   Insufficient privileges to perform operation
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Content Navigator does not assign values to system-defined
   properties during the Add action.
