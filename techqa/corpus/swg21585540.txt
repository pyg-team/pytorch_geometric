PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the inbound process of a JDBC Adapter with a Microsoft SQL Server database, the JDBC Adapter is unable to re-establish connection with the database after Microsoft SQL Server is restarted. 

SYMPTOM
If the JDBC Adapter inbound process is configured to use a pre-defined data source to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database, JDBC Adapter is unable to re-establish the connection with the database after Microsoft SQL Server is restarted. The following error is encountered at runtime: 

J2CA0056I: The Connection Manager received a fatal connection error from the Resource 
Adapter for resource jdbc/MSSQL. The exception which was received is com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Connection reset


CAUSE
The problem occurs because a stale connection is used by the data source to establish the database connection.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0 to connect to the database when configuring JDBC Adapter to use a Microsoft SQL Server:
