PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Summarizes known issues and limitations when using Business Intelligence and Reporting tools (BIRT) to design and run ClearQuest reports. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You encounter error messages when designing and running ClearQuest reports using BIRT.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These are the known limitations and issues that can occur when using BIRT tools with ClearQuest reports. Click a topic for more information. 

 *  Issues with report URLs generated by the BIRT Report Viewer, versions 2.3.2.x and 2.5.x No report design object available Cannot find or process the com.ibm.rational.clearquest.oda.jdbc.data source CRVAP0049E Cannot instantiate protocol provider: cqjniproxy (Not found in java.library.path)#CRVAP0049E%20Cannot%20instantiate%20pro Exception running BIRT reports that contain charts BIRT Report Viewer does not display properly in load balanced environment Error running wsadmin command to replace BIRT web.xml 






Issues with report URLs generated by the BIRT Report Viewer, versions 2.3.2.x and 2.5.x. 

When using BIRT Report Viewer versions 2.3.2.x, and 2.5.x, you might experience problems with the URLs generated by the report viewer. For information about these problems, see Eclipse bug 282961 [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=282961]. 






Error message: There is no report design object available 

This error message might display when launching a report or opening a link to a subreport using BIRT 2.3.2 or higher, For a discussion of this error, see this Eclipse forum post [http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&goto=367339&S=164ca6c5cc1ce4c34abcf0e29c563893]. 

To resolve this issue, see the instructions for updating the BIRT web.xml in the Configuring the BIRT web archive on the WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSH5A_8.0.0/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.reporting.doc/topics/t_rpt_rl4birt_configl_on_WAS.htm] section of the ClearQuest product documentation. 






Cannot find or process the com.ibm.rational.clearquest.oda.jdbc .data source 

If the ClearQuest Reporting Driver is not deployed correctly in the BIRT server runtime environment, this error message is displayed:  * org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: An exception occurred during processing. Please see the following message for details: Cannot find or process the com.ibm.rational.clearquest.oda.jdbc.dataSource driver's data source extension configuration. com.ibm.rational.clearquest.oda.jdbc.dataSource


For Information about configuring and deploying the reporting driver, see Configuring the ClearQuest Reporting Driver [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSH5A_8.0.0/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.reporting.doc/topics/c_rpt_rd4cq.htm] in the ClearQuest product documentation. 





CRVAP0049E Cannot instantiate protocol provider: cqjniproxy (Not found in java.library.path) 

This error occurs when two different web applications attempt to access ClearQuest using the JNI adapter of the Change Management (CM) API. For example, if both BIRT and the ClearQuest Report Server for Crystal Reports are deployed to the same web server, only one of the server applications can run reports that use a Change Management API JNI data source (whichever connects first until profile restart). This problem does not occur for reports that use a Change Management Server data source. For information about defining Change Management Server data sources, see the ClearQuest product documentation topic Designing data-pull reports [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSH5A_8.0.0/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.user_ec.doc/topics/c_rpt_dpull_design.htm]. 





Exception running BIRT reports that contain charts 

If BIRT has not been configured and deployed to the WebSphere Application Server correctly, an exception error might occur when running reports that contain charts, The exception might vary depending on the BIRT runtime being used. For BIRTversion 2.6.1, this exception error message is displayed: 

java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError incompatible with java.lang.Exception 

To resolve this problem, review the Configuring the BIRT web archive on the WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSH5A_8.0.0/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.reporting.doc/topics/t_rpt_rl4birt_configl_on_WAS.htm] section in the ClearQuest product documentation to verify that all configuration and deployment steps are completed correctly. 





BIRT Report Viewer does not display properly in load balanced environment 

In a load balanced environment, the BIRT Report Viewer might display incorrectly. For example, icon graphics in the toolbar are missing and reports do not display correctly. If these problems occur, you can resolve them by updating the base_url parameter setting in the BIRT viewer.properties file. 

Updating the base_url parameter setting 
 1. Edit the BIRTviewer properties file:<profileName>/installedApps/dfltCell/birtEAR.ear/birt.war/WEB-INF/viewer.properties
    
 2. Change the base_url parameter value to the URL used to start the Report Launcher.
    For example, base_url=https://myserver.ibm.com
    
 3. Save the file.
    
 4. Restart the server to activate the change.






[Error%20running%20wsadmin%20command%20to%20replace%20BIRT%20web.xml] Error running wsadmin command to replace BIRT web.xml 

When attempting to run the wsadmin command to apply updates to BIRT web.xml you might encounter the following error: 

com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingException: WASX7280E: An application with name birt_war.ear does not exist. 

The BIRT enterprise application was likely deployed with a name other than the birt_war.ear, for example: birt_war 
 1. Use the Integrated Solutions Console to determine the name of the BIRT application in your environment. 
    
    See Configuring the BIRT web archive on the WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSH5A_8.0.0/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.reporting.doc/topics/t_rpt_rl4birt_configl_on_WAS.htm] for information about using the Integrated Solutions Console.
    
 2. Rerun the wsadmin command using the correct name for the BIRT application argument.
