Title: IBM Unable to successfully connect from SBI to WebSphere MQ 7.5 Server. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What WebSphere MQ 7.5 jar files are needed in Sterling B2B Integrator for them to communicate? 

SYMPTOM
Unable to successfully connect from SBI to WebSphere MQ 7.5 Server.


CAUSE
SBI dynamicclasspath.cfg file contains both MQ 7.0.1.x jar files entries and MQ 7.5 jars files. It should contain only 1 version of WebSphere MQ jar files. There should not be duplicate jars in the dynamicclasspath.cfg

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please be aware that the SBI 5.2.4.2 installation comes with the below MQ 7.0.1.x jar files/entries (and maybe some others) already present in the dynamicclasspath.cfg file for SBI, for example:
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mq.commonservic
es.jar
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mq.headers.jar
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mq.jar
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar
VENDOR_JAR={SI_install_dir}/jar/mqseries/7_0_1_6/com.ibm.mqjms.jar

These jar file works well when connecting to WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.
But if you want to connect to a higher version of WebSphere MQ Server (e.g. v7.5), currently you MUST first manually remove all of these older existing MQ 7.0.1.x jar files from the dynamicclasspath.cfg file.


Next you need to install all of the new client jar files from the WebSphere MQ 7.5 Server library into SBI using the install3rdParty script which is under the SBI /bin dir. You should be able to install all of the new MQ 7.5 jars in one execution just by using an asterisk for the jar file names, or you can install each of the new jars one at a time. 


Next, restart SBI and configure the WebSphere adapter correctly in SBI to communicate with WebSphere MQ 7.5 Server.

Again, if you forget to uninstall any of the older existing 7_0_1_6 jars from SBI, and then install the new WebSphere MQ (e.g. v7.5) jars, then there will be duplicate jars in the dynamicclasspath.cfg and this can cause issues as well.
