QUESTION
 How does the IBM Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE) re-index manage memory? 

CAUSE
When you run a re-index in LQE you will notice that the memory on the machine will increase. When the process completes the memory will not necessarily be released.

ANSWER
LQE uses Jena TDB [https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/] as a memory-mapped model. This means the operating system manages the swapping of the index data in/out of RAM memory.
Just because the RAM usage did not decrease is not a problem, this is up to the operating system and in some cases the Operating System didn't need to swap out or reduce the amount of RAM used. The Operating System is in control of the non-heap RAM memory used for memory mapping. There may be other factors involved, but this is not an issue or a concern, except with how much swapping may happen when the RAM is too little and the index db is too big. 

Note: It is not a good idea to run a 're-index all' too frequently. In order to improve search performance the indexer does not delete data. So if the 're-index' removes data then the space is not recovered in the database. You would have to run a compress to recover the space.
