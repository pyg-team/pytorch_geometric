 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager and IBM WebSphere Application Server shipped as a component of IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]

DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
