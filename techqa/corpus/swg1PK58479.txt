APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Descriptions:
   
   Jvm was not able to start because of too many open file error.
   Error:
   [10/22/07 10:25:02:892 EDT] 0000000a ModuleManifes E
   UTLS0002E: The shared library AlertFwk_LIB contains a classpath
   entry which does not resolve to a valid jar file, the library
   jar file is expected to be found.
   ...
    (Too many open files)
         at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)

   java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:129)
         at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:89)
   
   ...
   Cause:The application server opens all shared libraries jars in
   order to implement installed optional package support.
   
   It appears that there is a bug in this code that prevents it
   from closing jar files when it opens them for scanning.  As a
   result, these jar files are only closed when garbage collection
   occurs, which could cause too many open file error.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IBM WebSphere Application Server versions    *
   *                 6.0.2 and 6.1 users with very many shared    *
   *                 library jar files.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Unexpected FileNotFoundExceptions       *
   *                      will be thrown during server startup    *
   *                      with the message: Too many open files   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   All shared library jar files are opened during server startup
   in order to implement installed optional package support, but
   the jar files are not explicitly closed after they are
   inspected. Consequently, the jar files are only closed when
   the garbage collector finalizes them, which might not occur
   before other files need to be opened.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Shared library jar files are always explicitly closed after
   they are inspected for installed optional package metadata.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 6.0.2.27 and 6.1.0.17.
