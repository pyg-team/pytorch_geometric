ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create a report in the Report Designer widget that
   contains spaces in the name, save this new report, and later
   access the report, the report name displays with an escape
   sequence of "%20" in place of the space character. Then, when
   you try to save the modifications to the report, you receive the
    following message: "An error occurred while saving the report."

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Report Designer widget logic to save a report included
   extraneous encoding of a space character when handling a report
   that had previously been saved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be incorporated into a later release that allows the
   Report Designer widget to modify a report that has spaces in the
    name.
