APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While integrating DataPower with Oracle OWSM, certain
   WS-Security policy assertions specified in the WSDL
   are not handled by DataPower correctly.  For example,
   when sign and encrypt actions are auto generated by Web
   Service Proxy (WSP), they do not exactly correspond to the
   WS-Security policy assertions in some cases.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a Multi-protocol Gateway (MPGW) to generate the sign and
   encrypt actions with the right configuration parameters that
   correspond to the WS-Security policy assertion specified in the
   WSDL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When multiple conflicting assertions are specified in the
   Security Policy, DataPower enforces all of the assertions which
   could result in interoperability failures with other systems
   like .NET  and OWSM. DataPower will be changed to interoperate
   with these systems with the specified security policy
   assertions.
   
   Fix will be available in a future major release.
