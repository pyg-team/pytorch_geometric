Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway are affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 and CVE-2014-0076) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenSSL libraries which a customer may use with the SWIFTNet adapters IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Although the product does not ship with OpenSSL, SWIFTNet adapters of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway may be configured by the customer to use OpenSSL libraries for cryptography. If a customer has downloaded and is using OpenSSL libraries Version 1.0.1 with the SWIFTNet adapters, then the following security vulnerabilities discovered in OpenSSL libraries Version 1.0.1 are applicable. IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway customers who do not use OpenSSL with the SWIFTNet adapters are not impacted by this vulnerability.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: : OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affects confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2.x or IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2.x. Prior versions of Sterling Integrator and Sterling File Gateway are not impacted by this issue. 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Customer must upgrade their current version of OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g

After upgrading OpenSSL to 1.0.1g, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160:

1) Replace your SSL Certificates. 

 * 
 * 

2) Reset User Credentials  * 


Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None Known
