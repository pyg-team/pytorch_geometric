Title: IBM Listener Status Data Unavailable on z/OS Workspace - United States

Text:
z/os listener status attribute queue manager port QMLISTEN TCP/IP TCPIP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We want to monitor the listener port for a z/OS queue manager, however, we are unable to view the listener status from Tivoli portal. From the Tivoli portal, the listener port always displays for queue managers on windows servers and Unix servers, but never displays for the mainframe queue manager. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Listener Status attribute group does not apply to z/OS. Different from WebSphere MQ on distributed platforms, there is no explicit definition of LISTENER objects on WebSphere MQ on z/OS. DEFINE LISTENER, DISPLAY LISTENER and DEFINE LISTENER are not available on z/OS. Instead, a LISTENER is implicitly created/destroyed via START/STOP LISTENER commands. 

For z/OS, the TCPIP Started Listeners (QMLISTEN) attribute groups can be used to set up situations to monitor listener status. Unfortunately, it does have limitations. If it can be sure that the specific LISTENER will always be started at Queue Manager starting up and will not be stopped while queue manager is active, then a situation can be created to monitor the status based on the PORT NUMBER and the RETRYING status. The problem is that a situation cannot be created to detect stopped listeners. In the situation definition, the framework MISSING function cannot be applied to the PORT NUMBER attribute because it is Integer type. MISSING function can only be used for string type attributes. To support this usage, either ITM needs to be enhanced to support MISSING function for Integer type attributes or the MQ agent needs to be enhanced to add a new attribute to assign an implicit name for MQ listeners on z/OS.
