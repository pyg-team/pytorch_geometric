LEAP SECOND TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is LEAP SECONDS / LEAP SECOND have any negative effect on TKLM / SKLM? 

ANSWER
The "Leap Second" / "Leap Seconds" will not affect TKLM/SKLM. 
No negative impact if the leap second is not added. 

SKLM is not a time keeper. 
TKLM / SKLM takes the 'time' from the host system - System level or NTP Server level. 

LEAP SECONDS has been added on June 30.
