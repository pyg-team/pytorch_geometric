 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You want to compile a WebSphere MQ (WMQ) JMS program that will run under the WebSphere Application Server (WAS). You notice that the MQ JMS jar files provided with WAS have different sizes than the corresponding MQ JMS far files from a stand-alone installation of the MQ client, even though the jar files are for the same version of MQ. You have some questions such as:
- Why is there a difference in size?
- Which set of MQ JMS jar files are you recommended to use?
- Is it OK to compile the JMS program under the stand-alone MQ installation and then run the program under WAS?

To give a specific example, you are using WAS 8.5.0.1, which provides the MQ JMS Resource Adapter at level 7.1.0.1 (signature in the traces: 7.1.0.1-k710-001-120424)
Notice the difference in file sizes:

* Shipped with stand-alone MQ 7.1.0.1: 
/opt/mqm7101/java/lib

ANSWER
The WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter shipped with WAS is packaged based on the JCA interface so that it can be used for J2EE compliant environments. 
The WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter contains the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with the addition of some additional classes to provide the J2EE capability. Hence the size of MQ library files in the WebSphere MQ client (that is, WebSphere MQ classes for JMS) and the WebSphere MQ library files in WebSphere Application Server (that is, WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter) are different sizes. 

Both of these clients (WebSphere MQ client and WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter) provide the same WebSphere MQ API and so the code compiled against the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS will run inside an application server with WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter at the same level.
