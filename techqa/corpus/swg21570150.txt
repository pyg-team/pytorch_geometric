Title: IBM TSAMP Operations Console installer launch problem - United States

Text:
TSAMP; TSA; OC; console; -i console; setup.bin TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running 'setup.bin -i console' results in "Installer User Interface Mode Note Supported". Trying to install Operations Console without X Windows. 

SYMPTOM
According to the Installation and Configuration Guide, the Operations Console is installed by running the 'setup.bin' executable. This launches an installation tool common to many products and as such it accepts the -i console command line option. At first glance this would seem like a suitable installation method for an environment that does not have X-Windows,

Installer User Interface Mode Not Supported

The installer cannot run in this UI mode.


CAUSE
"console" mode not supported installation method


ENVIRONMENT
AIX and Linux



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are only two supported methods for installing the Operations Console: 

- You can use a graphical installation program, the so-called installation wizard.
- You can install the operations console in silent mode, using a response file you generated in a previous wizard-driven installation.

... this would account for the message stating that the installation mode is not supported.

The Installation Guide includes X Windows as a prerequisite for the OC on Linux and AIX systems.
