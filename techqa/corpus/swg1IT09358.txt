APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Affected are DataPower MultiProtocol Gateway (MPGW), Web
   Service Proxy (WSP) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) services.
   The services don't preserve HTTP Content-Length header larger
   than 32k if the following conditions are met:
   - HTTP 1.0 on the request side
         (either forced by FSH or by request)
   - Response Type in MPGW/WSP/WAF is set to passthrough
   - Backend does send Content-Length header
   Please be aware of these specific conditions. As other cases
   allow to omit Content-Length header following RFC 2626 Section
   4.4.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use XML Firewall service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected might be the customers using the Multi-Protocol
   Gateway, Web Service Proxy or Web Application Firewall with a
   HTTP(S) 1.0 Front Side Handler.
   
   When the Response Type of the service is Pass through, the
   Content-Length HTTP header is preserved from backside to
   frontside only when the original content is less than or equal
   32000 bytes. When bigger, the header is not included.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.16, 6.0.1.12, 7.0.0.9, 7.1.0.6 and
   7.2.0.2.
