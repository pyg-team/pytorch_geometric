SOFTWARE PLANNING
The following products and functions which were supported on IBM i 6.1 are not supported on IBM i 7.1. Plans should be made to replace or discontinue use of these products and functions prior to upgrading to i 7.1.

Software Suggested replacement IBM Navigator for i Due to changes in how browsers handle self-signed certificates, IBM Navigator for i will no longer be shipped with SSL enabled by default. Users can configure SSL using the instructions found at this link: http://ibm.co/2f1vzYU [http://ibm.co/2f1vzYU]. In addition, any saved URL's for IBM Navigator for i will not work by default because we are now using HTTP and port 2004 instead of HTTPS and port 2005. 5722-WE2 IBM Web Enablement for i Migrate to IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5 or higher. Older versions of WebSphere Application Server require Java 6 which will be going out of service in December 2017. 5733-W80 IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.0 Migrate to IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5 or higher.

Lotus products for IBM i (Domino, Quickr, Sametime, etc.) Most of the currently available Lotus products require the most recent release for use on IBM i 7.1.

However, the VMware ESX hosted Linux servers would not support save while active, file level backup, or virtual optical and tape support. For Linux running in IBM i hosted partitions, IBM continues to support hosting of Linux partitions on the i operating system but save while active and file level backup is not supported with the IBM i 7.1 release.
