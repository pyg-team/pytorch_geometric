APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A topic/connection factory connection is made for a JMS client
   connection from WebSphere Application Server (WAS) to an MQ
   queue manager.  Errors include:
   
   ConnectionEve W   J2CA0206W: A connection error occurred.  To
   help determine the problem, enable the Diagnose Connection
   Usage option on the Connection Factory or Data Source. This is
   the multithreaded access detection option. Alternatively check
   that the Database or MessageProvider is available.
   
   ConnectionEve A   J2CA0056I: The Connection Manager received a
   fatal connection error from the Resource Adapter for resource
   <connection factory name>.
   
   The exception is: com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedJMSException:
   JMSWMQ0026: Failed to subscribe to topic '<topicname>' using
   MQSUB. There may have been a problem creating the subscription
   due to it being used by another message consumer.
   Make sure any message consumers using this subscription are
   closed before trying to create a new subscription under the
   same name. Please see the linked exception for more
   information.:com.ibm.mq.MQException:
   
   JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2'
   ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2195' ('MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR').

LOCAL FIX
 *  Temporarily set the channel so that it does not used shared
   conversations:
   ALTER CHANNEL(channel_name) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) SHARECNV(0)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   IBM i users of MQSUB over a channel connection.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   IBM iSeries
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The MQSUB call in MQ is transactional in nature and will attempt
   to perform an internal commitment control when called. These
   transactions may sometimes fail when performed over a channel
   connection where multiplexing (Sharing Conversations) is
   enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM MQ code has been modified to ensure that internal
   transactions invoked by MQSUB always have a valid transaction
   type.
