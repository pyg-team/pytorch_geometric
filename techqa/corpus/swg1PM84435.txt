TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The Cognos software is behaving as designed. Supporting SSL comm
   unication between the query service and report service was funct
   ionality the current versions of Cognos BI was intended to suppo
   rt. This has been accepted an enhancement request and will be im
   plemented in a future version of Cognos BI.
   
   Note that:
   - this is about enabling SSL communication between internal comp
   onents within the same Cognos BI server
   - this is not about enabling SSL between nodes that can exist on
    different computers.
