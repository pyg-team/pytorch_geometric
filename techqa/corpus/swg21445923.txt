 2. Navigate to the following directory: WebSphere_install_location/profiles/profile_name/temp/node_name/server_name/ 
 3. Delete the ramhelp_war or iehs_war directory and all of the files and folders in it. 
 4. In a WebSphere Application Server ND environment, repeat steps 2 and 3 for every application server and node in your cluster that hosted the help application.
