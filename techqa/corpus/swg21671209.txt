Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere Guardium Database Activity Monitoring is affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0076, CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL that affect a 3rd party Component used by IBM InfoSphere Guardium.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS: 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 


AFFECTED PRODUCTS: 

Only version 64 bit Central Manager and Managed Unit machines with version v9 patch 50 or greater are affected. 


REMEDIATION/FIXES: The recommended solution is to apply the v9.0p200 and v9.0p1028 fixes as soon as possible. However, customers that do not want to apply v9.0p200 may decide to only apply v9.0p1030 which only contains the fix for the vulnerable component.

For 9 versions less than v9.0p200
- Apply the following iFixes located here: 

http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Guardium&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=SqlGuard-9.0p1030&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Guardium&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=SqlGuard-9.0p1030&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc]


For versions v9.0p200, apply the fix here:
