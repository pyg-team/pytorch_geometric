Title: IBM COI/DE failure to install ITNM IP 3.8 FP3 when TBSM is local and TIP is not - United States

Text:
COI/DE listIU.sh ncp_tip_setup ncp_war_files ncp_reports TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITNN IP 3.8 Fixpack 3 Core Product fails to install whenever TBSM is installed
locally, but TIP is not installed locally. 

SYMPTOM
 

Fatal Error: Unable to configure COI/DE packages for Installation

Err Message: The attempt to modify the COI/DE packages in the fixpack to install on this system returned the following error message: Unable to find SIU UUID for ncp_guicommon via listIU.sh command
Unable to find SIU UUID for ncp_war_files via listIU.sh command
Unable to find SIU UUID for ncp_tip_setup via listIU.sh command
Unable to find SIU UUID for ncp_reports via listIU.sh command


CAUSE
The reason why the installer attempts to install the TIP updates is because 

it sourced in the environment variables with the $NCHOME/env.sh script to 
get the TIPHome location and then checked and found a valid TIP entry in 
the TIPHOME location. Therefore, because there is a valid TIPHOME 
defined in the env.sh script, the installer assumes that the ITNM GUI must be 
installed there, and hence, the installer looks for the ITNM GUI components 
in the TIP DE database and errors out when it does not find them.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The TIP/ITNM GUI and ITNM Core use different install mechanisms, and 

it is difficult to get both those mechanisms to work correctly and consistently 
in a multi-system environment. There is a bug in the installer mechanism 
under the situation where TIPHOME exists but does not contain the ITNM 
GUI.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Modify the $NCHOME/env.sh script to make TIPHOME undefined, and 
make sure that TIPHOME is not defined in the environment of the command 
window in which the installer is started. That way, the installer cannot find a 
TIPHOME and assumes that it is not meant to be installed.
