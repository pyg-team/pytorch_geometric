To set a webcontainer custom property on WebSphere Application Server Version 6 using wsadmin: 
 1. Create a jacl script to add/update the custom property. 
 2. Ensure that the server is running. 
 3. Run the jacl script in wsadmin using "wsadmin -f <scriptName>.jacl 
 4. Restart the server for the custom property to take effect.




An example jacl script which creates a webcontainer custom property, after deleting any current instances of the property being added, might contain the following but with lines 2 to 6 modified to specify appropriate values for <cell of server>, <node of server>, <server to create property for>,<webcontainer property name> and <webcontainer property value>: 

# set variables
set cellName <cell of server>
set nodeName <node of server>
set serverName <server to create property for>
set propertyName <webcontainer property name>
set propertyValue <webcontainer property value>
# define some helper variables
set a1 [list name $propertyName]
set a2 [list value $propertyValue]
set attrs [list $a1 $a2]
# get server config
set server [$AdminConfig getid
/Cell:$cellName/Node:$nodeName/Server:$serverName/]
#get the webcontainer config from the server config
set webcontainer [$AdminConfig list WebContainer $server]
# get a list of existing webcontainer properties 
set webcontainerProperties [$AdminConfig list Property $webcontainer]
# Check for existing properties with the same name and delete if found
if { ${webcontainerProperties} != "" } { 
foreach propertyID ${webcontainerProperties} {
set propertyIDName [$AdminConfig showAttribute $propertyID name]
set match [string match $propertyIDName $propertyName] 
if { ${match} == 1 } {
$AdminConfig remove $propertyID
}
}
} 
# Create the specified property
$AdminConfig create Property $webcontainer $attrs 
# Save updates
$AdminConfig save
