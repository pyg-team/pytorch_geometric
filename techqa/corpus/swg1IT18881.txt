APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users could not edit or deploy virtual system patterns when
   the external IBM Installation Manager (IIM) repository was
   unavailable.
   
   It was found after investigation that the line:
   "repository.internal.url=../"
   
   is missing from the following internal system configuration
   file:
   "/drouter/ramdisk2/mnt/raid-volume/raid0/imrepo/IMRepository
       /Compo/repository.config".
   
   As a result, only the external IIM repository is visible from
   the IBM Pattern Builder and deployment system.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact IBM Support to verify the problem and modify the
   configuration file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Code has been added to regenerate the internal IBM
   Installation Manager configuration entry in the
   configuration file if it is missing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in the Foundation Pattern
   Type version 2.1.9.0 provided with PureApplication System
   and BlueMix Local System version 2.2.3.0.
