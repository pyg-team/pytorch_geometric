PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to migrate IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software to V8.0 and IBM WebSphere Application Aerver runtime to V7.0 at the same time causes the Runtime 'Classpath Provider warning' against the older server runtime classpath entry. 

SYMPTOM
The following warning may be displayed in the 'Problems View', even if the v6.0 server runtime is no longer being used as a result of the migration. 

Classpath entry com..ibm.wtp.server.java.core.container/com.ibm.ws.ast.st.runtime.core.runtimeTarget.v60/was.base.v6 will not be exported or published. Runtime ClassNotFoundExceptions may result.



CAUSE
The 'Runtime Classpath Provider' in this warning is a classpath from an earlier version of Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, even before 7.5. 

The classpath was not removed to keep backward compatibility, but it was exposed as a warning for you to determine the right path for the environment.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Choose one of the following options to resolve the issue. 

 

 * Delete the 'Runtime Classpath Provider' entry
   
   It is safe to delete the Runtime Classpath Provider if:  * You have already migrated the project to 8.0 and everything is running without problems 
    * You do not have a need to bring the project back to version 7.x
   
   


 * Keep the 'Runtime Classpath Provider' and follow the 'Quick Fix'
   
   The warning can be fixed by right click the warning in the 'Server View' > [Quick Fix]. 
   
   It is best to use this option if:  * If you have a need to bring the project back to version 7.x 
    * You are sharing the project with other developers
