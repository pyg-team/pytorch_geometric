Title: IBM Stopping the wrapping of a title in IBM SPSS Statistics - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using IBM SPSS Statistics and the custom tables module. My table titles are wrapping which I do not want. I want my titles to not wrap at all. How can I do this through syntax? 

SYMPTOM
titles wrapping on table


CAUSE
acting as designed

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM SPSS Statistics is acting as designed. The table title will wrap when it reaches the end of the table. However if you specify a large enough custom minimum column length, then the table produced will be large enough to stop the title from wrapping. You would use MINCOLWIDTH in the /FORMAT subcommand in the CTABLES command using in IBM SPSS Command syntax. See the example below:

CTABLES
/FORMAT EMPTY=ZERO MISSING='.' MINCOLWIDTH=71 MAXCOLWIDTH=72
UNITS=POINTS
