ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Basically what I am seeing is that if I try to login to a
   Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2 system joined to either of our 2 AD
   forests, and login using the opposite domain FQDN\username, the
   ESSO agent will not auto login.
   I say opposite, because using either single label or FQDN domain
   name for the user login that matches machine domain membership
   works.  If I use the single-label name/netbios name of the
   domain, it works fine.  No errors on box nor DC's when this
   happens either (was originally thinking  problem, but don't see
   any evidence of that).
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Normally, I wouldn't care about this, since users hate typing in
   FQDN's
   anyway, but the place where it's causing a problem is in my VDI
   environments where I am using pass-thru authentication from
   users PC's..
   when pass-thru is used, it logs the user in using the domain
   FQDN.. on
   Windows 7 boxes anyway.  On my WinXP VDI environments, it logs
   them in
   as
   
   
   
   I have attached logs (level 3) from a login attempt that SSO
   worked, and
   one where it failed, so hopefully you can see what's going on.
   I am
   using
   the 8.2 agent and recently patched to FP11, but the issue still
   persists.
   
   If you need me to do any more testing or log collection, let me
   know.
