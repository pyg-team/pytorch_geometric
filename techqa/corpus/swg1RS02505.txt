ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ClassCastException from condition in definitions -
   IlrGroupAggregate incompatible with model.events.Interaction:
   
   set 'active previous updates' to all interactions
   where the employee of each interaction is the employee of 'the
   update'
   and the id of each interaction is the id of 'the update'
   and the update id of each interaction is not one of the update
   ids of 'already invalidated';
   
   When I invoke the rule, I get the following exception:
   
   Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: com.ibm.rules.engine.
   algo.runtime.aggregate.IlrGroupAggregate incompatible with
   model.events.Interaction
                   at com.ibm.brl.generated.engine.CondExecEnv.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Split the definition up into 2 steps, the
   exception goes away.
   
   set 'previous updates' to all interactions
   where the employee of each interaction is the employee of 'the
   update'
   and the id of each interaction is the id of 'the update';
   
   set 'active previous updates' to all interactions in 'previous
   updates'
   where the update id of each interaction is not one of the
   update ids of 'already invalidated'
