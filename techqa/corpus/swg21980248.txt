QUESTION
 JavaScript example of how to change a document's existing class using bulk processing with Administration Console for Content Engine (ACCE) 

ANSWER
In the Administration Console for Content Engine (ACCE) you can apply JavaScript bulk actions to the search results of an object store query. This example shows how to change a document's existing class to the desired one using the Content Platform Engine Java API and Java class libraries.
1. Open an object store and create an object store search.
2. On the SQL view tab, enter the following query:

SELECT TOP 100 This FROM Document

3. Select Enable bulk action on the bulk action tab.
4. In the Script section, click Run script.
5. Copy the following JavaScript code and paste it into the Script field.

Note: Use the symbolic name rather than the display name. You can use this as the base for making other modifications also. I am using the "TestClass" document class in the below example.


 * importClass(Packages.com.filenet.api.constants.RefreshMode);
 * 
 * 
 * function OnCustomProcess (CEObject)
 * 
 * {
 * 
 *  CEObject.changeClass("TestClass");
 * 
 *  CEObject.save(RefreshMode.REFRESH);
 * 
 * }
 * 

6. Click Run. The administration console runs the query and the JavaScript action. 

After the query runs, confirm that the document's class has been changed.
