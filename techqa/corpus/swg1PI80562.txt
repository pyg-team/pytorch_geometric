APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When syndication is used to update an existing item on the
   
   subscriber, the internal UUID of the any element (such as a
   file
   resource element on a content) that already exists on the item
   
   is not updated/corrected to match the corresponding item
   
   resource element from source item on the syndicator.
   
   
   
   Example: If a content contains a file resource element, then
   the
   direct link to the file attachment from both the syndicator and
   subscriber server may not match (as the resource URL is based
   on
   the internal ID of the resource element itself).
   
   
   
   If the corresponding item on the subscriber does not contain an
   element with the same name or the actual item itself does not
   
   exist at all on the subscriber server, then syndication will
   add
   the element correctly to the target item with the same matching
   internal UUID.
   
   
   
   Note: Syndication will always preserve the internal UUID for
   
   elements and resources. If a library export/import is performed
   or was used in the past to populate the server with initial
   
   data, then the internal resource UUID will not be preserved.
