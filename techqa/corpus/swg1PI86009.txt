APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is trying to get CICS Explorer working in his new
   CICS TS z/VSE V2.1.0 (z/VSE V6.1) environment.
   A connect fails with MSG IZE0106E Connect failed with error
   "Premature end of file." comes up at the CICS Explorer.
   
   The customer defined CLINTCP=8859-2 and SRVERCP=870 for
   DFHWBHH and DFHWBUD in DFHCNV.
   
   Auxtrace show that CICS does not use the
   CLINTCP and SRVERCP defined in DFHCNV which then leads to
   response not sent to the CICS Explorer client and the IZE0106E
   comes up.
   
   DFHSIT parameter:
   
   DOCCODEPAGE=870
   LOCALCCSID=870
   CLINTCP=8859-2
   SRVERCP=870

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS Explorer requests fail to connect  *
   *                      to the CICS region via the CICS         *
   *                      management client interface when a      *
   *                      DOCCODEPAGE value of 870 is used.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: .                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   When DOCCODEPAGE is set to a non Latin-1 character set the
   attempt to convert the response to the Explorer fails. This
   results in a connection failure and the Explorer issues
   message "IZE0106E Connect failed with error "Premature end of
   file."" at CICS TS for z/VSE 2.1 and message "IZE0106E Connect
   failed with error "Read timed out"" at CICS TS for z/VSE 2.2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Both DFHWUIPG and DFHWUWEB have been altered to ensure that the
   HOSTCODEPAGE parameter is added to EXEC CICS DOCUMENT CREATE and
   the EXEC CICS DOCUMENT INSERT calls made within them.
