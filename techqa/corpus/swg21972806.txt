 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How can I extract a listing of Collaboration and Deployment Services repository users?
How can I run a report which lists all C&DS repository users?


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To extract the list of C&DS repository users, you can run a query against some of the C&DS repository database tables.

The table "SPSSSEC_PRINCIPALS" contains a list of all users, groups, and roles defined in the repository. The key fields are the NAME field and the TYPE field. TYPE dictates if the object is a user (0), group(1), or role(2).

If you are only using the local security provider, then this should be sufficient. Query all NAMEs from that table with a TYPE=0 to get the list of C&DS users.

Example of SELECT to get Local repository users

SELECT
NAME
FROM
dbo.SPSSSEC_PRINCIPALS
WHERE
PRINCIPALID LIKE '%uNative%'
WHERE PRINCIPALID LIKE '%uNative%'

If you have defined one or more external security providers (LDAP or Active Directory for instance) you need to query the SPSSSEC_HIERARCHY table.
The "SPSSSEC_HIERARCHY" table has two fields CHILD and PARENT. 
Both reference the PRINCIPALID values from the "SPSSSEC_PRINCIPALS" table.
Querying this table allows you to extract a list of both local and external users.
Note: This list would not include locally defined users which have not been granted a role or group membership.
A user must belong to a role (or to a group which has a role assigned) to have any permissions on the system.
