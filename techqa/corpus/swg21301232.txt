QUESTION
 How do I increase the hard and soft limit with minimal impact to the object server on OMNIbus? 

CAUSE
Alert table size reached the maximum size.

ANSWER
 

When the alerts database becomes exceptionally large, the following message may be logged in the object server log:

Region soft limit exceeded

This means that the table_store memstore, where alert table data is stored, has reached its maximum size. You can use the ALTER MEMSTORE command to change the soft limit. For example, in nco_sql, enter:

ALTER MEMSTORE table_store SET SOFT LIMIT 500 M;

The soft limit cannot be set to a larger size than the hard limit, which you can change using the nco_store_resize utility. This utility enables you to change the hard limit for the table_store memstore for the specified ObjectServer.

Note: Before you run the nco_store_resize utility, you must back up the ObjectServer by using the ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP command, and then shutdown the ObjectServer.

Refer to IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus: Administration Guide for additional information, including the nco_store_resize utility. 

Note: On HP-UX platforms, Pre - 7.2, the maximum size of the memstore must not exceed 600 MB. If this size is exceeded, the ObjectServer will fail to start. Starting from 7.2 the maximum size of the memstore is 1.5 GB.
