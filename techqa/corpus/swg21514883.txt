PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the services tier installation, the installation program cannot connect to DB2 Database if you provide an IPv6 address as a host name in the Database connect screen. 

CAUSE
The DB2 JDBC driver version which is used by the installation program does not support IPv6 addresses. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The following error message is displayed on the user interface as well as in the installation log file: 

FAILED: CDIPR2079I: Ensure that user xmeta can connect to the database xmeta on host <IPv6 Address> at port number 50000 and has create table, create view, create index, and create trigger rights. Resolution: Ensure that user xmeta can connect to database xmeta on host 2002:920:c000:213:9:32:213:180 at port number 50000 and has create table, create view, create index, and create trigger rights.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Specify the host name instead of the IPv6 address in the Host Name field of the Database connection screen.
