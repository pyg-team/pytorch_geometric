PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Java 8 package should be selected       *
   *                      automatically when Edge Load Balancer   *
   *                      package is selected.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When both the repositories for EDGE and JDK8 are included in
   Installation Manager 1.8.5 repositories and you select
   "IBM WebSphere Edge Components: Load Balancer for IPV4 and
   IPV6", the "IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8"
   selection that is coupled with it is not selected
   automatically. Instead the user gets a message saying "The IBM
   WebSphere Edge Components: Load Balancer for IPV4 and IPV6
   package requires the IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version
   8 package".
   The Installation Manager checks a EDGE ULB Offering property
   to decide whether or not the JDK8 should be automatically
   selected after you select EDGE ULB. The problem is that the
   property is not coded correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The property was updated.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 9.0.0.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
