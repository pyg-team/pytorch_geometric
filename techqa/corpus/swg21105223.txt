QUESTION
 How do you use the CICS VSAM Recovery (CICS VR) panel interface to create and submit a recovery job for a VSAM sphere? You have multiple log of logs that contain information about the VSAM sphere registered to CICS VR. However, you do NOT want CICS VR to automatically scan all of them when creating the recovery job. 

ANSWER
Do the following to scan a specific log of logs: 

 1. Run a batch log of logs scan job [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwig/lgl.html] specifying the NAME(log of logs) keyword, where "log of logs" is the name that contains information about the VSAM sphere that needs to be recovered. 
    
    
 2. Invoke the CICS VR panel interface, and select option 6 for "Set scan option" from the Tools menu [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwug/dwwug00057.html] before selecting a recovery action from the VSAM sphere list. 
    
    
 3. On the CICS VR scan option panel [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwug/dwwug00061.html], enter 2 for "No scan is needed" in the scan option and press Enter. 
    
    
 4. Now when you select a recovery action, CICS VR will not automatically scan the registered log of logs.
