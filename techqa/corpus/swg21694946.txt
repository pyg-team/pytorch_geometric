Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is an insecure certificate validation (CVE-2012-5784, CVE-2014-3596) in Apache Axis which is contained in IBM WebSphere Portal. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2012-5784 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5784]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Axis 1.4, as used in multiple products, could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server and launch further attacks against a vulnerable target.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79829] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3596 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3596]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Axis and Axis2 could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by and incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95377 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95377] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The following IBM WebSphere Portal versions contain a version of Apache Axis with the insecure certificate validation: 


WebSphere Portal 8.5
WebSphere Portal 8.0
WebSphere Portal 7.0
WebSphere Portal 6.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM WebSphere Portal code is not affected. But since a version of Apache Axis 1 (axis.jar) is part of the classpath and this way available to custom code, you need to investigate, whether your custom code makes use of Apache Axis and is affected by this issue.

Please note: IBM does not plan on shipping any fix for Apache Axis 1.x (in the context of IBM WebSphere Portal). 

You will need to take one of the following actions, if your custom code makes use of Apache Axis: 

 1. Upgrade your custom code to use a current level of Apache Axis
    or 
 2. Include a copy of the Apache Axis 1.x package from Apache that contains a fix as part of your custom code.

In both cases take care that the updated version takes precedence in classpath (See also section "Class Loading" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/trun_classload.html?cp=SSEQTP_8.5.5%2F1-8-2-5&lang=en] in the IBM Application Server documentation). 

Important! APAR PI66773 contained in IBM WebSphere Portal 8.5 CF12 removes the Apache Axis 1.x library from the classpath. (See also corresponding Flash ' IBM WebSphere Portal 8.5 CF12 removing Apache Axis from the classpath [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988112]') WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
