PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus
   using the SOAP Request node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If a SOAP request over HTTP results in a fault response, an
   attempt is made to create a SOAP fault message before checking
   if the response is an actual SOAP fault, or a simple HTTP error.
   If the response is not a SOAP fault, the product fails trying to
   create the fault message because the response is not in the
   expected SOAP format. The initial response failure is not
   reported before the 'The markup in the document preceding the
   root element must be well-formed.' error is reported.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now reports the initial HTTP response failure if the
   SOAP fault parse fails.
