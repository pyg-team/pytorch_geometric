Title: IBM Disable the Creation of Files Within /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Some Java applications can create thousands of files within the /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach directory. 

CAUSE
These directories are created for each JVM job to support attach handlers.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You should do the following:


1. Edit or create the following file: 

/QIBM/UserData/Java400/SystemDefault.properties: 

2. Add the following entries:

#AllowOptions
com.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no 
com.ibm.tools.attach.logging=no

Example

....+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+..
************Beginning of data**************
#AllowOptions
com.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no
com.ibm.tools.attach.logging=no

3. Ensure there are no additional spaces behind the value 'no'.

Note: All JVMs must be restarted for this to take effect. This will affect only new JVMs.
