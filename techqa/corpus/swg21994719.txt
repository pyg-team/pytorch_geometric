SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities affecting Apache Poi as used in IBM QRadar SIEM 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID:CVE-2012-0213 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0213]

Description:Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of memory when processing certain Channel Definition Format (CDF)/ Compound File Binary Format (CFBF) documents. By sending a specially-crafted CDF / CFBF file to an application using Apache POI, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score:5.0
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75558 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75558]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score:*Undefined
CVSS Vector:AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P


CVE-ID:CVE-2014-3529 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3529]

Description:Apache POI could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error within the OPC SAX setup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OpenXML file containing an XML external entity declaration to read arbitrary files on the system.

CVSS Base Score:5.0
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score:*Undefined
CVSS Vector:AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N


CVE-ID:CVE-2014-3574 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3574]

Description:Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OOXML file to consume all available CPU resources and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score:4.3
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score:*Undefined
CVSS Vector:AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P


CVE-ID:CVE-2014-9527 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9527]

Description:Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted PPT file to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop and deadlock.

CVSS Base Score:5.0
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99799 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99799]for the current score

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-5000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5000]

Description:Apache POI could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when XLSX2CSV example uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an XML document containing an external entity reference to read arbitrary files on the system.

CVSS Base Score:4.3
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115530 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115530]for the current score
