 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What information should be collected when I experience a problem with Process Simulator 4.5? 

ANSWER
Must Gather for BPM 4.5 - Process Simulator 

For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). Gathering this data before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

Collecting MustGather data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if: 

 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity.


Locating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix. 

Gathering General Information For IBM® Filenet® BPM products, gather the operating system versions and settings for the pertinent server(s) and/or client machines. 

Then, gather the information specific to a Process Simulator problem or issue. 

This information is needed: 

 * How often does this problem occur? 
 * Can the problem be reproduced? 
 * How many users are affected by this problem? 
 * What is the business impact of this problem? 
 * Is there a workaround?


Gathering Operating System Versions and Settings 

These commands collect:  * OS Version 
 * OS Environment Variables 
 * OS Kernel parameters


Run the following commands on the PS Server and collect the output: 

Windows users Command Collects 
systeminfo winmsd 
(and do a file -> “export” menu choice to create a text file)

OS Version, Patches and Maintenance level set OS Environment Variable cscript C:\windows\system32\eventquery.vbs /L application /R 1000 /V 

cscript C:\windows\system32\eventquery.vbs /L system /R 1000 /V 

cscript C:\windows\system32\eventquery.vbs /L security /R 1000 /V OS Event Log Error Reporting 

Gathering Process Simulator Specific Information 
Process Simulator Server Version information 

Open ps.jar in PS installation’s cvsim directory and the version information is in the file called ps-ver.properties. 


PS Server 

Always gather properties.txt file in PS installation cvsim directory and submit it. 

Enable the appropriate java trace options in the fnlog4j.properties file. Put that fnlog4j.properties file in the appropriate PS’s Java JRE LIB folder. Create your own fnlog4j.properties by copying one from the PE’s \fnsw_loc\sd\fnlog4j.properties.sample file for a starting point. 

Replicate the problem. 

Submit the java trace file. 


What to do next 

Once you have collected the preceding information, you can begin analyzing the data or simply submit the diagnostic information to IBM support.
