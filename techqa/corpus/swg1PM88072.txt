ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Generate against an element in a model-centric project when
   performing code generation. After CG, continue to call RoundTrip
   against the element, error 'dont-care-loc *** unable to open
   source file ............cpp, return code = 1' is reported by the
   tool.

   ****************************************************************
   If the model is not Code Centric and the property
   'CPP_CG::File::Generate' of a package or a class is set to
   the value 'Specification', only a specification file is
   generated for the element. In the roundtrip an
   implementation file is expected and therefore error is
   reported.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the property 'CPP_CG::File::Generate' is set to the
   value 'Specification', the implementation file will not be
   generated. However if the model is not Code Centric in the
   roundtrip process the implementation file is expected to be
   there. It is a user's responsibility to add the
   implementation file. The workaround can be to generate the
   file once and then to change the value of the property
   'CPP_CG::File::Generate' to 'Specification'.
