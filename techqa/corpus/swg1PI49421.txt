APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You compute the same mean (e.g. '6.5500000') using FREQUENCIES,
   DESCRIPTIVES, and CTABLES command syntax in SPSS Statistics 23.0
   and 23,.0 FP2.  The resulting pivot tables correctly display the
   mean value.  However, when you edit these tables and change the
   display format for this value to one with only a single decimal
   place, the FREQUENCIES table is the only one to correctly
   display the rounded value  ('6.6')  The others merely truncate
   and show '6.5'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please
   refer to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   
   In this case, the Frequencies procedure calculates the mean
   slightly differently than CTABLES or DESCRIPTIVES.
   
   Both CTABLES and DESCRIPTIVES calculate it ending in "89", where
   FREQUENCIES calculates it ending in "98".
   
   6.5499999999999989
   6.5499999999999998
   
   These get rounded to 15 decimal places internally, giving:
   
   6.5499999999999990
   6.5500000000000000
   
   Which when rounded to 1 decimal place give:
   
   6.5
   6.6
