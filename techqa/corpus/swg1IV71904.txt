ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   Several attributes in the Linux Process attribute group are
   expressed in number of pages and there are no equivalent
   attributes expressed in Megabytes. This way it is not possible
   to define a unique situation whose threshold is valid for all
   the Linux managed systems, as the page  size can differ from
   server to server. These attributes are related to  real memory
   utilization and specifically: Resident Set Size (Pages),
   Shared Memory (Pages), Text Resident Set (Pages), Shared Lib
   Resident Set (Pages), Data Resident Set (Pages).
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This limitation applies to all the Linux OS agent versions and
   does not depend on the Linux flavor or version.
   
   Diagnostics: n/a
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium, cannot define situations to alert on real memory usage
   by processes that can be distributed to all Linux servers
   regardless of their defined page size

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Cannot properly monitor the following memory utilization by
   Linux processes as they are reported as number of pages:
   Resident Set Size (Pages), Shared Memory (Pages), Text Resident
   Set (Pages), Shared Lib Resident Set (Pages), Data Resident Set
   (Pages) and Total Size (Pages).
   
   Since the size of pages is configurable at the Linux operating
   system level, and it can largely vary from server to server,
   these metrics cannot be used to monitor the actual memory
   footprint of processes, and situations defined on these
   attributes can trigger in inconsistent ways from server to
   server.
   
   The fix for this APAR is to add six new attributes expressed in
   MegaBytes to the Linux Process attribute group.  See the APAR
   Conclusion for more details of the new attributes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Six new attributes added to the Linux Process attribute group:
   
   1. Total Size (MB)
      Total memory size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
   
   2. Resident Set Size (MB)
      Resident set size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
   
   3. Shared Memory (MB)
      Shared (mmap'd) memory size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
   
   4. Text Resident Set (MB)
      Text resident set size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
   
   5. Shared Lib Resident Set (MB)
      Shared lib resident set size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
   
   6. Data Resident Set (MB)
      Data resident set size in megabytes.
      Note: The following values are valid: integers. The value -2
        indicates Not Collected, 9223372036854775807 indicates
        Value Exceeds Maximum.
