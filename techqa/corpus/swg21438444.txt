IBMSCORE IBM_SCORE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The readme for IBM Solution for Compliance in a Regulated Environment (IBM SCORE) 6.1.1 fix pack 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 has steps to clean up WebSphere and repository caches and temporary files. This technote provides expanded steps on how to clean up these caches in an existing IBM SCORE system. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clearing WebSphere server caches and temporary files 

Delete all files in the following directories and restart the server:

profile_root/wstemp
profile_root/temp
profile_root/logs
profile_root/tranlog 

Where profile_root is the directory structure for WebSphere. 

Restart the server. 

 

Clearing Documentum caches

For Documentum 5.3 

In the Portal directory structure on the Portal and Process servers, delete all the folders (and contents) under the dmcl directory. 

Restart the servers. 

 

For Documentum 6.5 & 6.7 

On the Portal and Process servers, delete all the folders (and contents) under documentum_dir/cache. 

Restart the servers. 

 

Clearing IBM Content Manager caches 

IBM Content Manager caches are cleared by restarting the Portal , Process , and Content Manager servers. 

 

Clearing SCORE JavaServer Pages (JSP) cache 

Find the directory similar to the following (portions in italic are installation dependent):

Windows:
drive letter :\WAS\wp_profile\temp\SCOREPortalNode\WebSphere_Portal\Score\SCOREUI.war\WEB-INF 

Unix: 
/WAS/wp_profile/temp/SCOREPortalNode/WebSphere_Portal/Score/SCOREUI.war/WEB-INF 

 

Delete the WEB-INF directory and all its children directories. 

These are cached copies and are recreated automatically by the server as needed. The directories can be deleted even if the server is running.
