CAUSE
Group DFHISCIP in missing from your CICS region. The CICS-supplied group DFHISCIP was introduced in CICS TS V3.2 and contains the default autoinstall user program for IPIC connections, DFHISAIP.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the DFHCSDUP UPGRADE command [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha6/topics/dfha6ax.html] to upgrade your existing DFHCSD or Create a new DFHCSD [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha2/topics/dfha2_set_sysdef_dataset.html] that when initialized will include group DFHISCIP.

DFHISCIP is included in the default CICS startup grouplist DFHLIST. If you use a different CICS startup grouplist, ensure that you append the DFHISCIP group to it.
