APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RSHD daemon does not handle the EXIT=NOEXIT parameter correctly.
   The code in process_options does not parse for an exit name of
   NOEXIT which causes NOEXIT to be treated as an exit name.  The
   daemon will try to load NOEXIT and msgCSV003I will be issued
   indicating that NOEXIT could not be loaded.
   The RSHD proc and the copy of the proc printed in SC31-7134-02
   Customerization and Administration Guide contain comments that
   indicate EXIT=NOEXIT can be specified when no exit is required.
   
   KEYWORDS:  RSHD31 RXSERVE
   CSV003I REQUESTED MODULE NOEXIT NOT FOUND
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Specifying EXIT= with no exit name on the EXEC statement or with
   NOEXIT as a parameter will cause the daemon to run without an
   exit.
   Specifying EXIT= with no exit name or NOEXIT on the MVS modify
   command will cause the daemon to unload the currently loaded
   exit and continue processing without an exit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of TCP/IP for MVS; REXECD          *

   The Remote Execution Cataloged Procedure (RXPROC) in "Step 3:
   Update the Remote Execution Cataloged Procedure" in Chapter 12.
   "Configuring the Remote Execution Server" on page 418 of the
   TCP/IP for MVS Version 3 Release 1 Customization and
   Administration Guide (SC31-7134-02) states that EXIT=NOEXIT can
   be specified when no exit is required.
   
   If EXIT=NOEXIT is specified, msgCSV003I REQUESTED MODULE NOEXIT
   can be issued. Coding EXIT=, or issuing a MODIFY , EXIT=NOEXIT
   works as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Remote Execution Cataloged Procedure (RXPROC) in "Step 3:
   Update the Remote Execution Cataloged Procedure" in Chapter 12.
   "Configuring the Remote Execution Server" on page 418 of the
   TCP/IP for MVS Version 3 Release 1 Customization and
   Administration Guide (SC31-7134-02) should be changed as
   follows:
   
     //*     Supported PARMS (separated by commas - ',') are:
     //*      EXIT=exitmod - Name of an exit routine to alter JOB
     //*                     and EXEC parameters for submission of
     //*                     TSO batch job submitted for remote
     //*                     commands. EXIT=, can be specified when
     //*                     no exit is required.
