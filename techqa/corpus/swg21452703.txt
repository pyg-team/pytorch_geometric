Title: IBM Port error on Situation Update Forwarder (SUF) process startup - United States

Text:
ITM; 5724C04MS; SUF; failure; socket; connection; NoRouteToHostException; The socket name is not available on this system TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Using the standard port for the SUF, how can the error "<Exception><!¬CDATA¬java.net.NoRouteToHostException: The socket name is not available on this system" happen? 

CAUSE
The SUF will use the port number contained in the 'cms_port' slot of the last event that was trying to be sent. It will first try this port as SSL (HTTPS) and failover to non-SSL (HTTP)

ANSWER
If the port has been changed on the TEMS and there are old events in the ../persistence/situpdate* file then the port in those events will try to be used. The events need to be cleared from the ../persistence/situpdate* file and then the next event will have the correct port and the SUF will reconnect and send the events.
