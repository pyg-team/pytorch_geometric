APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JSC 1.3 + FP05
   
   Replication Steps/Example:
   
   paulk2821 - Master
   paulk2823 - Domain Manager
   paulk2824 - FTA in Domain
   
   In the JSC 1.3 (any fixpack) in the Workstation Plan you will
   see
   the FTA of sub-domain showing as Writer not running by
   displaying a red
   " 'X' No "  even if it is running.
   
   
   Using: conman @!@

   UKDOMAIN
   
   
   conman does not know about writer either, but instead just
   displays a empty/blank ' ', where the W should appear.
   This is
   product design and cannot be easily changed.
   
   However, customer asks that we leave 'empty/blank' in JSC also
   if this
   is the case.
   
   ---------------------------------
   
   The JSC is showing a 'X No' for Writer on Extended Agent.
   As XA does not have Writer (just its host) this again should be
   ' '
   
   i.e conman correctly shows
   
   # Extended Agents
   
   > conman sc
   
   BW_R3BATCH 376   OTHR X-AGENT LXI JX  r3batch MASTERDM
   SAP        376   OTHR X-AGENT LXI JX  r3batch MASTERDM
   SAPXA822   376   OTHR X-AGENT LHI JH  r3batch MASTERDM
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  CC should use a monitoring solution to ensure workstations are
   running.
   
   Also a filter can be used to only show Workstations in that
   Domain if the naming convention is correct.
   
   A connector could be installed on each DM
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is related to a different behaviour from the JSC and
   the CLI. The JSC column named Writer Running contains the red X
   and the value "No" in two different scenarios:
   1) Master and FTA are directly linked and the Writer is not
   running;
   2) Master and FTA are linked through a Domain Manager and so
   there is not a specific Writer up and running on the Master for
   the FTA.
   The CLI shows "W" if there is a Writer up and running, nothing
   in all the other cases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We have modified the JSC behaviour to be similar to the CLI and
   so the Writer Running column will display the "Yes" value when
   the CLI will show the "W"; in all the other cases this column
   will display a blank value.
   This APAR will be fixed into JSC 1.3.0 fix pack 6, equivalent to
   PTF U800516.
