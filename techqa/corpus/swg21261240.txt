QUESTION
 How does the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server support policy change affect support for Rational® products? 

ANSWER
 

IBM will now provide standard support for 5 years with an optional purchasable extension of service for 3 additional years for the following WebSphere products, starting with version 6.0:


 * WebSphere Application Server
   
 * WebSphere Application Server - Express
   
 * WebSphere Application Server for z/OS 
   
 * Runtimes for Java Technology 



Refer to IBM WebSphere technote 1256700: 
Support Policy Change: Announcing the new "5 plus 3" support policy [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=1045&uid=swg21256700] 


Q: With the WebSphere Application Server support policy change to "5 plus 3", how does this affect the support policy on Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD)? 
A: While the WebSphere Application Server support policy has changed, that policy and the entire IBM Software Group support lifecycle policy summary can be found at the lifecycle page: 
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/ [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/] 
There you will find general policy guidelines in addition to product-specific support policies. 

RAD v7.x adheres to the same enhanced support policy as WAS 6.x. The lifecycle page does reflect this now. RAD v7.0 is tagged as having enhanced (E) support. RAD v7.x follows the Enhanced SW support policy of 5 years with an optional purchasable extension of service for 3 additional years, "5 plus 3". 

Additionally, it should be noted that RAD can deploy and support applications to 3 versions of WebSphere Application Server. RAD has always recognized the need to support WebSphere Application Server for longer lifecycles, therefore our versions of Rational Application Developer can deploy and support applications to three versions of WAS, referred to as (N - 2) support. For example, RAD 7.0 supports deployments to WAS 6.1, 6.0 and 5.1. This allows users to upgrade tools more rapidly than upgrading the runtime, benefiting from new technology and updated open standards support, without having to upgrade their production WAS environments all at once.
