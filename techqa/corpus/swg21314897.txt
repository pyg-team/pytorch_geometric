PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to install WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender for Integration Server version 8.2.0.x, to a server on which WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus has already been successfully installed, the Integration Server install fails with a "Setup has detected that you are trying to install a product that requires an IBM WebSphere Integration Server as a prerequisite." error message 

CAUSE
The WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers install process cannot locate a keyword in the .nifregistry file

ENVIRONMENT
During the installation of WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers v8.2.0.x

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
An error message, "Setup has detected that you are trying to install a product that requires an IBM WebSphere Integration Server as a prerequisite." will be displayed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following steps can be taken to edit the .nifregistry file to resolve this installation issue: 

Operating System root installed .nifregistry location Windows %SystemRoot% AIX /usr/.ibm/.nif Solaris, Linux, HP-UX /opt/.ibm/.nif Operating System non-root installed .nifregistry location AIX, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX ~/.nif 

1) Open the .nifregistry file with a file editor of your choice. The .nifregistry file is located in the directory depicted in the table listed above. 


2) Look for a line similar to the following that contains "WebSphere/ESB/": 

<product installrooturi=" file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphere/ESB/ [file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphere/ESB/]" 
lastvisited="2008-07-16 14:17:00-0400" productid="ND" version="6.1.0.17"/> 


3) Change the productid to be WBI. 


4) After editing the .nifregistry file, the line should now look like: 
<product installrooturi=" file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphere/ESB/ [file:///C:/Program%20Files/IBM/WebSphere/ESB/]" 
lastvisited="2008-07-16 14:17:00-0400" productid="WBI" version="6.1.0.17"/> 

Your version of WBI may be different, but as long as it is a 6.1.0.x release, it is relative to this Technote. 


5) Install the WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Server software. 


6) After the install is complete, restore the productid to "ND" in the .nifregistry file. 


The .nifregistry file may have slightly different values in it, the key is to modify just the productid.
