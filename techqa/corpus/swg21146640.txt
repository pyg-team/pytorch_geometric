QUESTION
How can you create a new connection to a database set in IBM Rational ClearQuest for UNIX or Linux based platforms?

ANSWER
You can set up a new connection to a ClearQuest schema repository with any of these methods: 

 1. ClearQuest 7.x uses the Eclipse RCP Client, which allows for the creation and managing of database connections with a GUI interface. Access this through the File > Database > Manage Connection menu option. 
 2. In ClearQuest 2003 versions, with the ClearQuest UNIX client login window you will see a box in the right hand side with an ellipse "..." on it. When you click on that, you will see a menu with "Add Dbset" on it. You can proceed from there giving the vendor connection details. 
 3. You can use the command line utility cqreg add_dbset. You can find more information and examples of this command in technote 1320850 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21320850].
