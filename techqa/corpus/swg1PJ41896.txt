APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Process Engine, the audited datetime tuype property value
   is not returned as expected.
   - Create case that includes datetime type property
   - Audit this property
   - Add new case using Case Manager
   - Update datetype property using Properties widget (I updated
   with time of 1PM). Note that Property widget is not related to
   history feature
   - Close case detail page, reopen and make sure that Properties
   widget shows 1PM
   - In Case History Visualizer widget click on last event and look
   up detail of that event
   - Detail shows 9AM time instead of expected 1PM.
   
   Client side debugging reveals that call to REST API returned ISO
   string for that property "2013-09-14T15:00:00.000Z". Client
   interprets it as UTC time and applies time zone which results in
   UI that shows 9AM.
   This value is incorrect I'd expect it to be
   "2013-09-14T19:00:00.000Z", then application of timezone would
   gain correct UI and that UI would correspond that of Properties
   widget.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers using 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002 and prior using Case     *
   * History in a localized environment (client and server are in *
   * different time zones).                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Limitation: The fix can only address new Case History        *
   * records. It does not fix up existing records since the time  *
   * was persisted incorrectly in the server locale instead of    *
   * GMT.                                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003 or later.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003 and later will resolve this  problem.
