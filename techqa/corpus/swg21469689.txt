 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Last updated on March 2, 2011.

This Security Alert addresses a serious security vulnerability (CVE-2010-4476) that can cause the Java Virtual Machine to enter an infinite loop. This issue is described in more detail at http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476]. 

CONTENT
Products Affected 

The issue exists in the Java class libraries and affects server products that use Java. IBM SPSS server products that use Java include: 

 * Statistics products:
   □ SPSS Statistics Server versions 19, 18 
 * Modeling & Text Mining products:
   □ SPSS Modeler Server versions 14.1, 14, 13
   □ SPSS Text Analytics Server versions 14.1, 14, 13 
   
 * Collaboration and Deployment Services products:
   □ SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services versions 4.2, 4.1, 4.0
   □ SPSS Predictive Enterprise Services versions 3.5
   
 * Decision Management products:
   □ SPSS Decision Management versions 6.1, 6.0
   □ SPSS Event Builder versions 5.0
   □ SPSS Risk Control Builder versions 5.x
   □ SPSS Interaction Builder versions 5.x 
   
 * ShowCase products:
   □ SPSS ShowCase versions 9.0, 8.0
   □ Oracle Hyperion Enterprise Performance Management 11.1



Description 
This vulnerability can cause the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to hang, enter an infinite loop, or crash when converting "2.2250738585072012e-308" to a binary floating-point number. The result can be a denial of service exposure in server products. This same problem can occur if the number is written without scientific notation (that is, using all of the 324 decimal places). This vulnerability can affect any Java program that uses the Double.parseDouble method.

Solution
To prevent this vulnerability from affecting your server product, you must apply a patch to your existing Java version or install a Java version that includes the fix.

No action is necessary if you do not require the fix.

Customer Supplied Java 

Below is a list of SPSS products that do not include a JRE runtime as part of the product. The JRE used with these SPSS products is a separately installed component that is available from the operating system, application server, or Java vendor. 

 * Collaboration and Deployment Services products:
   □ SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Server
   □ SPSS Predictive Enterprise Services 
 * Decision Management products:
   □ SPSS Decision Management
   □ SPSS Event Builder
   □ SPSS Risk Control Builder 
   □ SPSS Interaction Builder 
   
 * ShowCase products:
   □ SPSS ShowCase Server
   □ Oracle Hyperion Enterprise Performance Management on IBM i



For the products above, to resolve the security vulnerability, you will need to patch or upgrade the JRE to a version that is recommended by the Operating System, Application Server or Java vendor. 

The following table provides links to vendor-supplied details and solutions for this vulnerability: IBM http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/cve-2010-4476.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/cve-2010-4476.html] HP https://h20392.www2.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=HPUXFPUPDATER [https://h20392.www2.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=HPUXFPUPDATER] Oracle http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2010-4476-305811.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2010-4476-305811.html] 
Before you update your JRE on a production system, it is strongly recommended that you: 
• Apply the patch in a test environment to verify that your product is working correctly 
• Make a backup before you apply any changes 

SPSS-provided Java 
The products listed below do include a JRE as part of the product installation.  * Statistics products:
   □ SPSS Statistics Server 
 * Modeling & Text Mining products:
   □ SPSS Modeler Server 
   □ SPSS Modeler Adapters for Collaboration and Deployment Services 
   □ SPSS Text Analytics Server 
   □ SPSS Text Mining Adapters for Collaboration and Deployment Services 
 * ShowCase products:
   □ ShowCase Enterprise Server
   □ Oracle Hyperion Enterprise Performance Management on Microsoft Windows


You can also manually apply the patch to your JRE using the following steps. 


Determine which version of JRE you are using 

 * 
 * spss_location_jre
 * 
 * spss_location_jre
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * java -version
   

The resulting message will indicate whether you have an IBM or Sun version of JRE.
