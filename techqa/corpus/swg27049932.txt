Important notes


 * Depending on the version of IBM BPM version you are upgrading from, you must also look at earlier post-upgrade tasks:

 *  Post-installation tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6 CF02 and V8.5.6 CF01 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047155] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047585] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2016.09 and CF2016.06 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048418] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2016.12 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049143] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2017.03 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049396]
   
   For example, if you are upgrading from IBM BPM V8.5.6 CF02, also look at the Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047585], the Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2016.09 and CF2016.06 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048418], the Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2016.12 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049143], and the Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2017.03 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049396].
   
 * After IBM Process Center is successfully upgraded, update your process applications to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels so you can integrate the latest improvements and defect fixes associate with the toolkit objects. After you update to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels, you might notice small behavior changes in your process application, such as to the user interfaces, which you might need to modify.
   
 * Installing cumulative fixes can modify the existing system toolkits for the associated version. If your applications are associated with the latest system toolkits, they will automatically include the changes.
