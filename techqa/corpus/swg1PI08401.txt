APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Liberty Profile (V8.5.5.1) customer is running into issue
   where Liberty does not find the HandlerChain.xml file.
   
   The customer application is packaged as an .ear file with a lib
   folder and multiple .war files. When customer starts the
   Liberty server they get the errors below.
   
   Errors seen from console:
   
   [ERROR   ] CWWKZ0106E: Could not start web application
   <APPLICATION_NAME>.
   [ERROR   ] CWWKZ0002E: An exception occurred while starting the
   application <APPLICATION_NAME>. The exception message was:
   com.ibm.ws.container.service.metadata.MetaDataException:
   javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException:
   CWWKW0032E: The handler chain
   file cannot be parsed because of exception JAR entry
   <XML_PATH>/HandlerChain.xml not found in <FILESYSTEM_PATH>.
   <JAR_PATH>.
   
   Error seen in the FFDC log file:
   
   Exception = java.io.FileNotFoundException
   Source =com.ibm.ws.jaxws.metadata.builder.
   HandlerChainInfoBuilder
   probeid = 373
   Stack Dump = java.io.FileNotFoundException: JAR entry
   <XML_PATH>/HandlerChain.xml not found in <FILESYSTEM_PATH>.
   <JAR_PATH>
   ...
   ...
   Dump of objectArray[0]
   Object type = java.lang.String
   String value = "<APPLICATION_METHOD>"
   
   Dump of objectArray[1]
   Object type = java.lang.String
   String value = "HandlerChain.xml"
   
   It appears that the problem is that the package path is also in
   a jar file that is in the .ear's lib folder.  The customer sees
   that Liberty finds the package path in the application jar first
   and expects the HandlerChain.xml file to be there. Since it is
   not there,  Liberty throws an error instead of continuing to
   search additional jars in the classpath.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  L3 developers added the two classes, that have a fix, into
   com.ibm.ws.jaxws.common_1.0.jar (under wlp/lib) so Liberty
   WILL find the HandlerChain.xml in the correct location, and the
   customer application WILL deploy successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This issue will affect IBM WebSphere        *
   *                  Application Server Liberty Profile users    *
   *                  under the following conditions:             *
   *                  - use a web service application             *
   *                  - have a handler chain configuration file   *
   *                  associated with a service class             *
   *                  - the same package name of the given        *
   *                  service class exists in more than one Java  *
   *                  EE Jar/War file                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Liberty Profile does not find the web   *
   *                      service application's                   *
   *                      handlerchain.xml file                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The handler chain configuration file is associated with one
   given class. Previously the logic was to get the java package
   name from the class name, and then search the package name to
   locate the folder. However, the same java package could exist
   in more than one jar archive, in such case it could find the
   wrong path.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The new logic is to search where the java class file is, but
   not the package name since we just want to locate the handler
   chain configuration file from the same path of the given class
   which it is associated with.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.2. Please refer to the Recommended Updates page
