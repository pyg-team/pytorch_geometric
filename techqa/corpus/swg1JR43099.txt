APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you design a UCA for repeated execution, you might experience
   the case that the first execution happens on the defined time,
   while all subsequent executions are moved by one or more hours.
   This situation can happen, if the Process Server and the
   Database are running on different time zones. This fix solves
   this situation so that the UCA execution takes place always on
   the scheduled Process Server time.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Time-elapsed UCA are rescheduled incorrectly if Process Server
   and Database
   are in different time zones.
   
   If you design a UCA for repeated execution, you might experience
   the case
   that the first execution happens on the defined time,
   while all subsequent executions are moved by one or more hours.
   This situation can happen, if the Process Server and the
   Database
   are running on different time zones. This fix solves this
   situation
   so that the UCA execution takes place always on the scheduled
   Process Server time.
   Hint: if the Process Server runs on Linux, the UCA's schedules
   are meant
   without daylight savings time.

   ng_undercover_agents_B.html
   describes how to define an UnderCover Agent for a scheduled
   event.
   In bullet 10, the sample shows how to define the schedule to
   fire at midnight.
   The time specification "midnight" is interpreted as the point in
   time, where the process server machine's clock reaches 24:00
   local time.
   This means, that the local timezone setting of the process
   server machine is used.
   
   In case of clustered process servers, the process servers must
   be set to the same time zone, and their clocks should be
   synchronized.
   For scheduled Undercover Agents, the clocks' times must not
   differ for more than 2.5 minutes.
   
   The process server's databases may reside on a remote machine,
   and this machine may have different timezone and time setting.
   
   Changes to timezone or time setting on process server or
   database machines may cause already scheduled Undercover Agents
   to run at an unexpected time. However, all subsequent executions
   of the Undercover Agents are performed according to the
   specification,
   interpreted as usual: according to the current time zone and
   time setting of the systems.
