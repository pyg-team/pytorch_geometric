Title: IBM Configuring Decision Center and Rule Execution Server database schemas in the stand-alone server installation - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I configure the Decision Center and Rule Execution Server database schemas of the stand-alone server launchpad install option? 

ANSWER
The stand-alone server option of the Operational Decision Manager (ODM) launchpad offers to setup a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) instance with the Java EE modules deployed. With this option, you can also specify the database provider for the deployed modules. 

The configuration is setup for one single user who can connect to the WAS administrative console, and all the ODM consoles and modules (Event Runtime, Decision Center and Rule Execution Server). 

This configuration uses a single database instance/schema that is shared. 

 

Note: In V8.0.0, the launchpad step to select the database properties mistakenly indicates that the database setup is only for the "Event repository". The definition is actually used for all three modules: they all share the same database schema. This misleading UI issue is fixed in V8.0.1.
