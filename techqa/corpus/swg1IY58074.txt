ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Webseal with TAM/AWS 4.1-0011LA on W2K has memory leak issue.
   Received email from Chris C (GC lab engineer) who was on site.
   
   "During the test I've noticed that the memory usage of WebSEAL
   was increasing by 4 - 8 KB per second. We were doing about 20 -
   30 transactions per sec.
   
   In the production system, I've noticed that the WebSEAL's memory
   usage has grown to close to 700MB over approximately 4 - 5 hour
   period.
   
   The leak was observed in a system with FP11 + an interim fix
   released by L3 (as per PMR). I did not get chance to test the
   leak with just FP11. However, they said that they observed
   similar leak when they ran same test with FP11 prior to my
   arrival onsite.
   
   Also the customer was reluctant to do further testing with FP11
   because of constant crashes. In the limited tests that we were
   able to do, we established that the crash would occur only when
   io-buffer-size was changed. These crashes weren't due to memory
   exhaustion. The io-buffer-size that they tried were 64KB, 124KB
   and 256 KB. They wanted to test the performance at various
   io-buffer-size because of an earlier recommendation from IBM
   support. FP9 would not crash when same values were used for
   io-buffer-size.
   
   I did ping HK again about running another test just with FP11
   but he says that it's unlikely that the customer will be willing
   to do so now that they have a stable system."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   This issue has been unreproducible in both the
   L2 and L3 lab environment.  To continue further analysis, we wil
   l need system_status, senddata, and core files.
