APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SAML SP-initiated Web SSO requires that an Identity Provider
   server send its SAMLResponse back to the entity which initially
   solicited it via a SAMLRequest.
   
   In a cluster environment, if you are unable to use session
   affinity or dynacache, SP-initiated SAML Web SSO will not work.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  enable dynacache or session affinity in the environment
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server and SAML Web SSO                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SAML SP-initiated Web SSO may not       *
   *                      work properly in a cluster environment  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  Install a fix pack that contains this       *
   *                  APAR.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   Since SAML SP-initiated Web Single Sign-on (SSO) depends on
   the SAMLResponse from the identity provider (IdP) being sent
   back to the same server that sent the SAMLRequest, it may not
   work properly in a cluster environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SAML SP-initiated Web SSO requires that an Identity Provider
   server send its SAMLResponse back to the entity which initially
   solicited it via a SAMLRequest. In a cluster environment,
   when the IdP sends the SAMLResponse, without session
   affinitiy, the individual cluster member that receives the
   response is indeterminate. If the cluster member  that
   receives the response is not the member that sent the
   SAMLRequest, the login process will fail.
   
   The SAML Web SSO TAI is updated so that, in a Network
   Deployment environment, when one cluster member sends a
   SAMLRequest to an IdP, any cluster member can process the
   SAMLResponse and complete the login request.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 7.0.0.43, 8.0.0.13, and 8.5.5.10.  Please refer to
