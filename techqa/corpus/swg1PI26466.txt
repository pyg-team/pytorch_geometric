APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Errors prevent installation of Rational Developer for System z
   (RDz) 9.1 and Data Studio 4.1.1 on Windows in the same package
   group. During the install using the IBM Installation Manager,
   the following error messages would occur and installing RDZ 9.1
   in the same package group as Data Studio 4.1.1 is not allowed:
   
   CRIMA1161E: Failed to find required installation files.
   CRIMC1020E: feature
   com.ibm.datatools.base.linux_2.1.200.v20131217_2357 not found
   CRIMC1020E: feature
   com.ibm.datatools.base.linux64_1.0.0.v20131217_2357 not found
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1)Install Data Studio version 4.1.0.1 instead of 4.1.1 with RDz
   9.1.
   2) Download Data Studio 4.1.1 for Linux
   (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037681),
   unzip and add the following to the IBM Installation Manager
   repository before attempting to install Data Studio 4.1.1 and
   RDz 9.1 in the same install package group:
   <DS411_Linux_unzipped folder>\disk1\diskTag.inf
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Windows and Linux only features were always being installed
   instead of installing based on the operating system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Windows and Linux specific features were not being installed
   based on the operating system.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
