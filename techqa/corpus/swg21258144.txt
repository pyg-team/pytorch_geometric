Signal 24 or SIGXCPU is sent to the Java™ installation process when the CPU time limit is exceeded. The default action of this signal is to terminate the process, which produces a javacore. 

The same type of message might be experienced when a downloaded WebSphere Application Server product was unzipped using gunzip. An error "CPU time limit exceeded" might be displayed. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The CPU limit can be configured with the ulimit command. To resolve these issues, set the ulimit's CPU Time parameter for the user ID you are using to install with to -1. Use "smitty users" to make this change. 


Use the following version 8.5 Knowledge Center link for a complete list of directions to make the change, Tuning AIX Systems [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tprf_tuneaix.html]. The instructions are listed under the topic, AIX file descriptors (ulimit)

Reboot your machine and retry the installation. If you are unzipping, then retry the gunzip program on the downloaded image.
