ABSTRACT
 A warning message appears stating "Plug-in XXX ignored due to invalid ID" 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
PK69294 resolves the following problem:

ERROR DESCRIPTION:? 
CWX messages displayed in SystemOut.log during WebSphere® Portal 6.1 startup: 

CWXRS0004E: Failed to resolve plug-in 
CWXRS0013W: Plug-in null ignored 
"org.eclipse.core.resources.resourceMappingAdapters" due to 
invalid ID 

Portal startup is not affected. Portal functionality is not affected. Messages do not indicate any real error and should be suppressed. 

LOCAL FIX:? 
Local Fix/Work Around is to ignore the messages. No real problem has occurred; the messages should be suppressed. 

PROBLEM SUMMARY:?

USERS AFFECTED:
All users of IBM® WebSphere Application Server V6.1

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
A warning message appears stating "Plug-in XXX ignored due to invalid ID"

RECOMMENDATION:
None

The extension app registry looks for plugin.xml files in multiple locations to load at server startup. Not all
plugins.xml files are intended for consumption by the extension application registry and sometimes aren't in a format that the extension app registry can handle. In such cases, a warning message is displayed even though it's unlikely that you can do anything to avoid the message.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION:? 
The warning message will now only appear when tracing is enabled for the extension application registry. 

The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix pack 6.1.0.21.
