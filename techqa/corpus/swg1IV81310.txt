ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description
   Sometimes discovery hangs when several parallel SSH connections
   are created to the same target running OpenSSH 6.8, or newer.
   The problem is related to the fact that OpenSSH server can send
   MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST before TADDM client sends MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN.
   The problem does not occur on older OpenSSH versions. It also
   does not occur when SSH connections are created sequentially.
