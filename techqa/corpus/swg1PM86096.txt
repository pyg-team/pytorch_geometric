APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  InfoSphere CDC for z/OS was designed to allow multiple copies to
   be started using the same meta-data.  The first copy would be
   the active instance.  The second and subsequent copies would be
   "hot standby" instances.  A hot standby instance would
   initialize, but not process any subscriptions until the active
   instance had ended.  Then a hot standby instance would become
   the active instance and any other hot standby instances would
   remain so.  Coupled with the subscription persistency feature,
   this would provide almost immediate fail-over for subscriptions.
   
   The hot standby capability is not functional, the hot standby
   instances become dormant when they detect an active instance,
   but do not promote one of their members to active state when the
   current active instance ends.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users IIDR CDC for DB2 for z/OS who need to  *
   *                 implement an automated FailOver capability.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The FailOver capability of IIDR CDC for *
   *                      DB2 for z/OS is not implemented as it   *
   *                      was designed.  A second instance that   *
   *                      is using the same meta-data becomes     *
   *                      dormant, but does not become active     *
   *                      after the first instance using the      *
   *                      meta-data, or the system on which it is *
   *                      executing, fails.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   
   The FailOver capability in IIDR CDC for DB2 for z/OS is not
   functioning as it was designed to do.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Logic to implement serialization of access to the meta-data has
   been extended to issue messages indicating the state of the
   access by the instance, to accept and process a new keyword on
   the SHUTDOWN command, and to detect the loss of the instance
   that was actively using the meta-data, and act upon it.
