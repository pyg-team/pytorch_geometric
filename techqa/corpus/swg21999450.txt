QUESTION
 How can you determine which PAM signature corresponds to a particular issue ID on QRadar Network Security (XGS)? 

ANSWER
There can be times when you need to find which signature corresponds to a particular issue ID when working with the XGS appliance. An easy way to find this information is by looking IBM X-Force Exchange [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/]. Search for the issue ID in question and it returns a page with details about the signature.

An alternative method of doing this is by searching for the issue ID in the Intrusion Prevention policy. Use the following instructions to do this:


 1. Log in to the Local Management Interface (LMI) of the XGS. Alternatively, you can use the SiteProtector Console.
    
 2. In the LMI, go to Secure Policy Configuration > Intrusion Prevention Policy. In SiteProtector, go to the Policy view and open the Intrusion Prevention Policy.
    
 3. Select the IPS object that you want to view or modify.
    
 4. Under the main pane, click the Define Filter button as shown in the capture below:
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21999450&amp;aid=1]
    
 5. Use the following filter selections:
    Match: all rules
    Column: Issue ID
    Condition: Is
    Value: <issue ID>
    
 6. After clicking the Filter button, the resulting signature is displayed. Choose the Define Filter button again to change the Issue ID or use the Clear Filter option to return to the default view.
