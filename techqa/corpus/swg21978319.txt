Title: IBM Receiving custodian Confirmation for a hold notice in Atlas via Virtual Interview - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to use Virtual Interview Plan along with Hold Notice as a alternative method to In-email Notice Questionairre?. 

CAUSE
If you add variable $Q:FullyComply option in the Confirmation Instruction of the Hold Notice, then it creates the question "Have you understood and fully complied with this request?" with Yes or No Radio Buttons and Submit Response Button in the Hold notice email itself. However if you use Microsoft Outlook without Javascript support or Lotus Notes without Javascript Support, then the radio button and Submit Response will not work. 
If you want to skip $Q:FullyComply , then you have to add $emailConfirmation along with $NoticeResponseURL. for the Confirmation Instruction.

If you donot want to use $emailConfirmation either , then you have to use a Virtual Interview Plan. 


ANSWER
As an Alternative to In-Email Hold Notice response, you can create a Virtual Interview Plan with one Confirmation Type Question and add the Virtual Plan to Hold Notice. And Select $interviewurl as the only Confirmation Instruction . The custodian would be able to respond on the webpage directly instead of responding on the email
