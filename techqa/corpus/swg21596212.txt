QUESTION
 In a cluster VMWare environment where servers have been enabed to move around the cluster to use lower processor settings , ILMT 7.5 tool does not recognize this setting and uses individual VMware host for reporting PVU values. 

ANSWER
We do not interpret cluster in any way other than as a set of 

machines your PVU will be maximum a product had in given month. 
For example, if your VM with WebsphereMQ was 29 days on 
machine with 50 PVU and one day on machine with 70 PVU we will count it 
as 70 PVU. This is the way subcapacity pricing rules work.
