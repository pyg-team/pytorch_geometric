APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description: When all chances to answer challenge questions are
   exhausted, application still allows end user to submit the
   challenge response. After correctly answering challenge
   question, user is navigated to change password screen and via it
   user can reset password though account was suspended earlier due
   to invalid challenge response attempts.
   
   Steps to Duplicate: After all chances to answer challenge
   questions are exhausted, application was allowing end user to
   submit the challenge response. After correctly answering
   challenge question, user is navigated to change password screen
   and via it user can reset password. Note that account was
   suspended earlier to invalid challenge response attempts. ITIM
   API doesn't throw an exception while submitting the change
   password request.
   
   Now consider another scenario, user is already logged in custom
   application and is about to reset the password but meantime
   helpdesk or administrator locks this user's ITIM account. In
   this case, when user tries to actually submit the change
   password request ITIM throws an error 'CTGIMH055E There are no
   existing accounts for this person. The accounts may be inactive,
   or access is denied, or the account does not require a
   password.' . But similar type of exception/error is not thrown
   in forgot password scenario described above.
   
   Desired Behavior: ITIM not to allow failed Challenge Response to
   submit Password Change requests.
   
   Environment: ITIM 4.6 Fixpack 91 on AIX 5.3
