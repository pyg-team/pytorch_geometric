QUESTION
 What is changing in the Watson Explorer support experience? 

CAUSE
We are always striving to seek new and better ways to improve our communications and the support we offer. With that in mind, we’re excited to announce we’ve launched a new Support Community/Experience for a select number of IBM products, Watson Explorer being one of them.

ANSWER
Our new community will provide you enhance transparency into your ticket resolution workflow along with improved self-service options. You can see a quick video overview of the initial experience here: https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/t/1_hjcvgybl [https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/t/1_hjcvgybl] 

The move to this new support experience should be seamless for you. Specifically:
· Your bookmarks and existing access methods will automatically connect to the new Support Community once you’ve selected Watson Explorer as a product.
· The same URLs you currently use will continue to work, or you can use a new URL to reach the new Support experience directly: https://www.ibm.com/mysupport [https://www.ibm.com/mysupport]
· Any existing PMRs will be automatically converted to “Cases” in the new tool. Simply choose “cases” from the Watson Explorer support landing page to see status or make updates 

We know you may have other IBM products and those too will be migrating to this new experience over time. Please note that you may receive other communications notifying you of the plans for other IBM products. Your experience with Watson Explorer support will continue to evolve. Among other improvements, we’re incorporating IBM Watson technology, and providing a truly “one-stop shop” for Customer Support related information for Watson Explorer.

Watson Explorer now appears in the product selection area on the new Support Community. 
To access the Community: 
1) Go to www.ibm.com/mysupport [http://www.ibm.com/mysupport] , where you can select your product.
