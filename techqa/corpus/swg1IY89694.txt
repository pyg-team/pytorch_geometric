ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT:
   
   ITM 6.1 FP02 to FP03 TEP Browser
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   A user has connected to a TEPS at FP02 at some point and
   installed the Browser client. The TEPS is then upgraded to
   Fixpack 3. The user connects to the TEPS again and new Java
   code appears to be downloaded to his machine but the logon
   window never comes up and the Inetrnet Explorer just sits there
   with no messages. The user has to kill IE, clear the Java cache
   and restart IE. Then it downloads the complete set of Java
   coded and works fine.  The user objects to having to clear the
   Java cache.
   
   The problem is the candle/fw/iloglicensing/JViewsLicenseManager
   class is new in itm 61 fp3. The version of the jar did not
   change between fixpack 2 and fixpack 3, the version remained
   2.2.8.9.
   
   So if you have fp2 jars in the cache, the new util.jar in fp3
   will not be downloaded because its the same version as the one
   in the cache.
   
   So this is very east to fix so the end users don't all have to
   clear the jar cache.
   
   edit the applet.html file located in the ibm\itm\cnb directory
   and  change the version number for the util.jar file from
   2.2.8.9 to 2.2.9.0.
   
   This will signal a download for anyone who has the old version
   in the cache.
   
   RECREATION STEPS:
   
   Browser going from FP02 to FP03.

LOCAL FIX
 *  edit the applet.html file located in the ibm\itm\cnb directory
   and  change the version number for the util.jar file from
   2.2.8.9 to 2.2.9.0.
   
   This will signal a download for anyone who has the old version
   in the cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In ITM 61 fix pack 3, Util.jar does not get downloaded when the
   TEP browser client connects to the TEP server via the Java
   plugin.  In fix pack 3, the util.jar contains a new class file
   that is needed to validate the license for one of the third
   party products we use in the TEP client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The applet.html was updated to reflect a new version for
   util.jar.  This change will force the java plugin to download
   the new util.jar to the end users jar cache on their local
   machine.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle(s):
   
   | interim fix | 6.1.0.3-TIV-ITM_TEPS-IF0002
   | fix pack | 6.1.0-TIV-ITM-FP0004
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Update the applet.html file to change the version for util.jar
   from 2.2.8.8 to 2.2.8.10.  Alternatively, clear the jar cache
   on each end users desktop.
