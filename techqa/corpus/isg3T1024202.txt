Title: IBM HTTPS access to PAC portal failed through IBM HTTP server in HA configuration - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is HTTPS access not working through gateway node in PAC 9.1.5 HA configuration? "Internal error" message is displayed in browser. There are following messages in PAC log file - message.log:
"Unable to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or security settings have expired." 

CAUSE
In case of PAC 9.1.5 for Linux on Power, IBM HTTP server version 8.5.5.7 has changed security checking feature that has compatibility issue to PAC server.

ANSWER
Modify HTTP server configuration by adding "AutoSecurity="false" to plugin-cfg.xml file. This is to tell IBM HTTP Server to use regular security checking to talk to PAC server. This is the same security level as in version 8.5.5.6 and before.
