ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is a cumulative fix release and addresses APARs and internally found issues since the release of OMNIbus 8.1.0 fix pack 10. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following defect solutions are included in this release:


8.1.0-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0011
--------------------------

IV83485
The nco_aen client failed to reconnect to the ObjectServer a
second time. The nco_aen client might also fail to reconnect to
the ObjectServer after the first time it looses connection to the
ObjectServer, if the ObjectServer was only unavailable for a
brief period. These problems are now resolved.

Also, it is now possible to suppress the popups that are related
to the connection loss between the nco_aen client and the
ObjectServer. If you want to suppress the popups that are related
to the connection loss, go to the nco_aen.properties file at each
client and set the network.popup property to 0.


IV89382
When the evaluate clause of a trigger contained a 'group by'
statement, and the trigger action had a syntax error, the
ObjectServer used to crash. Now, the syntax error is correctly
reported and the ObjectServer does not crash.


IV91012
Because IDUC is not done on the aggregate ObjectServer connection
in a dual-server desktop setup, the connection might sit idle
while a desktop operator is not performing an action to use the
connection. Some firewalls reset these idle connections, so that
when the desktop operator later performs an action to use the
connection, they see a pop-up error message for the lost
connection. The fix is to silently ping the aggregate
ObjectServer connection to prevent the connection from becoming
idle.


IV91689
The limit to the number of traps that can be generated by the MIB
Manager SNMP Trap Generator, has been removed. The default limit
is '1'. Users can override the default limit with any positive
number. All the values entered in the Trap dialog are saved and
the last value entered will be presented the next time the dialog
is opened.


IV91706
Probe peer-to-peer (P2P) connections might occasionally
incorrectly time out, if the BeatThreshold property was set to 1
second. The probes now perform sub second sleeps between checking
the P2P connection, so the incorrect timeouts do not now occur.


IV93577
The updated code in this fix-pack automatically disables the
problematic DES based ciphers. Install the fix-pack and
everything works as before. No further user interaction is
necessary.

sure the "Search service repositories during installation
and updates" is checked.

OMNIbus" entry from the list of packages to find updates for.

repository in the preferences before you update. Each package must

new repository. Give the location of the extracted
OMNIbusRepository/composite directory

2. If you have installed Installation Manager using either
Administrator or Nonadministrator mode, run the update_gui
script to launch Installation Manager into the update panel
without the requirement of configuring the update repository.
3. If the script fails, or Installation Manager is installed in
Group mode, or you want to run in console mode, then you must
configure the update repository as in the Local Repository
