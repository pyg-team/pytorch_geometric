APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If using PCF command MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC to create channel
   authority records with the same channel name but in one case
   is without trailing blanks after the name and a second case with
   trailing blanks then two records are created.
   
   DISPLAY commands show the two records but other commands like
   SET ACTION(REMOVE) command treat them as one profile and it
   deletes the two profiles from the SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE but
   it leaves one in memory cache.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use trailing spaces in channel authorization records for
   channel names or userids or ip addresses.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ Version 7 Release  *
   *                 1 Modification 0.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQSC DISPLAY CHLAUTH and SET CHLAUTH    *
   *                      commands and PCF MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC  *
   *                      and MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS commands *
   *                      do not handle parameters with trailing  *
   *                      spaces properly.                        *
   *                                                              *
   *                      It can generate duplicate channel       *
   *                      authentication records.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When two SET CHLAUTH (or MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC ) commands with
   identical parameter values, but one command does not have
   trailing spaces and the other does and they are issued one after
   the other, generate duplicate channel authentication profiles
   instead of one replacing the other.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQSC DISPLAY and SET CHLAUTH commands and PCF
   MQCMD_SET_CHLAUTH_REC and MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS
   trim all trailing spaces from the values of relevant
   parameters.
