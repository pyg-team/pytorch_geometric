PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of zSecure Admin/Audit processing      *
   *                 digital certificate data in interactive      *
   *                 mode.                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: zSecure Admin/Audit performs no record  *
   *                      selection in cases where the additional *
   *                      selection criteria on the SubjectsDN    *
   *                      and/or IssuersDN fields on RA.5         *
   *                      (C2RP3R5@) panel is used and the search *
   *                      filter is not enclosed in quotes.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF provided.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   When the additional selection criteria on SubjectsDN/IssuersDN
   field(s) is used on RA.5 (C2RP3R5@) panel, the zSecure
   Admin/Audit not provide any information that the search filter
   must be enclosed in quotes in order to get the desired results.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  zSecure Admin/Audit has been modified so that the panels
   offering the selection criteria on SubjectsDN/IssuersDN fields
   (CKRP3R52/CKRP3R53) display the suggestion that the search
   filters must be enclosed in single quotes to get an exact match.
   Online help has also been updated to reflect that. Please note
