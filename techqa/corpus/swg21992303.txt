Title: IBM SSL connections not working in SKLM 2.6 with fix pack 2 applired - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to connect to SKLM from library when using SSL 

SYMPTOM
When trying to use SSL as the connection protocol to connect to SKLM from a supported storage device. That connect attempt will fail. When you run a key path diagnostic test with SSL enabled you may see a result like the following: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=1]

However, when you choose not to use SSL it passes all the test. When you check the audit log there are no SSL related error and the debug log only has messages like the following:

ALL: Ignoring Exception... The method shutdownInput() is not supported in SSLSocket


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Here are the workaround steps which should resolve the IPP over SSL issues introduced in SKLM 2.6 fix packs

Execute these commands after having installed fix packs. Make sure on Windows you do Run As Administrator on the command window.

Step-1: List available java 
Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\KLMProfile\bin\managesdk.bat -listAvailable -verbose
Linux: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/KLMProfile/bin/managesdk.sh -listAvailable -verbose
Result: As shown in screenshot below, user will find 3 java versions

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=2]

Step-2: Stop WAS server. For example:
Windows: "C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\stopServer.bat" server1 -username wasadmin -password wasadmin
Linux: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/stopServer.sh server1 -username wasadmin -password wasadmin

Step-3: Enable 1.7_32 java
Windows: "C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\managesdk.bat" -enableProfile -profileName KLMProfile -sdkname 1.7_32 -enableServers
Linux: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/managesdk.sh -enableProfile -profileName KLMProfile -sdkname 1.7_32 -enableServers
Result: Validate success message as shown in screenshot below

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992303&aid=3]

Step-4: Start WAS server. For example:
Windows: "C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\startServer.bat" server1
Linux: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/startServer.sh server1
