This page describes the minimum product levels you should have installed before opening a problem report with the WebSphere Application Server support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, we cannot test every possible configuration. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible. For additional information on available support for configurations that are not included in the following list, refer to support article WebSphere Application Server has grown and so have your requirements.
