APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If we add a reference to the model Ada_Std_Lib using menu
   'File:Add Ada Standard Libraries', the reference path to the
   model Ada_Std_Lib is hardcoded to the current installation path
   of Rhapsody (including the Rhapsody version number).
   
   e.g.
   C:\Program
   Files\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.5.3\Share\LangAda\Ada_Std_Lib\Ada_
   Std_Lib_rpy
   
   This becomes an annoying problem after each upgrade of Rhapsody,
   and uninstall of the older Rhapsody-version in which the library
   was first added. This leads to an unresolved path when opening
   the model, and I need to reset the path for the new Rhapsody
   version.
   
   A suggested solution is to change the path to use $OMROOT
   instead.

   Hi Eric
   
   Thanks for your expert advice on this. So I believe I should log
   it as a DS2 priority Defect in RTC.
   Please correct me if I am wrong.
   
   Best Regards
   Jose

   Hi Fraser,
   
   Vova spoke to me about this issue. I don't know how to fix it
   yet. I think that it should be good to log it into RTC.

   ****************************************************************
   If you select the File ? Add Ada Standard Libraries option,
   the path stored uses the full path of the current Rhapsody
   installation. As a result, after upgrading to a newer
   version of Rhapsody, the reference is unresolved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 7.5.3.1
