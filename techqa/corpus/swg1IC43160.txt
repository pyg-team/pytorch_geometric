ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RATLC00978015
   
   Originally Customer could not generate Resp vs Time
   report(u00:195MB) and it always caused Rtmanager.exe error(see
   RATLC460944). Then the customer uses utility to spit the log
   file to smaller ones(about 65MB each) and then they can generate
   the report but found TestManager does not respond when saving
   it. As per the below suggestions from Scott, I am asking the
   customer to try saving the report and leaving it for hours and
   see how things go. However, this need further
   investigating as it is problem to take hours to save a report.
   Please assist and let us know what info you need(since customer
   could not access to FTP site, we don't have u00 file at this
   moment). Thank you very much.

   I did some testing here after I sent out my email yesterday that
   suggests it can take a long time to save the Response vs. Time
   report.
   
   I was using a set of data from a 300 VT playback.  It contained
   about 127,000 datapoints and the u00 file was 17MB.  I was able
   to generate a Response vs. Time report in under a minute, but to
   save it took over an hour (!) of CPU time.  It did eventually
   save OK.
   
   I suspect that the customer was running into the same issue;
   they simply didn't wait long enough.  Given my  experience, it
   may take hours for their report to save.
   
   I don't know why saving requires so many CPU cycles; it would
   seem that saving the report shouldn't be more time consuming
   than generating it.  You may wish to create a new escalation for
   this so that it will be investigated.

   From Scott:

   Even though the customer wasn't able to get the report to save
   at all, I still suspect that they're running into the same
   fundamental problem that I observed - it takes an unreasonably
   long time to save the Response vs. Time report.  Olga Moroz has
   done some checking on this and  established the area of the
   source code that needs to be investigated.
   
   I therefore plan to create a defect for the problem so that we
   can get more development involvement.  Please create an APAR for
   this problem and let me know the APAR ID.  I'll then go ahead
   with creating the defect.  I won't have an estimate on a
   timeframe for resolution until we look more at the source code
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Smaller file like 15MB could be saved in hours but is not
   practical
