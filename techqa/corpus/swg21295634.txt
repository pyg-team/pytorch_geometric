PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to upgrade the WebSphere DataPower appliance firmware, you get the following messages: 

Error performing that action! 
Could not install firmware image. 
Loading firmware failed: Preserve user modified data failed: 
Insufficient flash space available 
System will NOT reboot. 

CAUSE
There is not enough space available on the WebSphere DataPower appliance to complete the upgrade.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you see this error message, review the Upgrade and Rollback Guide, Generation 2 Firmware sections on removing extraneous files. There are separate sections for this process depending on whether you are using the WebGUI or the CLI to perform the upgrade, so be sure to reference the correct section. Also, review the sections on reloading the firmware image. Performing these steps will allocate enough space to upgrade the firmware of your WebSphere DataPower appliance. 




In one case, cleaning up unnecessary, no longer used files from the store:///, temp:/// and local:/// directories of the appliance allowed the upgrade to complete.

The Upgrade and Rollback Guide, Generation 2 Firmware is available from the WebSphere DataPower Product Library [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html] page. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21252389] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21377654] The guide is listed as the "Firmware Upgrade Instructions (Generation 2 firmware)" and the file name is UpgradeRollback.pdf.
