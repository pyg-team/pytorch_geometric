APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IADF - PANEL ADFU008 CONTAINS A FIELD LABELED 'OTHER
   PARTITIONED DATA SET' AND ONCE A VALUE IS ENTERED IN THIS FIELD
   THERE IS NO WAY TO BLANK IT OUT.  APPEARS THAT THE NAME IS
   SAVED IN THE USER PROFILE AND RESTORED EACH TIME ADFU008 IS
   USED.  ALSO A LIST OF MEMBERS TO BE USED CANNOT BE TAILORED,
   THAT IS, THE WHOLE LIST IS USED.  VERSION 2.1 OF IADF ALLOWED
   MEMBERS TO BE SELECTED RATHER THAN USING THE WHOLE LIST.
   PANEL ADFUTIL ALLOWS SELECTION OF BATCH OR FOREGROUND FOR
   NON-ADVANCED USERS.  HOWEVER ADVANCED USERS BYPASS THIS PANEL
   AND HAVE TO TAKE DEFAULT OF BATCH.  THIS CHOICE SHOULD BE MADE
   ON ADFU008 PANEL.  ALSO ADFUTIL PANEL DOES RETAIN THE SELECTION
   FOR THE BATCH/FOREGROUND SELECTIO, EACH TIME ADFUTIL IS
   PRESENTED, 'B' APPEARS AS CHOICE.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  PANEL IADFUTIL DOES NOT ASK FOR TYPE OF EXECUTION.PANEL ADFU008
   ASKS FOR TYPE OF EXECUTION AND STORES ALL LIBRARY INFORMATION
   TYPED IN BY THE USER. CLIST ADFDBTWO NO LONGER RECEIVES
   EXECUTION TYPE FROM IADFUTIL. IT READS IT FROM PROFILE.
