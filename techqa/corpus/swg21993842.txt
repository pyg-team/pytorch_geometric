 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a potential code execution vulnerability in WebSphere Application Server. OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 22 and 26, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-5983 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5983]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code with a serialized object from untrusted sources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116468 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116468] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 
CVEID: CVE-2016-2180 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by multiple memory leaks in t1_lib.c during session renegotiation. By sending an overly large OCSP Status Request extension, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-6303 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6303]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function. By using unknown attack vectors, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2016-6306 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6306]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing message length checks when parsing certificates. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112]for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server: 

 * Liberty 
 * Version 9.0 
 * Version 8.5.5 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
To patch an existing service instance requires two steps: 

1. To update WebSphere Application Server refer to the IBM WebSphere Application Server bulletin listed below:

Security Bulletin: Code execution vulnerability in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2016-5983) [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990060].
