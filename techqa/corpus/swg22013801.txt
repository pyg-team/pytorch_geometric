Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM API Connect (CVE-2017-3738, CVE-2017-3737) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM API Connect has addressed the following vulnerabilities.

OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. 

An unspecified vulnerability in multiple Oracle products could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and high availability impact. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
