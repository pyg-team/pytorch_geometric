You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The JMS listener service will attempt to
   buffer incoming messages irregardless of overall system memory
   conditions.  This can lead to conditions where a large spike of
   incoming messages can consume all the heap available to Impact
   which in turn will cause Impact to crash.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  L3 has already coded a patch for customer that appears to solve
   the issue, however APAR needs to be opened so that they can
   complete the required process work.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Impact Users when large spike of events  *
   *                 are sent.                                    *

   Replication steps:
   
   1. Enable memory and queue monitoring of Self Monitoring
   service. 2. Make sure JMSListener is up and running. 3. Send a
   event storm >5K 4. JMS Listener reads all the events in its
   queue 5. this causes the memory usage to spike up. 6. a) Check
   the memory and queue usage using the Self Monitoring service.
   b) alternatively check the logs for the JMS Listener service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 4.0.2-TIV-NCI-IF0001.
