 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Customer received the error below when running the License Authorization Wizard to enter the IBM SPSS Statistics Authorization code:

"Thank you for the license code request to your IBM SPSS software; unfortunately, the IBM SPSS License Key Centre was unable to process your request at this time. Please create a Service Request with IBM Support in order to determine the cause."


CAUSE
The most common cause of this message is by accidentally typing an invalid authorization code. For example, an "f" was entered as '1', a "6" was entered as '5' and so on. Please ensure that the authorization code entered is correct.
Also note that Authorization Codes only contain letters between "A" to "F".



ANSWER
After checking your code, if you still require further assistance, please proceed in raising a Service Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support. When raising a Service Request, please provide a photo of your authorization code. This will allow our Support Analysts to double check the code and ensure its validity.
