ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SolidWorks file can not be opened
   This issue appears to be occurring because the R14
   release of SolidWorks Integration does not
   properly get
   removed when it is uninstalled and it leaves
   residual registry entries behind which affect
   SolidWorks when you
   install SMARTEAM V5 R17 with SolidWorks
   Integration.
   Here is the scenario that you can use in order to
   replicate this
   issue:
   -----
   Assuming that SolidWorks is already
   installed.
   - Install SMARTEAM - Editor V5
   R14
   - Install SolidWorks Integration from the separate
   installation package for
   R14
   - Install SP10 for SMARTEAM V5
   R14
   - Run SolidWorks and as you can see the
   SMARTEAM Integration appears to work just
   fine
   - Remove SolidWorks Integration from
   Add/Remove Programs
   - Remove SMARTEAM - Editor from Add/Remove
   Programs
   - Install SMARTEAM - Editor V5
   R17
   - Install SolidWorks Integration from the separate
   installation package for
   R17
   - Install SP6 for SMARTEAM V5
   R17
   - Run SolidWorks and as you can see the
   SMARTEAM
   Integration appears to load up three times and
   there are multiple SmarTeam Add-Ins listed in
   SolidWorks under Tools >
   Add-
   Ins
   This makes SolidWorks very unstable and it
   crashes a lot.
   -----
   Here are a few locations where you can see that
   the R14
   registry entries have not been
   removed:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wind
   ows\Current
   Version\Installer\UserData\S-1-5-
   18
   \Components\22CD6237B341D3E40BB168642F6730
   E1
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wind
   ows\Current
   Version\Installer\UserData\S-1-5-
   18
   \Components\30A340F3C3D8CF248AEE9FBE2A0ED

   18
   \Components\87C8F3E02211F524E8A247FC9E2D78
   0D
   Under each of those keys you will see that the R14
   settings still
   remain even when it has been
   uninstalled:

   Dear L1,
   ..
   On the WebEx with RAND 25/10/2007 was
   demonstrated DAMECA DB with some problematic
   situation reported in
   PMR 87365,010,678.
   ..
   There was demonstrated some critsit as Check Out
   cannot be done for Checked In assembly for ?flk?
   user is using it ?
   ST message.
   One of assembly?s CFO?s has had no configurations
   in ST, though previously it was one of three
   configurations.
   ..
   There three ST objects exists, as related to the
   very same file name, but one of them is excluded /
   divided,
   having no CFO and different TDM_FILE_ID.
   ..
   As it was investigated and explained during the
   WebEx, previous steps moved to this situation
   probably were next:
   1. Having several Checked In Assembly
   configuration some user did Check Out for only one
   configuration ? this operation made Checked In
   configurations be locked
   2. The user has deleted Checked In object of this
   configuration
   3. The user did Check In for Checked Out
   configuration, which had now no CFO link to both
   other configurations that remained to be locked.
   ..
   Our LC expert had fixed manually the problem with
   Checking Out reported assembly by deleting some
   record about
   locking in OBJECT_LOCKING table for the
   corrupted object found in TN_DOCUMENTATION
   table in customer DB.
   ..
   After that the assembly was Checked Out
   successfully without of any message as ?flk? user is
   using it.
   ..
   Besides, the whole assembly structure remained
   corrupted for there are two different files with the
   same file name:
   one for divided configuration object and another
   one for two configurations that remained to point to
   the initial
   file.
   ..
   Please consider that critical step for corruption was
   #1 and especially #2 in the above previous
   scenario.
   ..
   It probably made the described corruption in the
   DB and in the assembly.
   ..
   Please refer to SMARTEAM-SolidWorks Integration
   Help.
   ..
   We have advised with our Product Management
   about this issue.
   According to PM this is methodological issue, not
   for code fix.
   ..
   By my mistake I have occasionally created APAR
   for this issue
   (actually I wanted to create APAR for other RAND
   PMR, related to Two SW Add-Ins).
   ..
   We are closing this APAR and closing this case as
   behavior.
   ..
   Best Regards,
   Boris {bso}
