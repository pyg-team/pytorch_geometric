PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When performing an update or a custom installation of an IBM Business Process Manager or IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1 product, you cannot connect to the service repository to install the updates. 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to connect to the live repository to find additional fixes, none of the fixes in the live repository are found.


CAUSE

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, add the service repository URLs to the IBM Installation Manager preferences. You can add the URLs either before or after installing the Version 8.0.1 products. If you want to install the latest fix pack and any mandatory interim fixes during the product installation, install Installation Manager and add the repository URLs before installing one of the IBM Business Process Manager or IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1 products. If completing an update, add the service repositories before attempting to complete the update.

 1. Start IBM Installation Manager.
    
    
 2. Select File > Preferences.
