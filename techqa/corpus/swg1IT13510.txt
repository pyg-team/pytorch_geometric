LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer can run the following health check as noted in the
   following URL and let us know if the issue is still
   being reported.
   https://ibm.biz/BdHCQY [https://ibm.biz/BdHCQY]
   
   Customer may also "utilize Step #5 of the Introduction to
   Troubleshooting Section of the Health Check Technote to verify
   the Total and Available numbers match.
   https://ibm.biz/BdHCQ2 [https://ibm.biz/BdHCQ2]
   
   Check the storage nodes: System Console > Hardware > Storage
   Devices. Look at all the Storage Nodes and Storage Node
   Expansions to make sure the Disk Drives, LUNs, and Storage
   Controller Ports are all available for each node.
   
   Check the "Total" and "Available" counts for Disk Drives, LUNS,
   and Ports. The values should be equal.
   
   If there is a problem, click on the "Generate" button on the
   "Request System Logs" line on the web page.
   
   The latter technote describes how to save and send the logs in
   the MustGather by opening a PMR with IBM Support in the
   "Contacting IBM Support and sending in your information"
   section.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The query storage code that is checking for offline storage
   needs to ignore offline snapshots.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.2.2.0.
