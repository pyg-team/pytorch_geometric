APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Setting up a Alcatel-Lucent SAM 5620 probe on a Redhat 5.6
   64bits sserver,
   the probe worked fine, except it was taking 98~99% of
   CPU.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  First SE ran strace against the PID of the probe as root user:
   
   #strace -f -o /tmp/strace.out -p <PID>
   after couple of seconds, SE send Ctrl-C to STDIN then check the
   content
   /tmp/strace.out , He found following lines :
   
   15607 open("/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_notifier",
   O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_LARGEFILE, 0644) = -1 EACCES
   (Permission
   denied)
   15607 open("/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_notifier",
   O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_LARGEFILE, 0644) = -1 EACCES
   (Permission
   denied)
   
   from this SE knew that the probe was trying to open those file
   and failed
   SE stopped the probe, removed /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach
   directory then
   restarted the probe. it has been running happily since then.
   
   The root cause of this issue was that he had run the probe as
   root before for testing
   and notice that the temporary directory was not removed when
   probe quit.
   
   The local fix can either be by removing the directory or
   to disable the API feature in Omnibus probes by setting Java
   env
   using $NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS as below:
   export NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS=-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The local fix can either be by removing the directory or
   to disable the API feature in Omnibus probes by setting Java
   env
   using $NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS as below:
   export NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS=-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no
   
   
    
   
   

COMMENTS
 *  Java Attach API is not being utilized by probe, so can be
   disabled.
