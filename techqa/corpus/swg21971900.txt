 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM SDK Java Technology Edition, Version 6 and 7, that is used by IBM OS Images for Red Hat Linux Systems, AIX, and Windows. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in July 2015.

This bulletin also addresses the Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 3.0.0.0 and earlier.
IBM OS Image for AIX Systems 2.1.1.0 and earlier.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Virtual machines deployed from IBM PureApplication Systems are affected. This includes RedHat Linux, AIX-based, and Windows-based deployments. The solution is to apply the following IBM PureApplication System fix to the deployed virtual machines.

1. Import the fix into the Emergency Fix catalogue.
2. For deployed instances, apply this emergency fix on the VM. 
3. Restart the deployed instance after the fix is applied.


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
