APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPD instances cannot be viewed in Process Inspector after being
   started in a manner similar to the following.
   
   A BPD is started via a service which uses the startBpdWithName
   JavaScript API to start the BPD. The service is started via the
   REST APIs using the POST (start) method of
   /rest/bpm/wle/v1/service/.
   
   When the BPD is started one of the TIP columns from the
   LSW_BPD_INSTANCE table is incorrectly set to 'T' instead of 'F'.
   This prevents the BPDs from being viewed in the Process
   Inspector section of Process Designer, unless the related
   snapshot is the tip of the process.
   
   This issue is also similar to that in APAR JR43362 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR43362].
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the LSW_BPD_INSTANCE table, set the TIP column to 'F' for
   BPD instances which are not related to the process tip.

   ****************************************************************
   Launching a BPD by specifying its name results in the BPD at
   the tip of the branch for the default snapshot being started,
   regardless of whether Process Center or Process Server is
   being used. ‚   Since "tip" is not a concept supported by
   Process Server, a Process Designer user would not see the
   launched BPD in the Process Inspector.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A check for the type of environment (Process Center or
   Process Server) was added to the code.  For Process Center,
   the BPD at the tip of the branch of the default snapshot will
   be started, while for Process Server, the BPD of the default
   snapshot will be started.
