QUESTION
 JDBC Probe : How can you configure the JDBC Probe? 

ANSWER
The Support Guide to the JDBC Probe explains how the JDBC Probe works and provides two example configurations using the MarkerColumn method. 

Examples given: 

 * Connecting to Oracle using a MarkerColumn 
 * Connecting to DB2 using a MarkerColumn 
 * Connecting to Sybase using a MarkerColumn


NOTE: 

In Netcool/OMNIbus 7.4 and above, you can use a 64-bit java, which may make it necessary to restrict memory allocation to the probe process. This is done as follows: 


Java probes can be limited in size using the -Xmx option, which can be set in the probes env file found in $NCHOME/omnibus/probes/java.
e.g.
# NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS are general options
# NCO_JPROBE_JAVA_XFLAGS are non-portable JVM options
JPROBE_JAVA_FLAGS="-Xmx1000m"
#EOF

Provided the probes java gives a -version output with that memory option, for example:
csh
set path=($NCHOME/platform/linux2x86/jre64_1.7.0/jre/bin $path)
rehash
java -Xmx1000m -version 

The allocated memory should not use up all free memory as probes will need some non-native memory to function properly.
