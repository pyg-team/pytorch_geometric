Title: IBM Minimal sample to execute Excel file with Decision Validation Service - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When troubleshooting the execution of an Excel scenario suite with Decision Validation Service (DVS) it can be beneficial to use a minimal sample to help reproduce the issue and ease debugging.
Also in case there is a need to integrate the execution of DVS scenario files with a homegrown or third party test harness, then starting from a minimal sample can ease the integration. 

SYMPTOM
Execution of a DVS scenario suite fails to complete or gives unexpected result.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The attached sample Rule Studio project consists in a single source file with a main method that performs a DVS run using the tutorial artifacts as an example. The program takes two arguments: first is the ruleset file , second is the excel file. 

The sample can be imported in a Rule Studio workspace with: 

 File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace 

Then choose "Select archive file" and click "Browse" button to point to the dvs-runner.zip file. 

 

The sample can be launched through Rule Studio menu: 

 Run Configurations > Java Application > LocalExcelRunner 

It can also be launched from the command line through ant with ant run (you need to edit build.xml file to set the jrules.home property to point to a local JRules installation directory).
