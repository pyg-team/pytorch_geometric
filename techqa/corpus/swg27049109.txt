WHAT'S NEW
Opens a new dimension for Accelerator deployment in the cloud 

 DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Version 6.1 delivers support for the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS on Cloud Version 1.1. This establishes a new dimension for Accelerator deployment that extends query acceleration capabilities to a secure cloud environment. DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Version 6.1 continues to provide full support for the on-premise PureData Systems for Analytics appliance while expanding deployment options for organizations who are adopting a hybrid cloud strategy. 

 Prior versions of the Accelerator were defined as a high-performance appliance that integrates the IBM z Systems® infrastructure with IBM PureData™ System for Analytics, powered by IBM Netezza® technology. DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Version 6.1 expands support beyond the appliance model to also include a cloud-based option. 

 *  Delivers support for the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS on Cloud Version 1.1, built on the IBM SoftLayer® global cloud infrastructure and based on dashDB® software 
 *  Assists organizations on their journey to a hybrid cloud model with tight integration between appliance and cloud deployment options 
 *  Speed and simplify the deployment of new or additional Accelerator instances with the option of deploying applicable workload on the cloud 

Beyond the support of the new cloud-base options, new functions are also available for the appliance based model:  *  Adds support for additional IBM Netezza Analytics stored procedures 
 *  Enables support of R functions through the ibmdbR R-package. This addition enables in-database analytics on DB2 for z/OS using R, which is the most popular language used by data scientists. 

 

MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS
There are no migration considerations.  

 

CONDITIONS FOR QUERY ROUTING
Queries can be routed to an accelerator only if certain conditions are met. There are also adverse conditions that prohibit query acceleration.  For more information please see Conditions for query routing to an accelerator [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4LQ8_6.1.0/com.ibm.datatools.aqt.doc/gui/concepts/c_idaa_query_offloading_criteria.html] 

 

KNOWN ISSUES
 1.  Currently IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS Cloud Support cannot handle queries that reference system-temporal or business-temporal tables. This means that queries containing one or more of the following clauses cannot be accelerated:  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF
    FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM ... TO ...
    FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN ... AND ...
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME AS OF
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME FROM ... TO ...
    FOR BUSINESS_TIME BETWEEN ... AND... 
    
    
 2.  Under rare conditions, a reload of a segmented table might not be completed.
    Symptom: Error message "StoredProcedureException: An internal error occurred on the ' ' accelerator..:" 
    Workaround: Restart the load job. 
 3.  You might see a performance degradation if you reload the same partitioned table over and over again. 
    Workaround: Remove the table from the accelerator, then redefine and reload it.
