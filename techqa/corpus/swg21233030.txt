PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive the following error message when searching for updates of installed products using the Find and Install feature in IBM® Rational® Software Architect: 
Network connection problems encountered during search. 

CAUSE
The rest of the error message reads, 
Unable to access "http://pxdebldp1.ottawa.ibm.com/prototype/bom/integration/ com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration.site/".
Unable to access site: "http://pxdebldp1.ottawa.ibm.com/prototype/bom/integration/ com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration.site/" [Operation timed out: connect:could be due to invalid address]
Unable to access site: "http://pxdebldp1.ottawa.ibm.com/prototype/bom/integration/ com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration.site/site.xml" [Operation timed out: connect:could be due to invalid address] 

The Eclipse™ Install/Updater attempts to access a URL that is no longer valid. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To turn off this feature and prevent the error message from displaying, follow these steps: 

 

 1. Go to <RSA Install Dir>\rsa\eclipse\features\com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration_xxxx (where xxxx is the WBI-RSA integration feature number)
    
 2. Edit the feature.xml file and remove the following lines:
    <url>
    <update label="BOM Model Support Prototype Update Site" url="http://pxdebldp1.ottawa.ibm.com/prototype/bom/integration/ com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration.site/"/>
    <discovery label="BOM Model Support Prototype Update Site" url="http://pxdebldp1.ottawa.ibm.com/prototype/bom/integration/ com.ibm.xtools.uml2.bom.integration.site/"/>
    </url>
    
 3. Save and close


Any updates regarding BoM (Bill of Materials) and WBI (WebSphere® Business Integration) should be performed using the Rational Product Updater in this manner: 
 1. In RSA, choose Help > Software Updates > IBM Rational Product Updater
    or from the Start menu, choose All Programs > IBM Rational > Rational Product Updater 
 2. Click Find Updates
