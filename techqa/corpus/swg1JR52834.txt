LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION -
   When you deploy a snapshot on IBM Process Server, the deployed
   snapshot  automatically activates when deployment completes.
   However, you might not want automatic activation in some
   environments.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   LOCAL FIX -
   None
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   In V8.5.6.0 when you run the BPMInstallOfflinePackage or
   BPMInstallPackage commands to deploy a snapshot, the snapshot
   status automatically activates when deployment successfully
   completes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 that introduces a new
   parameter, ?-inactive true?, for the BPMInstallOfflinePackage
   and BPMInstallPackage commands that allows admin users to toggle
    the auto activate feature during deployment. This parameter can
    be passed into the wsadmin command to disable the auto activate
    behavior.
   
   A sample command would be
   wsadmin>AdminTask.BPMInstallOfflinePackage('[-inputFile
   C:/myProcessApps/BillingDispute.zip -inactive true]')
