taskmaster web error messages TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a setting that can disable or suppress web error messages in the Datacap Taskmaster Capture thin client? 

ANSWER
No, there is currently no setting that would allow web error messages to be suppressed or disabled. IBM Lab Services [http://www.ibm.com/software/ecm/services/] does have the ability to customize Datacap Taskmaster to do this, but the customization is not supported by IBM Support.
