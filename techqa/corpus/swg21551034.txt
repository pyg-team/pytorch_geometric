QUESTION
 How to create an application data manager in GENTRAN:Server for UNIX 5.4 (SCI2033) 

ANSWER
1) The .ddf file which describes the application data being processed must have a field in the header record called TPCODE (all in caps)

2) The input file (flat file) has to have the trading partner code in the header record, in the position as designated in the .ddf file

The application data manager will use the .ddf file to find the trading partner code. It will process each partner's data according to this trading partner code, allowing the input data for different trading partners to be written into different file names or even different directories for processing by other data managers.

3) Set up an application data manager with the following configuration record values:

ROUTING_METHOD 2 (This will make the data manager process each set of input data separately, so data from several different trading partners in the filewill be processed separately)

INPUT_FN_APP_TP 0 (This requires the input file to be named for the .ddf file)

4) Create one or more configuration records for the trading partner(s) you wish to process, either manually or by using a pattern:
For example:
Trading Partner Code: TPCODE1
Destination directory: destdir1
Destination file name: destfile1

Trading Partner Code: TPCODE2
Destination directory: destdir2
Destination file name: destfile2

Trading Partner Code: TPCODE3
Destination directory: destdir3
Destination file name: destfile3
