Title: IBM How to Import a .p7b Chained Certificate - United States

Text:
CERT; SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Importing a chained certificate file with a .p7b extension can be done by extracting the CA certificates contained in the chain, then importing each CA certificate individually, then importing the server certificate. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To import the certificates contained within the chain, you will need to open the file on a PC. You should double-click the file to open it (or select the 'open' option if it is still in your mail file). You should see something similar to a Windows hierarchy in the opened file. Navigate down until you can see the individual certificates contained in the file.

Next, we are going to want to export the certificates within the chain. Right click one of the certificates in the list, select All Tasks, and select Export.

Follow the steps through the export wizard. Select Next to begin.

Select Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) and click Next.

Choose a location on your PC where the certificate file will be saved. I used the c:\temp directory; however, any location you can easily access will work. Click Next.

You will get a summary page. Click the Finish button, and the certificate will be placed in the location specified in the previous step.

Repeat the previous steps for all the certificates in the chain that are needed. After the certificates have all been exported and saved to a location on the PC, you will need to move them to an IFS directory on the IBM i. This can be done by using FTP, System i Navigator, Netserver shares, or other third-party applications that may be used to work with the IFS. 

Once the files are in an IFS directory, it is time to go into Digital Certificate Manager (DCM) to import those certificate files. 

DCM is accessed by typing the following URL in the web browser (replace systemnamewith the name or IP address of the system):

http:// systemname:2001/QIBM/ICSS/Cert/Admin/qycucm1.ndm/main0 

Note: This document assumes that the *SYSTEM store has already been created and that the user knows the password for that store.

Select the Manage Certificates link on the left, and then click on Import Certificate. Depending on what kind of certificate you are importing, make your next selection based on this. It will most likely be a CA certificate, so select the option for CA certificate (Certificate Authority). Click Continue.

On the next screen, you will have to put in a path and file name. This is the location and name of the file on the IFS of the IBM i. For example, if you stored the file in the /home directory and the file was called 'cert.txt' you would put in a path and file name of /home/cert.txt. Click Continue.

The next screen will ask you to create a CA certificate Label. This can be any name you want as long as it is unique (should not match any labels for any other certificates). I would recommend giving it a label name that matches what the certificate provider called it for ease of recognition. Click Continue.

You should get a message saying the certificate has been imported. Click OK and you are done with the import process. Repeat as necessary for any other certificates required.
