 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 /var file system is almost full now with many files under /var/spool/abrt directory. 

CAUSE
All crash report and back trace from kernel driver is written on subdirectories of /var/spool/abrt directory.

ANSWER
To permanently stop this back trace gathering, we need to stop below two processes. 

# service abrtd stop 

# service abrt-oops stop 

And we can remove all those directories and files with following rm command: 

# abrt-cli rm /var/spool/abrt/*
