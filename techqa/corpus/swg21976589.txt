QUESTION
 We have configured a new LDAP server in Atlas but why does authentication work for only some users ? 

CAUSE
Atlas login fails with "Authentication failed: Unknown user (or) password"

ANSWER
Make sure the user who failed to login exists in Atlas and is active. If not , create the corresponding user manually or use HR Loader to import those users who are part of the new LDAP server.
