Transformation Extender WTX ITX GSKit security vulnerability SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities have been addressed in the GSKit component of Transformation Extender. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-0201 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0201]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a MD5 collision. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-7421 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7421]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The internal ICC PRNG pool state is duplicated during a fork() system call operation which results in a period of time where child processes may generate identical PRNG output to the parent. This may allow possible attacks related to predictable state which an attacker could exploit.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
