ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue :
   Customer has a JSR 168 Portlet project with a Struts Portlet,
   when he
   tries to create a new Struts Portlet in the same project by
   right click on the portlet deployment descriptor > New > Portlet
   and selects Struts portlet radio button in the dialog box , he
   gets an error shown in the same dialog box and Finish/NeXT
   button
   gets disabled.
   
   This issue is reproducible at 6011+ifix001 level with PTE v5102.
   Explanation :
   I got the following update from Portal Designer team ..
   <Portal Desiger Team>
   Hi, Robin, this is a known limitation that has been there since
   the start of Struts portlet support in RAD.  This will still be
   the case with the coming release of RAD v7.
   </Portal Desiger Team>
   1)
   <Robin> Thanks for the update. But I am surprised (*read
   'shocked') to find this. Please correct me I am wrong in the
   following understanding.  </Robin>
   <Portal Desiger Team>
   This was just not containable. The reason there is such a
   limitation is due to how Struts portlet tools is built on top of
   Struts servlet tool.  And initially - the Struts servlet tool
   only allows one Struts servlet per web project.    So to allow
   multiple Struts portlet in the same project from the tool will
   affect everything (links resolution, WDE, Struts project
   navigation) .  Additionally, Struts tools are not priority for
   the team any more... so - its just not worth the additional
   work. .
   (Note that it was designed for RAD V7 - see:
   https://radical.raleigh.ibm.com/daisy/main/wde_struts/V7/v7docs/
   17492.html [https://radical.raleigh.ibm.com/daisy/main/wde_struts/V7/v7docs/17492.html]  but it was dropped due to resource constraints)
   </Portal Desiger Team>
   2)
   <robin> So that essentially means our portlet tooling limits the
   developer to have one Struts portlet per portlet project.
   </Robin>
   <Portal Desiger Team>  Yes.  </Portal Desiger Team>
   3)
   <robin> Dont we have a workaround for this issue ?  (*I just
   checked/confirmed that we have this limitation in both IBM
   portlet project as well JSR168 Portlet project) </robin>
   <Portal Desiger Team>
   What kind of workaround are you looking for?   Its not a runtime
   problem... the user can simply add a Struts portlet to their
   config file if they want (with additional parameters added) .
   There are some examples that they can look at - available from
   portal server ..   We just don't have tools to support it.
