Title: IBM Migrate Electronic Service Agent (ESA) from using Java 6 to Java 8 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 With support for Java 6 scheduled to end starting 2018, these PTFs allow ESA to use Java 8 instead. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For V7R1 and V7R2 systems, Java 6 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 11 and JV1 option 12) are used By Electronic Service Agent (ESA) by default. 

With support for Java 6 scheduled to end starting 2018, these PTFs allow to change ESA to use 
Java 8 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 16 and JV1 option 17) instead. 

V7R3 systems already use Java 8 32-bit and 64-bit by default.


Note: Java 8 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 16 and JV1 option 17) are required to be on system prior to apply the PTFs. Pre/co requisite PTFs might be downloaded. Assure to apply them also.
Information about how to obtain the options could be found at following document:
N1020692: Support of Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.0 on the IBM i OS [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020692]

Disable/enable ESA is recommended after PTFs application. Then force collection.
