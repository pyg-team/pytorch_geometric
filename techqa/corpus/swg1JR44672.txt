 *  When trying to create snapshot of a process app, users may
   encounter failure and exception below:
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException:

   DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-803, SQLSTATE=23505,
   SQLERRMC=3;DB2INST1.

   Acronym generation code in BPM 7501 did not take into
   consideration the
   acronym of archived snapshots. This resulted in non-unique
   acronym
   generation and subsequent Constraint Violations exceptions in
   DB. This fix will check for all existing acronyms in archived or
    unarchived state while
   generating unique acronym.
