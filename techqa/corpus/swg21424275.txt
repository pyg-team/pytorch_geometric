QUESTION
 How do I install IBM Rational Functional Tester Java Scripting on Microsoft Windows 7 64-bit? 

CAUSE
Microsoft Windows 7 support was introduced in IBM Rational Functional Tester 8.1.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24025806]. There are specific steps which must be followed to successfully IBM Rational Functional Tester Java Scripting on Microsoft Windows 7 64-bit.

ANSWER
For the purposes of this technote, we will focus on Rational Functional Tester 8.1.1 Java Scripting deployed on a Windows 7 Profession Edition 64-bit machine using new instance of Eclipse. The concepts described in this technote might also apply to other versions and editions.


 1.  Verify that your machine meets the Software Requirements [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rfthelp/v8r1/topic/com.ibm.rational.test.ft.install.doc/topics/r_software_reqs.html] and Hardware Requirements [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rfthelp/v8r1/topic/com.ibm.rational.test.ft.install.doc/topics/r_hardware_reqs.html] of Rational Functional Tester. 
 2.  Download and install IBM Installation Manager 1.3.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24024682] or later. The version of IBM Installation Manager packaged with Rational Functional Tester 8.1.x is not certified for Windows 7; you should not use it for Windows 7 deployments. 
 3.  Download and unzip the Rational Functional Tester 8.1 installation disks from IBM Passport Advantage Online [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm]. There are three disks; you will need all three.
     * IBM Rational Functional Tester V8.1 Setup Multilingual Multiplatform (CZ7LXML)
     * IBM Rational Functional Tester V8.1 Multilingual Multiplatform Part 1 (CZ3KXML)
     * IBM Rational Functional Tester V8.1 Multilingual Multiplatform Part 2 (CZ3KYML) 
 4.  Download and unzip the Rational Functional Tester 8.1.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24025806] update disks. There are two disks; you will need both:
     * rft811.update.disk1.zip [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v8/rft/811/zips/rft811.update.disk1.zip]
     * rft811.update.disk2.zip [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v8/rft/811/zips/rft811.update.disk2.zip] 
 5.  Configure IBM Installation Manager to run with Administrator privileges.
     
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424275&amp;aid=1] 
 6.  Launch IBM Installation Manager and open File > Preferences > Repositories. Add RFT_SETUP\diskTag.inf from the 8.1 installation disks. Add disk1\diskTag.inf from the 8.1.1 update disks. If you are using an authorized user license, you can optionally add the activation kit JAR as a repository. Click OK to save changes.

 9.  Launch Rational Functional Tester Java Scripting (Eclipse). 
 10. If you are using a workspace with projects from an older version of Rational Functional Tester, you must disconnect from and reconnect to each project. 
     Right-click each project in the Functional Test Projects view and click Disconnect Project.
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424275&amp;aid=4]
     Click File > Connect to a Functional Test Project.
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424275&amp;aid=5]
     
     Browse to or enter the full path to the project folder, then click Finish to connect to the project.
