   Current Behaviour
   -----------------
   The current behaviour is, some of the sql functions like
   hourofday(), dayname(), monthname() does not work in Filter
   Builder.
   
   Expected Behaviour
   ------------------
   The functions hourofday(), dayname(), monthname() which work in
   sql should also work in FilterBuilder.

   ------------
   Yes
   
   Steps to replicate (if applicable)
   ----------------------------------
   1. $OMNIHOME/bin/nco
   2. Open the Event List
   3. Open the Filter Builder
   4. Try to add a Filter using functions like hourofday(),
   dayname(), monthname().
   PS: You will be able to add this when you click on 'Edit SQL'
   and try to add the sql functions.
   5. You will not be allowed to enter the these sql functions.
   Just design a ordinary filter using these functions that does
   not work
   (LastOccurrence < getdate (monthname))
   
   
   
   whereas if you edit the .elf file manaully to include these
   functions they work - so the sql parser in v7 recognises them -
   and can use them as per nco_sql for example, but the design of
   the filter builder isnt allowing the usage of these

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the 7.x UNIX filter builder in the  *
   *                 Event List and Conductor.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The filter builder does not allow some  *
   *                      SQL conditions to be constructed.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The filter builder available from the Event List and conductor
   is restricted to the 3.x SQL and does not allow the extensions
   introduced in v7 to be constructed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The UNIX Filter Builder has been extended to allow more
   advanced conditions to be created. The Filter Builder allows
   the construction of predicates of different levels of
   complexity. The existing 'Simple' and 'Complex' types are
   restricted to predicates of the form 'ColumnName operator
   expression'. The new 'Freeform' type permits you to enter an
   arbitary predicate. This allows the advanced features of the v7
   ObjectServer SQL to be used. As each predicate is edited, it is
   validated by the ObjectServer. Individual predicates are built
   into a complete condition as before.
