CAUSE
Due to java compatibility considerations between the 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 and 5.0.0.4-P8PE-FP004 fix packs, you cannot simply follow the fix pack installation instructions in the readme file of 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004. The 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 fix pack has to be configured with the java runtime (JRE) library from the 5.0.0.3-P8CA-FP003 fix pack. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. If you have already installed the 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 fix pack, then install the 5.0.0.3-P8CA-FP003 fix pack on top of it. You can follow the installation instructions in the readme of 5.0.0.3-P8CA-FP003 to do this. Before the installation of the 5.0.0.3-P8CA-FP003 fix pack:  1. Make sure that the Case Analyzer Process Task Manager is closed. 
     2. Make sure that the Microsoft® Windows service called Case Analyzer Services Manager is stopped. 
     3. Make sure no java processes are running in the Windows Task Manager.
    
    
 2. Check JRE version in the java runtime (JRE) library for Case Analyzer.  1. Open a command prompt, and change directories to the [Case Analyzer installation location]\java\jre\bin folder (for example: \Program Files (x86)\IBM\FileNet\Case Analyzer Engine\java\jre\bin). 
     2. Run the following command: java -version 
     3. You should find the JRE 1.6.0 SR10 FP1 version. For example:
        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675272&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675272&aid=2]
    
    
 3. Create a backup copy of the complete Case Analyzer Engine folder (installation directory), for example: \Program Files (x86)\ibm\FileNet\Case Analyzer Engine\. 
 4. Install the 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 fix pack. You can follow the installation instructions in the readme of 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 to complete this step. Before the installation of the 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 fix pack:  1. Make sure that the Case Analyzer Process Task Manager is closed. 
     2. Make sure that the Microsoft® Windows service called Case Analyzer Services Manager is stopped. 
     3. Make sure no java processes are running in the Windows Task Manager.
    
    
 5. After the installation of the 5.0.0.4-P8CA-FP004 fix pack, make sure no java processes are running in the Windows Task Manager. 
 6. Replace the java subfolder under the [Case Analyzer installation location] folder (for example: \Program Files (x86)\IBM\FileNet\Case Analyzer Engine\java) with a copy of the java folder under the backup of the Case Analyzer Engine folder created in step 3. 
 7. Restart the Microsoft® Windows service called Case Analyzer Services Manager twice. 
 8. Open the Case Analyzer Process Task Manager and start Case Analyzer.
