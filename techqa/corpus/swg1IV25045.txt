LOCAL FIX
 *  Errors can be ignored, no Fixpack is required with Omnibus 7.3.0
   or 7.3.1 to support Mttrapd probe version 12.0.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users running the SNMP Probe Configuration Analyser on   *
   * Netcool/OMNIbus 7.3.0 or 7.3.1.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When the user runs the Configuration Analyser, the SNMP      *
   * Probe generates error messages that do not reflect the       *
   * situation.  The following error messages are written to the  *
   * error log:                                                   *
   *                                                              *
   * "Check gskit library level:  Check that the gskit library is *
   * at the correct level for the version of Omnibus"             *
   * "The following exception has been thrown:  Cannot run        *
   * program"/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/install/ncisetup"            *
   *                                                              *
   * "Check libncrypt library level:  Check that the libncrypt    *
   * library is at the correct level for the version of Omnibus"  *
   * "The following exception has been thrown:  Cannot run        *
   * program"/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/install/ncisetup"            *
   *                                                              *
   * But these error messages can be ignored, the first because   *
   * the correct versions of gskit and libncrypt are included     *
   * with OMNIbus versions 7.3.0 and 7.3.1, and the second        *
   * because it incorrectly indicates a problem in the operation  *
   * of the probe.                                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The SNMP Probe Reference Guide will be updated and released  *
   * during the asynchrous uploads in September.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following information will be added as Known Issue at the
   end of the SNMP Probe Reference Guide:
   
   Known Issue
   ===========
   If you are running the probe on Netcool/OMNIbus version 7.3.0 or
   7.3.1, and you run the Configuration Analyser, the probe may
   write the following messages to the error log:
   
   "Check gskit library level:  Check that the gskit library is at
   the correct level for the version of Omnibus"
   "The following exception has been thrown:  Cannot run
   program"/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/install/ncisetup"
   
   "Check libncrypt library level:  Check that the libncrypt
   library is at the correct level for the version of Omnibus"
   "The following exception has been thrown:  Cannot run
   program"/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/install/ncisetup"
   
   
   Both of these error messages can be ignored because the correct
   versions of gskit and libncrypt are included with OMNIbus
   versions 7.3.0 and 7.3.1. The Configuration Analyser is
   attempting to run a command that is no longer in
   Netcool/OMNIbus, but this will not affect its operation.
