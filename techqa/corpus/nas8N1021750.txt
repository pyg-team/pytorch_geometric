 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 ISC BIND is vulnerable to several security vulnerabilities. IBM i has addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2775 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2775]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when lwresd or the named lwres option is enabled. By sending an overly long request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the daemon to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115477 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115477] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2776 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2776]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an assertion failure in buffer.c while a nameserver is building responses to a specifically constructed request. By sending a specially crafted DNS packet, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117246 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117246] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)




CVEID: CVE-2016-6170 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6170]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending an overly large AXFR and IXFR response, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a primary and secondary DNS server crash.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114759 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114759] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)




CVEID: CVE-2016-8864 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8864]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of responses containing a DNAME answer in db.c or resolver.c. By sending a recursive response, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118526 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118526] for the current score
