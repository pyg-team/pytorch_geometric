Q: What are the minimum requirements to run DCT?
A: Lotus Notes 8 or later versions with Read access to the Domino Directory and View-only administrator access to the server.

Q: What's the purpose of DCT?
A: DCT aims to provide a healthier server environment. We like to call it "Software Engineering In a Box."

Q: How often are rules updated and when are updates released? 
A. On the first Tuesday of each month. The first update was released on June 2, 2009. We get suggestions and enhancements for updates from the wiki, blogs, forums, and so on.

Q. I'm getting errors when opening the DCT database after an update. Some of the errors involve script libraries and indicate "Warning - HIGH." How do you fix this?
A: The errors occur if you update and do not restart Notes. The solution is to always restart Notes after an update. 

Q: Can you automate DCT scans to run on a schedule?
A: No. We are looking at this as an enhancement.

Q: Can I suggest a new rule?
A: Yes. Feedback on DCT including suggestions for new rules can be provided in the DCT wiki or the DCT blog.

Q: Is DCT a replacement for Domino Domain Monitoring (DDM)?
A: No. DCT is a static configuration analysis tool. DDM monitors server run-time issues. DDM is a live monitor of servers whereas DCT looks at one point in time and interprets runtime behavior.

Q: What does DCT scan? Is it just the Names & Address book?
A: DCT pulls information from the notes.ini file, Server documents, and Configuration documents. DCT looks at the configuration settings to see if something's out of line. For example, if you have a "disable cache" parameter set in the notes.ini file, DCT will actually shut down the cache. 

Q: I'm using the Out Of Office setting in N/D 8.5. How does this affect DCT?
A: Although this is outside the scope of DCT, we will review and possibly consider a rule for this.

Q: What is the significance of the Nagle algorithm?
A: Nagle is a compression algorithm that issues recommendations for problems such as slow network performance. It provides references to the wiki plus links to relevant technotes for problem solving. Nagle takes operating systems into account when running tests. Some recommendations are operating system-specific such as buffer pool size and the impact of memory limitations (example is iSeries which is different from Windows/Linux).

Q: Is the Nagle algorithm available by default?
A: Yes it is. We are evaluating a button to turn Nagle off so you don't have to manually disable it. The rule looks to see if you're running a tested/later version. If you're not, turn off this rule. 

Q: How does DCT work with different infrastructures and operating systems? Is there a setting that must be checked regarding operating systems? 
A: DCT is platform-aware when running tests. You must evaluate whether or not to add notes.ini file settings since DCT recommends suggestions based on the parameters in the .ini file. The goal is to relieve the burden from the customer about whether or not something should be added. In the Preferences is a list of the rules so if there is a setting that warns you every time of something non-consequential, you can shut it off. Ease of use was our design goal.

Q: If I'm using a Notes/Domino 8.5 admin server with 30 servers running Notes/Domino version 6.5 out in the field, how will DCT interact with those field servers?
A: DCT was extensively tested for 7.0 and later versions, not with versions before 7.0. DCT will run on the 6.5 servers but will automatically issue a rule every time it runs identifying the earlier versions. We are confident that DCT will run but DCT running on versions before 7.0 require more testing.

Q: Can you review the rules list so you can examine various rules?
A: Use Preferences --> Manage Rule Execution. You must do at least one scan to activate the rules display.

Q: Is there a way to run DCT automatically on a set schedule and then e-mail a summary report to an administrator?
A: DCT does not have the ability to automatically run on a schedule.

Q: Can I get a summary report of exceptions so I could get to the central server to disable the rule? Can DCT be configured and/or hard-coded to automatically run against all servers? This way as new servers are installed, I'd automatically get a report and wouldn't have to manually add a server.
A: This functionality is not available but can be considered as a possible new feature. A rule could be added that could be implemented company-wide - a kind of "look for this" feature.

Q: Can DCT include fix packs as a way to communicate that problems are fixed?
A: This can be reviewed for a future upgrade. 

Q: Do I have to stop and restart Services for DCT to work?
A: A button to start the admin process is under review, for example, a "Make It So" button. However, we will never include a button to restart the server.

Q: Does DCT analyze server crashes or report on crash details? Or provide/verify an audit? Will DCT report back to me if a specific server is in trouble? 
A: No. DCT provides existing information about settings and relies on specific rules that you set to indicate problems. It does not check anything from the "outside" or operate globally. We can take these suggestions under advisement and are reviewing the possibility of having DCT review NSD files for crash information.

Q: Is DCT a "point in time" download? Can it be replicated?
A: DCT has its own download database with a button at the top to Check For Updates. The updates are scheduled for one a month, to be released on the first Tuesday of each month.

Q: Does DCT look at each individual configuration/parameter or the whole picture?
A: DCT looks at every specific setting for which there is a rule. The rules cover a wide spectrum - from a rule which always should be on or off to a rule which you might consider but is not necessary for a specific configuration. If the result of a DCT scan is fuzzy, the customer has the opportunity to choose what to do - disable it, enable it, shelve it for future use, and so on. Sometimes a single setting is isolated and other settings interact with it but the individual rule is always taken into account. An example of this is transaction logging. If it's not turned on, other features will fail.

Q: How big are the reports generated by DCT? They seem to contain volumes of data.
A: The reports are concise with quick explanations averaging about 5 lines that are combined with suggestions for what the settings should be. It takes about 5 minutes to download the template, run it, and generate results.

Q: Do DCT results indicate official Lotus recommendations for configuration, tuning, parameters, and so on?
A: The results are based on hundreds of other environments and should not be considered as "official". You can disable a rule if you determine something is not applicable to your situation.

Q: Are there plans to pare down the rule sets so they can be applied to specific functionality such as how HTTP functions on a mail server?
A: You can pare down rule sets by enabling or disabling different rules but DCT does not identify behavioral functionality. 

Q: When you run a scan and then a second scan, does the second report overwrite the first report? What happens to those reports? Can they be printed?
A: Open DCT and look in the upper left corner for the Change link. You can use Change to save and rename reports for your own purposes.

Q: What impact on the server is there when DCT scans the system?
A: DCT runs in the background. It depends on how many servers are running while it walks through the number of documents in your directories, the operating system, and the versions. The impact is usually negligible and usually can't be measured.

Q: I'm a new user. Everything was very easy to understand except for just one point of confusion: DCT runs on Notes 7 versions but should be opened on 8 versions. Can this be clarified?
A: We will add more DCT help for new users.

Q: Do you have to modify or add to the Windows Registry for DCT to work?
A: No.
