APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The log information in the "Creating a profile as a root user
   and assigning ownership to a non-root user" topic is incorrect
   in the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0.x. The log information in step 3 of this task is
   relevant to Version 6.1, but not Version 6.0.x. In WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.0.x, the following directory
   structure does not exist:
   app_server_root/logs/manageprofiles/profile01
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For WebSphere Application Server V6.0.x, a profile_name
   subdirectory does not exist under the
   WAS_HOME/logs/wasprofile path. Rather, these log files are
   located under the PROFILE_HOME/logs directory.
   
   The logs directory is named app_server_root/logs/wasprofile
   rather than app_server_root/logs/wasprofile/profile01.
   
   Instead of chown -R user1
   app_server_root/logs/wasprofile/profile01, the path should read
   chown -R user1 app_server_root/logs/wasprofile
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects users of WebSphere         *
   *                 Application Server Version 6.0.x, who are    *
   *                 creating a profile as a root user and        *
   *                 assigning ownership of the profile to a      *
   *                 non-root user. This APAR does not affect     *
   *                 users of WebSphere Application Server V6.1   *
   *                 who are completing the same task.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The "Creating a profile as a root       *
   *                      user and assigning ownership to a       *
   *                      non-root user" topic says to change     *
   *                      the ownership of a logs directory,      *
   *                      which do not exist for Version 6.0.x.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The topic incorrectly tells users to change ownership of the
   logs directory:
   
   3. Change the ownership of the logs directory for the
   profile01 profile to the user1 non-root user to prevent
   displaying log messages to the console.
   
   Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, AIX: Issue the following command:
   chown -R user1 app_server_root/logs/wasprofile/profile01
   
   Windows: Follow instructions in the Windows documentation to
   grant user1 access to the following directory:
   C:\app_server_root\logs\wasprofile\profile01
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The step that discusses changing ownership of the logs
   directory and references to the logs directory have been
   removed from the Version 6.0.x documentation.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might have been made
   before you read this text. To access the latest on-line
   documentation, complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also

   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the December
   2007 update to the information centers.
