APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The 'RESTORE VM' messages might be misleading as the VMware
   guest name the user is restoring from is indicated, but target
   VMware guest name is only referenced once and not indicated in
   the completion message.
   
   Example :
   
   Restore command :
   dsmc restore vm Dummy -vmname=Dummy_restored
   
   Extract of the output messages :
   
   Restore function invoked.
   Restore VM command started.  Total number of virtual machines
   to process: 1
   Restore of Virtual Machine 'Dummy' started
   ==> here there is no mention of the target guest name and it
   might be misleading as we do not restore onto the original guest
   
   Starting Full VM restore of VMware Virtual Machine 'Dummy'
   target node name='<Datacenter node>', data mover node
   name='<Data mover node>'
   ==> same remark as above : no target guest name seen
   
   Restoring virtual machine 'Dummy' to new VM with name
   'Dummy_Restored'.
   ==> here is the only time the source guest name and target
   guest name are referenced
   
   ==> all following messages where a guest name is indicated miss
   the target guest name :
   
   Restoring VM configuration information for 'Dummy'
   ...
   Restoring      12,582,912   Dummy [Done]
   Successful Full VM restore of Virtual Machine 'Dummy'
   Restore processing finished.
   Successful Full VM restore of VMware Virtual Machine 'Dummy'
   target node name='<Datacenter node>', data mover node
   name='<Data mover node>'
   
   IBM Spectrum Protect Versions Affected:
   All IBM Spectrum Protect Client used as VMware guest data mover
   on Linux and Windows
   
   Products affected:
   IBM Spectrum Protect Backup-Archive Client version
   6.3, 6.4 and 7.1 on Linux and Windows
   Note: The Backup-Archive Client is a prerequisite to using the
   Data Protection for VMware. In Data Protection for VMware
   environments, the Backup-Archive Client is also known as the
   data mover.
   
   This problem also affects IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual
   Environments: Data Protection for VMware 8.1.0. If you are using
   Data Protection for VMware 8.1.0, refer to APAR IT19860 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT19860].
