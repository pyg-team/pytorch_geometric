Title: IBM Creation of the source attribute fails when creating a new binary object in Synergy - United States

Text:
typedef; failed; create; object; binary; source; attribute TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Errors are reported during a reconcile of new binary objects into the database, referring to the source attribute failing to create. 

SYMPTOM
The error is reported to the message view and the product logs. The full error message is as follows:

WARNING: Failed to create the attribute 'source' on somedoc.doc~1:doc:1 Unable to create new object version
.


CAUSE
The problem is caused when a type with a super_type of binary also has a source_init attribute defined.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue: 

Login as a user with the ccm_admin privilege and run: 

 * 
 * 
   ccm set role ccm_admin 
 * cm query -name typename -type cvtype 
 * ccm attr -delete source_init @
   


If the type has been exported to other databases then re-export and import this type into the other databases. When importing the type, ensure to use the /image option. A description of this option is below: 

 * 
 * 
 * Replaces all attributes, for all objects of the specified type, with the attributes in the import directory. New attributes are added, changed properties are replaced, and deleted attributes are removed from the database. 
 * You can use this option only with the /import option. 


For assistance with ccm typedef export and ccm typedef import, then refer to the Synergy CLI help document.
