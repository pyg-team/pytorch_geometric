LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In the STAP Events report, Software Tap Host is being logged
   blank. Cause of the issue was protocol-related in the manner
   that STAP was sending Software Tap information to the Collector.
   Issue was only reported on v10.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Remediated by revising STAP code to properly queue outgoing
   Software Tap messages until required information, such as
   Software Tap IP, are available to send. Fix is available in v10
   STAP r84814.
