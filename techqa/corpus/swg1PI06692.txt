ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Executing the following nodes in Modeler Server on Linux\UNIX
   you see files created in /tmp on the server
   filesystem when expecting all files to be created in the Modeler
   Server defined temporary directory:
   
   These Model Builder nodes:
   Cox Regression
   Logistic Regression
   PCA\Factor
   Genlin
   Discriminant
   
   And also the Sample node in "complex" mode
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This will be addressed in a future version\Fix Pack.
   
   Make the following configuration edits to redirect all files
   created by the execution of this node to the Modeler Server
   temporary directory.
   
   1. edit statsenv.sh in
   <ModelerServer>/ext/bin/spss.xd/xdexe/bin and set
   SPSSTMPDIR_DEFAULT to the Modeler Server temp directory
   
   2. set and exporting a new environment variable, TEMP, to the
   same location you set SPSSTMPDIR_DEFAULT to in step 1. above. in
   the Modeler Server startup script, eg:
   
   TEMP=/usr/IBM/SPSS/ModelerServer/16.0/tmp; export TEMP
   
   Please ensure you perform both steps 1. and 2. as indicated.
