PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Under "Service Management Agent" (SMA) of TEPS tree view, several node names with the same name are seen. Need to show only 1 node name in the tree, how can the duplicate nodes be removed? 

SYMPTOM
There are multiple same nodes in the TEP view. The node names are exactly the same.


CAUSE
Mostly, this case happens when a node name is longer than the defined name length. When user creates many long-named ones with the same starting name string (ex:"CompanyAdepartmentBsectionC1node", "CompanyAdepartmentBsectionC2node"). 

SOA will take the name to fit into the name format, it takes from the first few characters (say first 10 chars), the name string "CompanyAde" will be picked up for both of them. Hence, the same named nodes are created. So, try to use unique names (at least first 10 bytes).


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The source of TEPS tree holds the names of the monitored objects (servers).





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. Stop the SOA agent. 

2. Remove the directory: %ITMHOME%\TMAITM6\KD4\logs\KD4.DCA.CACHE\persist. The SOA agent is then forced to recreate this directory. 

3. Start the SOA agent back again.
