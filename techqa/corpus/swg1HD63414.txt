   surface is a cylinder.)
   2) Open the file: "Part3.CATPart" in "BBB" folder.
   Workbench: "GSD".
   (Please confirm that the surface is a square.)
   3) Close those files.
   In the case of "Design mode:
   4) Open the file: "T9466.CATProduct" in "BBB"
   folder. Workbench: "Assembly Design".
   (Please confirm that the surface of square is
   displayed.)

   20) Restart CATIA.
   In the case of "Visualization mode:
   21) Open the file: "T9466.CATProduct" in "BBB"
   folder. Workbench: "Assembly Design".
   (Please confirm that the surface of square is
   displayed by CGR.)
   22) Select "File" > "Save Management" by menu
   bar. "Save Management" dialog box is displayed.
   23) Click "Save As". "Save As" dialog box is

   THIS APAR IS CONSIDERED AS A SUGGESTION

   Incident Diagnosis:
   PS: LOADING OF DESIGN MODE AND
   VISUALIZATION MODE IS DIFFERENT.
   .
   Development Request Justification:
   New setting needs to be developed.
   .
   Concerning this issue, specific to the Visualization
   Mode, here is the explanation
   1. First, the 2 CATParts has the same name but not
   the same UUID (internal identifier).
   2. The Visualisation & Cache process is based on
   DocId. Here, we are able the retrieve a correct
   DocId for the CATPart (in the father of BBB
   directory), but we are not able to check whether
   this DocId contains the reference object of the
   instance. To do so, we need to open the document
   and solve the Instance-Reference link (that is to
   see if UUID match between Instance and
   Reference). And we cannot do such operation
   because it can lead to huge regression (one would
   need to open all the CATPart in this case,which is
   not acceptable).
   .
   There is a possiblity to develop a new setting that
   allows user to perform this check, but this will be a
   new development which cannot be done in actual
   releases as it requires a full new functionnal
   development. We invite you to follow Enhancement
   Request process to participate to this development
   definition.
