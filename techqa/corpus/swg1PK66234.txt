APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Trying to access CCRC at http://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc [http://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc]
   fails with, 'Error: Unable to connect to server at
   'http://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc' ' .
   SSL is configured for RWP in this environment, which means a
   non-ssl URL for accessing CCRC should be automatically converted
   to SSL (https:). For example, when you enter
   http://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc in the CCRC client, then
   it should be redirected to
   https://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc. [https://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc.]
   The above error occurs because the URL conversion is not working
   for CCRC, though it does work for CCWeb in this same
   environment. The CCWeb URL is converted as expected from
   http://system1/ccweb/ to https://system1/ccweb/ .
   WORKAROUND:
   When SSL is configured for RWP, you need to enter the SSL URL
   using https for accessing CCRC, such as
   https://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc. [https://southeast.us.company1.com/ccrc.]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SSL redirection is not supported in the CCRC client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  See technote titled, "Unable to connect to Change Management
   Server or Rational Web Platform when using CCRC with SSL
   redirection enabled".
