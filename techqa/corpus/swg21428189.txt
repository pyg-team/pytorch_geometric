PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If your HTTP server is not enabled for SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the "Page not found" error is displayed when you try to access a secure IBM InfoSphere™ Information Services Director WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can access a security-enabled WSDL only if your HTTP server is set up for SSL. To access the security-enabled WSDL documents that you create, you must set up SSL for your HTTP server. 

To set up SSL for IBM HTTP Server, do the steps in the following documentation:
