ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem title
   Required library, libFilePermsJNI.so, not in library search path
   .
   Problem description and business impact
   I am attempting to execute the nco_confpack for
   Products:
   IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus - 7.4.0
   V7.4.0 Fix Pack 7 - 7.4.0.7
   :/lcl/sit/apps/Tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin>./nco_confpack -list
   -server
   NCOMS_sit -user tivoli -password tme10ibm -file
   /lcl/sit/apps/Tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/JAN29.txt
   
   I keep receiving the following error:
   /lcl/sit/apps/Tivoli/omnibus_procedure_scripts/ncoms_connection_
   guard.
   sh, required library, libFilePermsJNI.so, not in library search
   path
   
   I have searched and it finds 2 of these files....
   
   :/lcl/sit/apps/Tivoli>find . -name libFilePermsJNI.so
   ./netcool/omnibus/platform/solaris2/lib64/libFilePermsJNI.so
   ./netcool/omnibus/platform/solaris2/lib/libFilePermsJNI.so
   
   
   Customer is Reporting this Issue on Solaris
   
   We are able to recreate the problem on Solaris by creating an
   external
   procedure that points to a valid script file.  Please open a new
   APAR
   for the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a possible work around, have the customer try adding -d64 to
   the
   java call in nco_confpack.  It should look like this:
   
   COMMAND="exec \"${NCO_JRE_64_32}/bin/java\" -d64 -ms32m -mx512m
   -classpath \"$CLASSPATH\" $SYS_PROPS"

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  On Solaris nco_confpack was run by the JVM in 32 bit mode.  The
   application wrapper script has been updated to  run nco_confpack
   with the JVM in 64 bit mode where appropriate.
