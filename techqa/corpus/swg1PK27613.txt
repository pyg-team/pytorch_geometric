APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the value for CPUUSER or USRNAM contains a Windows Domain
   user, which includes the backslash  " \ " character, the TSO
   parse service routine does not accept the backslash character
   unless the entire string is surrounded by single quotes, that
   is USRNAM('XXXXX\user1') is parsed correctly, but
   USRNAM(XXXXX\user1) is not parsed correctly and the resulting
   error message is IKJ56702I invalid USRNAM. The documentation
   concerning both the CPUUSER and USRNAM parameters needs to
   mention this requirement.
   In Customization and Tuning, section CPUREC in chapter 1,
   the following needs to be added under CPUUSER: After the
   last sentence add "If the value contains a backslash \
   character for a Windows Domain user id, then the entire
   character string must be enclosed by single quotes, for
   example:   CPUUSER('XXXXX/user1')
   Also this same change needs to be made in the Scheduling
   End-to-end manual, chapter 2, page 26.
   In Customization and Tuning, section USRREC in chapter 1
   the following needs to be added under USRNAM: After the
   last sentence add "If the value contains a backslash \
   character for a Windows Domain user id, then the entire
   character string must be enclosed by single quotes, for
   example:   USRNAM('XXXXX/user1').
   This same change needs to be made to the Scheduling End-to-end
   manual chapter 2 on page 28.
