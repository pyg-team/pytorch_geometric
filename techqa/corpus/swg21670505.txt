Known Issues in update (firmware 3.9-34) 

- In some cases, invalid security certificates can be uploaded to the unit. In case the LMI is no longer accessible, the user must login to the unit as the root user through a console or SSH connection, remove all pem files from the flash directory and reboot the unit. 

- Upgrading to 3.9 from 3.4 may cause the root password to change. Upgrading will also break the ability to change the root and admin password from both LMI and admin console. Follow the steps in Technote http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672103 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672103] to fix the issue. 

- NTP/TACACS menus have extra options other than enable/disable. These options do not do anything and will be removed in the next release. 

- Bond service is currently not working.

New fixes added in this update (firmware 2.18-42) 

- Corrects an issue that made it necessary to remove and then reapply power to reset the 10G NAB after installing a firmware update. 

- Upgrades to a newer version of OpenSSL. 

- Corrects an issue that caused duplicate notifications (including SNMP traps and e-mails) to be sent upon state change events. 

- Corrects an issue that could lead to system instability when using certain TACACS+ server configurations. 

- Corrected an issue where the 'link mode' heartbeat fail-over delay was longer than normal. 


Fixes previously included in update 5 (firmware 2.15-36) 

- Corrects an issue with the heartbeat receive routine, and adds new checks to prevent buffer corruption. 

- Addresses a buffer overflow in the 'updated' process. 

- Corrects an issue that prevented NTP from starting automatically after a reboot. 


Fixes previously included in update 4 (firmware 2.13-34) 

- Corrects an issue which could cause port statistics values to appear blank even when traffic is flowing. 

- Adds support for additional duplex and link speed options on the management interface. 


Fixes previously included in update 3 (firmware 2.11-28) 

- Corrects an issue in which heartbeat emitting procedures on different segments could overlap and cause a 10G NAB to go into bypass unnecessarily. 


Fixes previously included in update 2 (firmware 1.0.0343c3c) 

- A race condition has recently been discovered in the stock Proventia Network Active Bypass 10G (NAB) firmware that will cause this appliance to experience high CPU utilization. This patch implements a workaround to automatically reboot the 10G NAB when this situation is detected. 


Fixes previously included in update 1 (firmware 1.0.2919) 

- Corrects an issue that prevents this appliance from successfully passing multicast traffic.
