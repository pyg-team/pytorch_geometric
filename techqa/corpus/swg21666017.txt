QUESTION
 How can one ensure that configuring CBR-enabled status for a Property Template in FileNet Enterprise Manager applies to document subclasses in Filenet Content Engine ? 

ANSWER
After setting the CBR-enabled status for a Property Template in FileNet Enterprise Manager, if the respective property should also be indexed for child classes, the Propagate button should be clicked, followed by selecting the property that was just modified. 
For example, assume that Property1 is defined at the ParentClass level with two child classes - ChildClass1 and ChildClass2. Since Property1 is inherited by the child classes, the CBR enabled may also set individually at each document class level. Assume also that CBR-enabled was only selected at the ParentClass and ChildClass1 levels. A representation of the configuration may look like this :





CBR Enabled CBR Enabled [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] ParentClass [x] Property1 [ ] ChildClass1 [x] Property1 [ ] ChildClass2 [ ] Property1 [ ] 

In this case, only content for ParentClass and ChildClass1 will be CBR indexed, Property1 will not be indexed at all. 


If one were to access the ParentClass and enable CBR for Property1 but not propagate the change, then the configuration will look like this : 

CBR Enabled CBR Enabled [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] ParentClass [x] Property1 [x] ChildClass1 [x] Property1 [ ] ChildClass2 [ ] Property1 [ ] 

Content for ParentClass and ChildClass1 will be CBR indexed, Property1 attached to only ParentClass will also be indexed. 
Childclass2 and Property1 values attached to it will not be indexed. Property1 values attached to ChildClass1 will not be indexed. 

If one were to also click the Propagate button after setting CBR for Property1 then the following configuration would be applied : 

CBR Enabled CBR Enabled [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666017&amp;aid=1] ParentClass [x] Property1 [x] ChildClass1 [x] Property1 [x] ChildClass2 [ ] Property1 [ ] 

Content for ParentClass and ChildClass1 will be CBR indexed, Property1 attached to ParentClass and ChildClass1 will also be indexed. 
Childclass2 and Property1 values attached to it will not be indexed. 

Since ChildClass2 is not CBR enabled at the document class level, Property1 attached to it will also not be CBR Enabled. There is a requirement that the document class be CBR Enabled prior to any property template to also be CBR Enabled. 

When setting the CBR-Enabled flag for a Property Template consider whether the flag is enabled at the document class level for any or some of the child document classes and also if the change should be propagated to affect inherited Property Templates.
