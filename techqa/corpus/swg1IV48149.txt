APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNM-ITNCM Integration documentation issues:
   
   1. "Applying the integration tarball (Network Manager 3.9 only)"
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Documentation states:
   
   "
   
   Before you begin...
   - Ensure that all ncp processes are stopped.
   ...
   
   itnm_status: Use this command to check if all processes are
   running. If they are, this indicates that the tarball was
   installed successfully and connectivity has been established.
   
   "
   
   But after completing those steps, itnm_status reports ncp down
   because we were instructed to take it down earlier.
   
   
   2. "Installing the Tivoli Integrated Portal components"
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   Documentation states:
   
   "
   Log on to the Network Manager Tivoli Integrated Portal server
   as the same user who installed Network Manager, for example
   icosuser.
   
   "
   
   It is extremely unlikely ITNM/TIP was installed as icosuser as
   their documentation reccomends root, and when non-root
   installation are made it is usually with a netcool user.
   
   I also suspect that documentation should have the ITNM/TIP user
   perform ". /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/env.sh" so that the installer
   can provide default values for NCHOME and TIPHOME environment
   variable.
   
   
   3. "Installing the Tivoli Integrated Portal components"
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   Documentation states:
   
   "
   
   Enter a complete path for the installation folder location, or
   accept the default.
   Note: The default directory path is /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/ncm
   
   "
   Above will not work on a single-server installation where a
   non-root user was used to install ITNM. The non-root user will
   not have permissions to write into the
   /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/ncm directory.
   
   For this I expect the documentation needs to state a suitable
   directory for single-server installation.
   
   
   4. "Installing the customized rules for Netcool Configuration
   Manager"
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Documentation states:
   
   "
   4
   
   a. Uncomment and edit the following statement:
   
   # include"<$NCHOME>/etc/rules/include-snmptrap/<vendor>/
   <vendor>.master.include
   
   for example
   
   include "$NC_RULES_HOME/include-snmptrap/ibm/
   ibm.master.include.lookup"
   
   "
   
   In the above it is not clear whether or not we need to uncomment
   for all <vendor>, or just the ibm vendor.
   
   Also in the first line the file to uncomment ends with
   "master.include" but the example ends with
   "master.inculde.lookup. The same discrepancy exists in 4b and
   4c.
   
   
   5. "Installing the customized rules for Netcool Configuration
   Manager"
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   
   " Run the probe. If the probe was already running, force the
   probe to re-read the rules file so that the changes can take
   effect. "
   
   No details specificed on how to run probe or force it to re-read
   rules file
   
   
   6. "Preparing for device synchronization"
   -----------------------------------------
   
   Documentation states:
   
   "
   Check that the directory on the Netcool Configuration Manager
   server is correct for these three files:
   
       $INSTALL_DIR/config/properties/ssl.client.props
       $INSTALL_DIR/config/properties/sas.client.props
       $INSTALL_DIR/config/properties/wsjaas_client.conf
   "
   
   How would one "check that the directory is correct"? Should the
   documentation really be asking to check the files exist?
