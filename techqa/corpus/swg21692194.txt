Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Endpoint Manager Platform 8.2 is affected by two OpenSSL vulnerabilities and the "POODLE" vulnerability - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenSSL libraries used by IBM Endpoint Manager 8.2. Two of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to create a denial of services attack or to craft a man-in-middle attack to hijack sessions or to get sensitive information.

Attackers could also hijack a browser session to gain sensitive session information using the "POODLE" attack. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
OpenSSL advisories have been published that include two vulnerabilities that affect IBM Endpoint Manager Platform 8.2. 

The first one is a memory leak in the tls_decrypt_ticket function that allows an attacker to craft a denial of service attack by creating a session ticket that triggers an integrity-check failure.


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3567 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3567]

CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: 5.3
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) [https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2014-3567&vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C%29]

The second OpenSSL vulnerability affecting IEM Platform 8.2 is the SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability, It allows an attacker to use a man-in-the-middle attack to force the use of a weak keying material to decrypt or modify traffic between a vulnerable client and server. 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0224 [https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0224]

CVSS Base Score: 6.8
CVSS Temporal Score: 6.1
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) [https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2014-0224&vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P%29]

IEM Platform 8.2 is also vulnerable to the "POODLE" attack. The SSL 3.0 protocol, which can be used in OpenSSL, is susceptible to a padding-oracle attack. An attacker hijacking a Web browser session could gain sensitive session information through this attack. 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3566] 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: 3.7
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
