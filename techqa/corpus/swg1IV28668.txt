APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting from 623 FP1 there is a security mechanism in place
   that implements a lockout of access to SOAP server after a
   number (that can be configured with an environment variable) of
   invalid logins.
   
   This mechanism does not work on zOS systems.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Monitoring servers on z/OS do not support credential lockout.
   
   
   Starting with release 6.22 FP7 and 6.23 FP1 of the monitoring
   server, it is possible to specify the maximum number of log-on
   attempts that a user may make with any particular credential.
   If a user attempts to authenticate with an incorrect password
   more than the configuration value KDHS_MAX_FAILED_LOGINS the
   credential is locked for the time period specified by the
   configuration value KDHS_ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_PERIOD.  Unsuccessful
   attempts to log-on onto the monitoring server are counted from
   when the credential is created.  The failed attempts do not need
   to happen within a minimum time period.  There is no maximum
   time after which a failed attempt is no longer counted.  If
   either configuration value is changed, the new value is not
   applied until the monitoring server is restarted.  This feature
   was not implemented for z/OS monitoring servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Proper return code handling is now implemented in the monitoring
   server's SOAP module such that the credential lockout feature is
   now supported on all platforms, including z/OS.
