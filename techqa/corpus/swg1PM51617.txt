ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Running EJB Deploy on an EJB project with a separate EJB
   generation folder results in an 'Add to source control' dialog
   if the generated folder is under ClearCase control.
   
   Problem:
   
   1. Connect to ClearCase via the ClearCase SCM adapter
   2. Create an EJB 2.0 CMP project. During project creation,
   create another source folder (ejbdeploy), an EAR project of
   version EAR 5.0, and no EJB Client.
   3. Open the context menu on the EJB project, click on Project
   Properties. Select the tab EJB Deployment, select the source
   folder (ejbdeploy) and press OK
   4. Within the EJB project, expand the deployment descriptor -?
   Entity Beans, open the context menu, choose New -? Entity Bean,
   specify name Test and press Finish
   5. Open the context menu on the EJB project, select Java EE -?
   EJB to RDB (1.x - 2.x) Mapping -? Generate Mapping. Select
   Create a new backend folder and click Next. select Top-down and
   click Next,. Select a target database and continue through the
   dialog
   6. Select the EAR project and the EJB project, open the context
   menu and choose Team -? Share. Continue through the wizards and
   add the resources to ClearCase
   7. Open the context menu on the EJB project, select Java EE -?
   Prepare for Deployment
   
   Expected result: No pop-up appear since all files generated into
   EJB generation folder are marked as derived
   Actual result: A Pop-up appear to add the folders META-INF,
   backends, database backend name to ClearCase
   
   Local fix:

   ****************************************************************
   ClearCase is checking out the file before EJBDeploy is able
   to set the property to disable checkout of the modified
   files.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The property to disable checkout of modified files under
   ClearCase control is set when the file is created to prevent
   this error from happening.  The fix for this APAR is
   included in Rational Application Developer v8.0.4.1.
