   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF provided.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM has various issues regarding
   compare processing:
    - a problem where the input data set type (RACF database,
      UNLOAD, CKFREEZE) is confused with the input data set
      security product (can be observed on CKR0615 message);
    - programming error that can result in MSGCKR1967 while SUMMARY
      CARLa statement is being processed;
   Beside that zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM compare processing has
   been improved to have a better notion of an allocated BASE input
   set, and better definitions for the default comparison
   properties (COMAREOPT CARLa statement) as used in the zSecure
   user interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM has been adjusted in order to have
   an improved and corrected comparison processing.

   Chapter 5. CKR messages
   
   Following messages have been added:
   
   CKR2427 Automatic compare ignored for newlist type=<type> at
           <ddname> line <line>.
   Severity: 0
   Explanation: An automatic compare was specified using
                FUNCTION=BASE on an ALLOC statement, but this
                newlist type does not support an automatic compare.
                The newlist will be processed as if no
                FUNCTION=BASE was specified on an ALLOC statement.
                COMPARE_RESULT and COMPARE_CHANGES fields are
                allowed, but will return a blank value. No
                filtering will take place because of COMPAREOPT
                SHOW processing.
   User response: To explicitly request that this newlist perform
                  a compare operation, you must define your own
                  compare operation. See "Compare processing" in
                  the User Reference Manual.
   
   CKR2428 Default compare requires compare fields in newlist
           type=<type> at <ddname> line <line>.
   Severity: 12
   Explanation: A compare was specified for this newlist type using
                COMPAREOPT=DEFAULT on the NEWLIST statement.
                However, the internal knowledge base is missing
                fields to compare. To use this newlist to compare,
                create a COMPAREOPT statement that defines which
                fields to compare. You might also need to specify
                the BY and BASE fields.
   User response: See "Compare processing" in the User Reference
                  Manual for information on creating comparison
                  operations.
   
   CKR2506 Internal error: automatic compare requires compare
           fields in newlist type=<type> at <ddname> line <line>.
   Severity: 24
   Explanation: The internal knowledge base for this newlist type
                contains an inconsistency. It supports automatic
                comparison, but it has no defined fields to
                compare.
   User response: See the Electronic Support Web site for possible
                  maintenance associated with this message. If you
                  cannot find applicable maintenance, contact IBM
                  Software Support. You can still use this newlist
                  for comparing by creating a COMPAREOPT statement
                  with a correct compare specification. See
                  "Compare processing" in the User Reference Manual
                  for information on creating comparison
                  operations.
   
   CKR2507 Internal error: Default compare base field <field> not
           supported. (Only COMPLEX and SYSTEM.) Newlist
           type=<type>.
   Severity: 24
   Explanation: The internal knowledge base for this newlist type
                contains an inconsistency. The indicated field is
                defined as a base field, but only the COMPLEX and
                SYSTEM fields are allowed as base fields.
   User response: See the Electronic Support Web site for possible
                  maintenance associated with this message. If you
                  cannot find applicable maintenance, contact IBM
                  Software Support. You can still use this newlist
                  for comparing by creating a COMPAREOPT statement
                  with a correct compare specification. See
                  "Compare processing" in the User Reference Manual
                  for information on creating comparison
                  operations.
