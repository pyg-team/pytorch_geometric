APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION

   database.Imports were
   not happening from 4 days back we tried through import now

LOCAL FIX
 *  Dev is planning to include fix in SCA 1.8
   patch 1 ,
   
   Most probably the customer has an analysis that pulls too much
   data which exceeds LONGQUESTIONRESULTS limit for ResultsText.
   It may also cause problem on
   a client side since this data has to be transfers and uploaded
   to database.
