APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAM/ISAM SSL/TLS clients and servers with enabled SSL 3.0
   support might be exploited to downgrade connections to SSL 3.0,
   even if both sides of connection support higher protocols. SSL
   3.0 might demonstrate weaknesses including POODLE
   (CVE-2014-3566).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Support for the TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV cipher suite to prevent
   protocol downgrading attacks when the peer also supports
   TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV fallback protection.  Note that the client
   also needs to support if it tries to connect using a lower
   protocol version.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.13, 6.0.1.9, 7.0.0.6 and 7.1.0.4.
