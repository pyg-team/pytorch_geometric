APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A resolver trace is started dynamically by putting statement
   TRACE RESOLVER in the TCPIP.DATA file used by the application
   and issuing F RESOLVER,REFRESH.  The trace should be able to
   be turned off by removing statement TRACE RESOLVER in the
   TCPIP.DATA  file used by the application and issuing
   F RESOLVER,REFRESH.  But, this does not cause the trace to
   stop.
   .

LOCAL FIX
 *  Stop the application.  Restart the the application when
   TRACE RESOLVER is not present in the TCPIP.DATA file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the IBM Communications Server   *
   *                 for z/OS Version 1 Releases 6, 7 and 8 IP:   *
   *                 Dynamic activation and deactivation of       *
   *                 Trace Resolver                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If a long running application has had   *
   *                      the Trace Resolver facility activated   *
   *                      and then wishes to deactivate the       *
   *                      trace the trace could not be stopped.   *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Once the Trace Resolver facility was started for a long
   running application the subsequent stopping of the trace could
   not be done. This could lead to the JES spool filling and also
   used CPU cycles to capture the trace information.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Once the Trace Resolver facility had been started by the
   MODIFY RESOLVER,REFRESH command it could not be stopped.
   This was caused by the resolver incorrectly restarting the
   trace facility. The resolver has been changed to correctly
   recognize that Trace Resolver was removed from the TCPIP.DATA
   statements.
