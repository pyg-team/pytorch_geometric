QUESTION
 What is the maximum number of mailboxes that Gentran:Server can manage? (SCI68720) 

ANSWER


Gentran:Server for Windows can theoretically support approximately 4 billion (size of a 32-bit integer) mailboxes. 



The practical limitation will be much lower depending on how fast the Gentran:Server is, how fast the SQL Server is, and other factors. The more mailboxes that are created, the slower the Mailbox Client GUI will run.
