PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Content Engine Event Subscription filter expression using the PathName may not trigger as expected OnCreate 

SYMPTOM
If an event subscription is defined on the Folder class or subclass and uses a filter expression that evaluates the PathName value and triggers an OnCreate event, then the subscription may not trigger as expected. 

Using filter expression such as PathName = '/FolderA/FolderB' will return False and will not trigger the event. A filter expression such as PathName LIKE '/FolderA/FolderB%' will also fail to trigger the event and may log an exception in the p8_server_error.log indicating :

CAUSE
The PathName property for a folder is not set during the creation event. As a result, when triggering OnCreate event, the value will be Null. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The PathName property of a Folder object is available for use in an event subscription filter expression after the Folder has been created. For example, the FolderName may be used in a filter expression that triggers OnUpdate event after the folder has been created.
