Title: IBM Security Bulletin:TLS Protocol 64-bit Cipher Vulnerability in Multiple N series Products (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple N series products utilize the TLS protocol. Any system using the TLS protocol with 64-bit block ciphers that are used in long running connections are vulnerable to a birthday attack referred to as SWEET32. When exploited, the vulnerability may lead to the unauthorized disclosure of information. Multiple N series Products have addressed the applicable CVE. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
