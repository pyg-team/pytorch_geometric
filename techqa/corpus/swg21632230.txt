PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The login page for OpenPages is displayed, but with strings that appear on the page start with "ERROR:en_US:" and contain what appears to be 2 oriental characters.

 1. Using sqlplus on the OpenPages Application Server, log into the database as the OPENPAGES user. 
 2. If login is successful, restart all of the OpenPages services. 
 3. If the login is not successful:

 * Work with the DBA to restart the database listener. 
 * Using SQL*Plus on the OpenPages Application Server, log into the database as the OPENPAGES user. 
 * If login is successful, restart all of the OpenPages services. 
 * If the login is not successful, work with the DBA to determine why login sessions cannot be created. 
 * Once the OPENPAGES user can successfully log into the database from the OpenPages Application Server, restart all of the OpenPages services.
