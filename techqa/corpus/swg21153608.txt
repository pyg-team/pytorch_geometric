QUESTION
How can you disable the Java applets in the mail template in IBM Lotus Notes/Domino?

ANSWER
In order to disable the applets you need to open each view of the mail template in the Domino Designer client and disable the action bar applets back to "use HTML".
You will need to repeat this for all the views in the template, and also for the Folders: $Inbox and $Trash.

Steps to accomplish this task using the Drafts view as an example:

1. In Domino Designer open the template and open the "Drafts" view under the View category on the left.
2. Display the Action pane by selecting View > Action Pane from the menu at the top.
3. Select Edit > Properties from the menu at the top.
4. In the Web Access field on the first tab of the Action Bar properties, change 'Display' from "Using Java Applet" to "Using HTML".

Reminder: You will need to repeat this for all the views in the template, and also in the Folders: $Inbox and $Trash.
