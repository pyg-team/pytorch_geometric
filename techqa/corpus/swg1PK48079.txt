   -----------------------------
   
   When a server is configured with multiple projects, the projects
   can only be removed one at a time.
   
   When multiple projects are deleted, a prompt to "Repair Server
   Configuration" is presented that indicates that all the projects
   are being removed.
   
   But, only one project will be removed

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the v6.0 WebSphere              *
   *                 Application Server within Rational           *
   *                 Application Developer v6.0.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Only the first application is removed   *
   *                      from the server when multiple           *
   *                      applications are deleted from the       *
   *                      workspace.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If multiple applications reside in a workspace and they are
   all published to the server then when all of these
   applications are deleted from the workspace the first one
   selected is only removed.  This is visible from the server
   Console view as WebSphere Application Server will only receive
   the request to remove the first application.  All other
   applications will be removed from the workspace however they
   will still be referenced by the server and can cause errors
   upon restarting the server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  All selected applications will be traversed and removed using
   the JMX agent connection that exists between Rational
   Application Developer and WebSphere Application Server.
   The fix for this APAR is currently scheduled for inclusion in
   Rational Application Developer fixpack v6.0.1.3.
