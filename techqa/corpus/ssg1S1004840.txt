ANSWER
Overview


IBM highly encourages all clients to take advantage of the following settings to allow you and IBM to partner for your success. With the Call Home feature enabled, your system is effectively monitored 24x7x365. As an IBM client, you will enjoy faster response times, faster problem determination, and effectively reduced risk over an un-monitored system. In the future, IBM plans to use inventory report data to directly notify customers that are affected by known configuration or code issues. Please see the sections below for a more detailed explanation, followed by instructions on configuring Call Home. The configuration setup is a simple process and only take a few minutes to complete. While configuration is recommended during initial setup, this can also be completed after initial setup. Instructions detailed in this document explain how to configure and enable Call Home after initial setup. 

Call Home 

The Call Home function opens a service alert if a serious error occurs on the system, automatically sending details of the error and contact information to IBM service personnel. If the system is entitled for support, a Problem Management Record (PMR) is automatically created and assigned to the appropriate IBM service personnel. The information provided to IBM in this case is an excerpt from the event log containing the details of the error and your contact information from the system. This allows IBM service personnel to contact you and arrange service on the system. This can greatly improve the speed of problem resolution by removing the need for you to detect the error. 

Email Alert 

Automatic email alerts can be generated and sent to an appropriate client system administrator or distribution list. Email alerts are effectively the same as Call Home, but they allow you to be notified about error, warning, or informational messages when they occur, as well to receive inventory emails. You can refer to the Knowledge Center documentation for your specific IBM FlashSystem product to determine if a particular event is classified as either error, warning, or informational. Look for the notification type for each error to determine which messages you wish to receive. Maximum flexibility is provided as you can customize this based on the individual preference. 

Inventory 

Rather than reporting a problem, an email is sent to IBM that describes your system hardware and critical configuration information. Object names and other potentially sensitive information, such as IP addresses are not sent. In the future, IBM plans to use inventory report data to directly notify indicated contacts who are affected by known configuration or code issues. Please see the attached document below for a sample of what is included in an inventory email to IBM. IBM recommends that the system inventory be sent on a 1 or 7 day interval for maximum benefit.
