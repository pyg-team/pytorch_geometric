QUESTION
 Why did the IBM Spectrum Protect archives from my db-server stop working after I started using Guardium? I've installed Guardium stap on the db-server and also I run db auto discovery on the db-server. If I stop the stap still the archive fails. I've to stop the Guardium collector for the archives to run without error. Sometimes it works ok but sometimes not.

We get errors like this in IBM Spectrum Protect:
06/17/2017 12:56:11 ANS0361I DIAG: Error reading http request. 

ANSWER
The auto-discovery scanning, and probing the of db-server is causing the problem. The IBM Spectrum Protect give error if Guardium auto discovery probes it's ports. Also if you read the article below it mention this problem:

Two options to solve this problem: 
- Option 1: Run db auto discovery scan less often for example only once a month, or once week, or once a day, and take care to scan at a time when TSM/IBM Spectrum Protect archive is not done.

- Option 2: Do a scan as often you want but avoid to scan the ports that the TSM/IBM Spectrum Protect backup client use. Avoid scanning port 1500 plus additional ports used by the TSM/IBM Spectrum Protect backup client. Please check with your IBM Spectrum Protect administrator, or Database Administrator, what ports are used by the TSM/IBM Spectrum Protect backup client.
