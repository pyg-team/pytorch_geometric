Title: IBM User tasks are not shown in the My Team Performance Dashboard for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A manager using the "My Team Performance" scoreboard with IBM Business Process Manager 8.0 can only view a subset of tasks that can be viewed in prior releases. 

SYMPTOM
You can see this issue if you complete the following steps: 

 1. Log into the Order Fulfillment Demo as a manager (ofManager1). 
 2. View the My Team Performance scoreboard.


This scoreboard just shows "of Analysts" role tasks. Because the "of Managers" group also manages "of Vendors", you should see the "of Vendors" tasks too. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To allow tasks assigned directly to users to be displayed in the My Team Performance scoreboard, you can override a query definition in the 60Database.xml configuration file. Instructions for the "tasks-for-user-by-team" query definition are provided in a note in the "Problem conclusion" section of APAR JR42220 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42220]. Note: APAR JR44032 has superceeded JR42220, which was the original fix.



The query change, which is included in the APAR document, also applies to IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0. To summarize, the tasks-for-user-by-team query needs to change to the following form to allow tasks assigned directly to a user to be displayed:

<tasks-for-user-by-team>
({2}.user_id = -1 and {2}.group_id in ({1}))
or ({2}.user_id in ({0}) or abs({2}.group_id) in (
select ggm.container_group_id
from lsw_grp_grp_mem_exploded_xref ggm
where ggm.group_id in ({1})
))
</tasks-for-user-by-team> 

Consult the "Problem conclusion" section for instructions on how to modify the <tasks-for-user-by-team> query. 


Override this setting in the 100Custom.xml configuration file. The Configuration file overview and explanation for Lombardi Teamworks, WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE), and the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439614] document provides an overview of IBM Business Process Manager configuration files and how to use the 100Custom.xml file.
