Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
OPM security vulnerability SSL TLS POODLE SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager (OPM). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

DESCRIPTION: IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

Detailed instructions are available here: “Updating the [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640535]IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640535] for InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640535]”. 


For OPM versions 5.2 through 5.3.1, installing the Interim Fix changes the web console server configuration so that it disables the SSLv3 protocol and permits only TLS 1.0 or higher for HTTPS connections. 

After installing the Interim Fix, if you need to re-enable the SSLv3 protocol, edit the server.xml file that is located in the InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager installation directory:


 * 


Remove the following line and then save the file: 
 * 


A restart is not required for this change to take effect.  


IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager (OPM) relies on IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) to manage the SSL protocol used for secure network connections. Older OPM versions (4.1 through 5.1.1.1) use WAS Smash, newer OPM versions (since 5.2) use WAS Liberty Profile. 

For more details, see the Workarounds and Mitigations section in this document Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]. 

The following steps outline how to apply these mitigations to OPM 5.2 through 5.3.1.

Edit the SSLConfig.xml file to specify the default SSL configuration to be used by IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager. The SSLConfig.xml file is located in the InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager installation directory: 

 * 
 * wlp/usr/servers/dsweb/SSLConfig.xml
 * 

Before making any changes the contents of the SSLConfig.xml file should look like this:  * 
 * <server>
 * 
 * <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="password"/>
 * 
 * </server>


A 'ssl' element can be added to specify the minimal level of security for the SSL protocol. Setting the 'sslProtocol' attribute to ”TLS” ensures that SSLv3 will no longer be used. 

After making these changes, the contents of the SSLConfig.xml file may look like this:  * 
 * <server>
 * 
 * <ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" 
 * 
 *  keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore"
 * 
 *  sslProtocol="TLS" />
 * 
 * <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="password"/>
 * 
 * </server>


If an 'ssl' element already exists, ensure that it includes the attribute sslProtocol="TLS" . There is no need to modify the 'keyStore' entry, if you have customized it, for example to point to your own key store location, you can retain the entry as is. It is not required to restart the web console server after this update. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
