PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 JavaScript Example: Custom JavaScript function to replace a string with a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following JavaScript executes a case-insensitive global search for the string in <find> and replaces it with a carriage return and line feed (CRLF). This custom JavaScript can be useful when formatting data. 
To use the custom JavaScript, replace the string <find> with the desired string that needs to be replaced with a carriage return and line feed. Then paste the code into the Cast Iron Studio Custom Function window. Test the function with some test data and verify the results.

JavaScript code:

instr=instr.replace(/<find>/gi, "\r\n");
return instr

Example: 
Input string = 'Cast-Iron'
<find>= '-'
Output result string: 
Cast
Iron
