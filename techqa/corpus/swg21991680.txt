Q1. Does IBM Notes support Apple's macOS Sierra (aka OS X 10.12)? 
IBM Notes 9.0.1 64-bit running 9.0.1 Interim Fix 5 or above supports macOS Sierra and OS X 10.11. IBM recommends applying the latest Fix Pack and Interim Fix available to benefit from the latest features and enhancements. 


As was announced in Q4 2015 in the following technical document, Notes 9.0.1 Mac 32-bit is not supported with newer Mac operating systems, including macOS Sierra: Statement of Direction: Recommended client for Mac 64-bit is Notes 9.0.1 64-bit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21971524] 
For the purposes of this technote, OS X 10.12 will be referred to as macOS Sierra throughout the remainder of this document. 


Q2. What versions of Notes are supported on macOS Sierra? 

 * IBM Notes 9.0.1 64-bit released in Fall of 2015 running 9.0.1 Interim Fix 5 released September 30, 2016 supports macOS Sierra and OS X 10.11 with Oracle JRE 1.8. Prior releases, including IBM Notes 9.0.1.x 32-bit and Notes 8.5.x, are not supported.

 * IBM Client Application Access (ICAA) 1.0.0.1 Feature Pack 1 due out in November 2016 will support macOS Sierra. ICAA for Mac 64-bit is a lightweight solution that helps clients who want to move to a browser-based interface for email (IBM SmartCloud Notes web, IBM Verse, or iNotes), while continuing to work with existing Notes and Domino applications on-premises.



Q3. I'm already at Notes 9.0.1 64-bit, where can I download 9.0.1 Interim Fix 5 or higher? 
See this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963] for a list of fixes and download links for Notes 9.0.1 64-bit Interim Fixes 


Q4. Can I install Notes 32-bit 9.0.1.x or earlier on a Mac running macOS Sierra? 
No. IBM Notes 9.0.1.x 32-bit will not function on macOS Sierra. 


Q5. If I am running Notes 32-bit, what steps can I take to work with macOS Sierra ? 
Install Notes 9.0.1 64-bit + 9.0.1 Interim Fix 5 for Mac. This release can be installed and is supported on macOS Sierra and OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). IBM Notes 9.0.1 64-bit for Mac also requires Oracle JRE 1.8 or higher. 

 * Instructions to move from Notes 32-bit to 64-bit
 *  Step 1: Uninstall 32-bit Notes 9.0.1. The 32-bit version must be uninstalled first. Attempting to install 64-bit will prompt users to uninstall 32-bit version of Notes first. To uninstall, run the uninstall program using either the 9.0.1 32-bit package or the 9.0.1 64-bit package, which contains an uninstall program. 
 *  Step 2: Install 64-bit Notes 9.0.1: You can install Notes either before upgrading to macOS Sierra or after. Step 3: Install 64-bit Notes 9.0.1 Interim Fix 5
