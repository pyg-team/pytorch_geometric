Text:
5724V09ORTR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 No data is displayed in TEPS for Alert Log for the Oracle Extended Agent. 

SYMPTOM
All data is collected by the Oracle Extended Agent except the Alert log Summary. The Oracle Agent client log (hostname_productcode_krzclient_HEXtimestamp-nn.log) will have following error: 

 "Search file /home/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/instance/instance/trace/alert_instance.log initialization failed, errno 13:Permission denied."


CAUSE
The user that starts the agent does not have read permission to the Oracle Alert log. This issue only occurs on Unix/Linux platforms.



ENVIRONMENT
Unix/Linux



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The user that runs the agent must have read access to the Alert log. Use chmod command to grant read permission to the user and then restart the agent.
