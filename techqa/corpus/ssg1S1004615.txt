SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited. Authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91990 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Products VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix 9840-AE1,
9843-AE1,
9846-AE1,
9848-AE1, A code fix is now available, the VRMF of this code level is 1.1.1.3 N/A No work arounds or mitigations, other than applying this code fix, are known for this OpenSSL vulnerability 9846–AC0,
9848–AC0, A code fix is now available, the VRMF of this code level is 7.2.0.5 N/A No work arounds or mitigations, other than applying this code fix, are known for this OpenSSL vulnerability 
After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160. 

1) Replace your SSL Certificates. 

Regenerate the system's SSL certificate and associated private key by issuing the command-line interface (CLI) command "svctask chsystem -regensslcert". 

2) Reset User Credentials 

Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate. Change all user passwords using either the graphical user interface (GUI) or by issuing the CLI command "svctask chcurrentuser -password". No action is necessary for session-related cookies.

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
