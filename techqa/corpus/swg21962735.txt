QUESTION
 How to install Information Server 11.3 on 32-bit Windows machines. 

ANSWER
Information Server 11.3 currently has no 32-bit version for Client on Windows machines. Since many customers are still running Windows 32-bit, Product Management is working internally in order to approve a 32-bit build of the code. However there is no estimation of when this is going to happen. 


In the meantime, the recommedation is to go ahead and install the 64-bit version running the setup program via command line along with -force option. 


The installation will run and during the pre-requisite check it will fail when checking for supported platform. 


At the bottom of the page, next to Save Report button, check "Ignore FAILED items and continue?" and click next to continue with the installation.
