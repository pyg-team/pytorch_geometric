QUESTION
 Does the Information Server AppServerAdmin -db option change the XMETA username in addition to the password specified? 

ANSWER
Yes. Although it is not recommended to change the XMETA user name via the AppServerAdmin -db option, it will update the user name to the value specified on the AppServerAdmin -db command. When using the AppServerAdmin command, the userid and password specified will be saved in the appropriate IS and WAS configuration files. 

 

The current documentation indicates that you should "not change the user name by using this command" but what is not mentioned is that if you specify a different user name for the XMETA user name, it will get changed. 


You must not specify a new user name for the metadata repository using this command. The user name must match the schema of the database so cannot be simply changed here.
