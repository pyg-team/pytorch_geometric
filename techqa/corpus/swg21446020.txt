## InstallAnywhere variables to configure for silent
## uninstall 
## 
## Usage: undo[.exe] -f <full path to this file>
## 
## On Windows, undo.exe will return immediately. To avoid
## this, you should wrap the uninstall.exe command in a
## batch file.
## The uninstall program has no extension on Unix
## platforms. 
## 
## Do not use -i silent option, as the INSTALLER_UI property 
## below sets silent mode.
## If you see the GUI panel after running uninstall, it
## means that -f parameter is not valid. Stop uninstalling,
## check -f parameter and start again.

-------------------------------------------------------------

The installer cannot run on your configuration. It will now quit.

The reason why the above test failed with the statement "The installer cannot run..." is because user id and password were not provided in the response file. This example was purely for demonstration purposes. If the correct username and password are supplied, then uninstall will complete.
