PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After migration from Cognos 8.3 to Cognos 8.4 users from “Analysis Users” and “Consumer” roles could access these dashboards but users from “Analysis Users” role were experiencing some slowness issues in “Analysis Studio”. 

SYMPTOM
Users from “Analysis User” role were experiencing performance issues navigating on Analysis Studio cubes. 

They don’t have problems accessing saved Analysis Studio reports. It can be opened correctly in Cognos Viewer. Users from “Author” role have no problems.


CAUSE
From the original package, customer had some dashboards reports with HTML Items. Users from “Analysis Users” and “Consumer” roles that would need to see these HTML Items were getting an error informing that they didn’t have permissions to use HTML Items.

To fix this issue, users from “Analysis Users” and “Consumer” roles were added to “Report Studio” Capabilities with “Traverse” and “Execute” permissions. The same was made for “HTML Items in Reports”. 

With these settings users from “Analysis Users” and “Consumer” roles were able to access these reports in Cognos 8.3. 

After migration from Cognos 8.3 to Cognos 8.4 users from “Analysis Users” and “Consumer” roles could access these dashboards but users from “Analysis Users” role were experiencing some slowness issues in “Analysis Studio”.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
We need to change some permission for “Report Studio” capabilities and some of its components. 


These are the additional permissions we had to grant to the users:

Report Studio Capabilities:
Role: “Analysis User” and “Consumer” 
Permission: Traverse

HTML Items in Report (from Report Studio Capabilities)
Role: “Analysis User” and “Consumer” 
Permissions: Read, Execute, Traverse

All others Report Studio Capabilities:
Inherit permissions from “Report Studio” capabilities.
