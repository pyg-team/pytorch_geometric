Title: IBM XML parser error while trying to save to the database - United States

Text:
import export report post-processing script Oracle DB2 failed TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Whenever I save a particular item (or category) in the user interface or try to use it in a job, I get XML parser errors; other data objects are fine. Why am I getting this error and how can I correct it? 

CAUSE
The application places very few restrictions on what type of data can be used with the software. But while saving special characters like &, $, √ê etc... to the database, it is essential that these characters are first converted into database compatible format, for example and may need to be converted to "&amp;". If such a conversion does not take place, then the invalid format can result in an unreadable character causing data corruption.

ANSWER
The application creates an XML copy of all the items and categories before committing the save operation in the database. If an item (or category) contains an unreadable character, then trying to save that item will result in an XML parser error as shown below:
Caused by: Error processing xml queue. m_xmlPendingQueue contained at time of failure: []

Follow these steps to correct the data corruption for an item:
1. Open the item in the single edit screen.
2. Browse the item attributes for special characters.
3. Remove the special character and try to save the item. If the save operation completes, then there is no further corruption and you may proceed to step 6. 
4. If you can't save the item, then repeat step 2 and 3 till all the special characters have been accounted for.
5. If you remove all special characters and still can't save the item, then delete it and create a new one with identical information.
6. If you were able to successfully save the item, then add all the special characters back to the item attributes and save the item for one last time.
Follow similar steps for a category.

Note: The application can support most special characters and a correctly saved special character will not cause this error. The root cause of the error is that the character was not saved properly in the database leading to an unreadable database entry. This could be due to a number of reasons including an exception while trying to perform the save operation, the database not being stable etc.
