DEFINITIONS
Regression: An error in the Maintenance Delivery Vehicle [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] (MDV) that produces incorrect or unexpected behavior causing a supported feature to stop functioning as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Coding errors that cause a regression
 * Documentation or packaging problems that cause a regression
 * Errors reported in a new function delivered in a MDV that cause a regression

Incomplete: An error in the MDV has not regressed, but does not work as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Fixed APARs which did not solve the original problem but did not break anything new
 * APARs reporting documentation errors, such as readme errors, that cause problems applying an MDV but do not lead to a regression




Notes:  * Regression and incomplete APARs are considered fix-in-error or MDV-in-error
 * Definitions above apply only to valid APARs that result in product fixes (APARs returned as working-as-designed are not assessed for being fix-in-error)
 * Issues in major releases due to new functionality do not apply in this definition

There are no known regressions to report.

HELPFUL HINTS FOR OBTAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:
Before you contact IBM Rational Software Support, gather the background information that you need to describe the problem. When you describe a problem to an IBM software support specialist, be as specific as possible and include all relevant background information so that the specialist can help you solve the problem efficiently. To save time, know the answers to these questions: 

 * What software versions were you running when the problem occurred? 
 * Do you have logs, traces, or messages that are related to the problem? 
 * Can you reproduce the problem? If so, what steps do you take to reproduce it? 
 * Is there a workaround for the problem? If so, be prepared to describe the workaround. 

If you have helpful information to diagnose or identify the problem on your system, you can provide this data by following the instructions to exchange information with IBM Technical Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html].
