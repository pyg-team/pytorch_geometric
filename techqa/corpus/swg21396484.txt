PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
TEP Playback Status workspace shows that the playback is running, but the AMC and RRT TEMA workspaces (Applications and Transactions) don't show any data. 

CAUSE

Users often create new Client definitions to meet specific reporting needs. 

If this process is not managed carefully, a situation can arise where one or more monitors running in the environment do not report data because the computer they are running on does not match the pattern of any Clients defined in AMCE. This can happen even when there are valid transactions running on that computer.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * ITCAM for Transactions 7.x is supplied with a single default client group named "All Clients" that uses the IP filter value *.
   
   Check the Agent Configuration workspace (right-click Robotic Response Time > Workspaces > Configuration) to make sure "All Clients" is listed.
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21396484&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21396484&aid=1]
   
   If you don't see the "All Clients" row with IP *, you need to use AMCE to create the filter as described in "Resolving the problem".
   __________
   
 * If the row does exist you should check the RRT/T6 Agent file system to make sure the file:
   [ITM_HOME]\tmaitm6\camconfig\T6\clients\clients.xml 
   exists and has the correct content.
   
   The default content of this file is:
   
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><clients>
   <clientgroup>
   <name>All Clients</name>
   <desc>Default client group which matches all clients.</desc>
   <filters>
   <filter>
   <name>IP</name>
   <value>*</value>
   <type>include</type>
   </filter>
   </filters>
   <reporting>
   <property>
   <name>ClientName</name>
   <value>All Clients</value>
   </property>
   </reporting>
   </clientgroup>
   </clients>
   
   If you don't see this, you need to use AMCE to create or update the filter as described in "Resolving the problem".
   __________
   
 * Look for "ARM_*.dat" files on the T6 RRT agent under [ITM_HOME]/arm/log/kt6
   
   If the files are missing, you should Enable ARM debug tracing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/rt/TSG/itcam_rt_rrt_206865_fix.html]
   
   Then check the contents of trace-debug.log for the message "Ignoring transaction because it did not match a client definition".
   
   For example:
   
   2009-08-11 07:58:27.079:843:946 (3012:1540) - This is an edge transaction.
   Testing transaction against profiles, transaction properties are:
   = 
   AgentType = T6
   ApplicationGroup = IBM Rational Functional Test
   ApplicationInstance = 
   ApplicationName = RFT_WRTPlants01
   Hostname = cam71-rpt1
   IP = 192.168.219.208
   IPV4ClassASubNet = 192*
   IPV4ClassBSubNet = 192.168*
   IPV4ClassCSubNet = 192.168.219*
   IPV6 = 192.168.219.208
   ServerName = cam71-rpt1
   TransactionName = RFT_WRTPlants01
   URI = 
   2009-08-11 07:58:27.080:006:228 (3012:1540) - ENTER ConfigManager::find(..)
   2009-08-11 07:58:27.080:149:484 (3012:1540) - Transaction matched Transaction Definition [RFT_WRTPlants01RFT_WRTPlants01] Testing against client patterns
   2009-08-11 07:58:27.080:278:772 (3012:1540) - Ignoring transaction because it did not match a client definition.
   
   If you've got this far in the technote without being directed to "Resolving the problem" or you still have the problem after trying the solution, you should now read the technote RRT Data not showing in TEP [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499269] where other possible causes of RRT/T6 data problems are described.
   
   If you open a Problem Management Records (PMRs) make sure you state the outcome of the armdebug tracing.
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Data from robotic playbacks need to match a filter for it to be written to "dat" files for display in the TEP and Historical Data collection. 


So, "no filter or incorrect filter" = "no data".

Perform the following steps in the TEP console to create a new "All Clients" group:


 1. Open Application Management Configuration Editor (AMCE)
    
 2. Use the pull down to navigate to "Clients"
    
 3. Click on the "Create New Client Group" icon
    
 4. Enter a "Client name" of: "All Clients"
    
 5. Click on the "Filter" tab and click "Add"
    
 6. In the "Filter" popup enter the following Filter Information:
    Name: IP
    Value: *
    Type: Include
    
 7. Click OK to close AMCE
    

A new "Clients.xml" file should automatically be distributed to the RRT/T6 agent and subsequent playbacks should now have data that matches the new filter. 

Even in an environment where specific Client group filters are defined, it's always good practice to keep the "All Clients" filter as this acts as a "catch all" for data that doesn't match other filters. 

You can find more information relating to the collection and display of data from robotic playbacks in the technote ITCAM for Transactions - RRT (KT6) Agent Data Collection [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21385388]
