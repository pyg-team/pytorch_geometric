PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While re-installing WebSphere Partner Gateway in distributed mode using the same deployment manager, a few problems arise, which are detailed in the following sections.


SYMPTOM
The WebSphere Partner Gateway servers do not federate to the cell, resulting in the following addNode.log errors: 

ADMU0507I: No servers found in configuration under: /opt/IBM/bcghub-distrib/wasND/Profiles/bcgprofile/config/cells/bcgCell/nodes/bcgnode_<host name>/servers
ADMU2010I: Stopping all server processes for node bcgnode_<host name>
ADMU0024I: Deleting the old backup directory.
ADMU0015I: Backing up the original cell repository.
ADMU0012I: Creating Node Agent configuration for node: bcgnode_<host name>
ADMU0014I: Adding node bcgnode_<host name> configuration to cell:
dmgrCell
ADMU0027E: An error occurred during federation Invalid keystore format; rolling
back to original configuration.
ADMU0211I: Error details may be seen in the file


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The work around for this problem is as follows: 

 1. Stop the Deployment manager 
 2. Rename trust.p12 and key.p12, which is present in:
    <dmgr_install_dir>\wasND\Profiles\bcgdmgr\config\cells\wpgCell 
 3. Start the Deployment manager and proceed with the installation.


OR 

Re-install the deployment manager.
