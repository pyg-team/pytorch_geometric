APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The configuration settings Number of trace files and Size limit
   in MB that are used by BM Content Collector P8 Content Search
   Services Support and that can be configured in the IBM Content
   Collector Configuration Manager have no effect if the log level
   is set to Information. Log files are not limited in size and
   only one log file is created to which entries are appended
   during each indexing iteration. Only when log level is set to
   Trace, the values that are defined for Number of trace files and
    Size limit in MB are used.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The configuration settings Number of trace files and Size limit
   in MB that are used by BM Content Collector P8 Content Search
   Services Support and that can be configured in the IBM Content
   Collector Configuration Manager have no effect if the log level
   is set to Information. Log files are not limited in size and
   only one log file is created to which entries are appended

   Trace, the values that are defined for Number of trace files and
    Size limit in MB are used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0.2 LA005 and 4.0.0 Fix
   Pack 3, IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Services Support
    was changed to enable defining and using these configuration
   settings when log level is set to Information.
