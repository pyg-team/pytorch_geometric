AES 256-bit f PCI DSS IBMJCEFIPS and IBMJCEPlusFIPS crypto TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 
SKLM uses AES 256-bit for data encryption/decryption to conform to the PCI DSS standards. 
Is a third party used to review IBM's implementation / code of encryption / decryption. Are there any outstanding deficiencies identified by the third party ? 


ANSWER

From SKLM perspective , it uses IBM JAVA to do encryption.

IBM Java has two cryptographic providers, IBMJCEFIPS and IBMJCEPlusFIPS which are FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic modules which have been reviewed by an external FIPS 140-2 certification lab and certified by an external third party agency via the CMVP process. 
Internal reviews are also done on our crypto code and the resulting product, SKLM, undergoes penetration testing including the cryptography. 
Please refer to the security policies for IBMJCEFIPS and IBMJCEPlusFIPS. 

There are no known deficiencies in the cryptographic code.
