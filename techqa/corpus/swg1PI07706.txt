APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Number of SMF data sets found using the SMF_DSN_MASK value is
   limited to 512, which may be too small a number in some
   circumstances. If a customer was relying on an existing set of
   SMF data sets as input to the AUIFSTC task, and there were more
   than 512 of these data sets in the z/OS catalog, data sets 513
   and above would not be considered for use, and the AUIFSTC
   tasks would return the "AUIF501I--NO NEW CATALOGED SMF DATA
   SETS FOUND FOR SMF MASK:" message, when in fact,
   new data sets did exist.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This ZAP will allow  for up to 4095 data sets to be returned and
   considered for use.
   It should be applied to the SAUILOAD data set.
