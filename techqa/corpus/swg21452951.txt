 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Not able to generate postmortem logs with error "ERROR: ftpFile is not valid at /usr/ironhide/libexec/cli/postmortem_export.pl" with Cast Iron 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Attempts to export the generated postmortem file to an ftp server is failing with ERROR: ftpFile is not valid at /usr/ironhide/libexec/cli/postmortem_export.pl

This error message appears if you are using any special character (example '&') in password. For example, the following command will fail:
debug postmortem export ftp 10.10.0.30 user castironftp passwd 3&r0v3r file Test_Postmortem.tgz

The special characters get interpreted differently by the script.
You should use an ftp account without any special character in passwords.
