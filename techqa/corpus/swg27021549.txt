WEB APPLICATION SERVERS (IBM CMIS FOR FILENET CONTENT MANAGER SERVER)
The following table specifies the supported web application servers for the IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager server.

Recommendation: It is strongly recommended that you install IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager to a dedicated application server or application server cluster. IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager server and Content Platform Engine server should not be deployed in the same JVM or application server cluster. Deploy the servers as close as possible with respect to network latency because of the amount of traffic between the two. For example, installing and deploying the IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager web application to a separate application server profile on the same web container physical machine with Content Platform Engine removes network traffic between them increases performance for IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager clients.

Web application server AIX Linux Windows Notes WebSphere Application Server 7 (64-bit) 
Minimum version: 7.0.0.9 
Base or Network Deployment only Supported on AIX [http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/icons/confirm.gif] Supported on Linux [http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/icons/confirm.gif] Supported on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/icons/confirm.gif] WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.9 and 7.0.0.11 users: 
It is recommended that you use Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) to add and access large objects through IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager Web Services. If you use a method other than MTOM to add or access large objects through IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager, WebSphere Application Server might run out of heap space and hang. 

 Contact WebSphere Application Server Support to obtain the appropriate fix for WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.9 or 7.0.0.11. 

 This fix is included in WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.13.

Database Notes IBM DB2 Database for Linux, Unix, and Windows Version 9.7 FP x 

Editions: Workgroup, Express, and Enterprise 
Minimum version: Base Oracle 11g Release 2, 11.2.0.x 
Editions: Enterprise wth Standard, Standard One includes RAC

IBM FILENET CONTENT ENGINE CLIENT (IBM CMIS FOR FILENET CONTENT MANAGER SERVER)
 The Content Engine Client enables IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager to communicate with the IBM FileNet Content Manager server. You must install the version of the Content Engine Client that is included with the version of the Content Engine to which you are connecting. 

 It is recommended that you install the Content Engine Client after you install IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager because you must add the Content Engine Client API files to the IBM CMIS installation directory. 

 However, if the Content Engine Client is already installed on the machine when you install IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager, you must run the Content Engine Client installation program again to add the Content Engine Client API files to the IBM CMIS installation directory. 

 For more information for installing IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager and the Content Engine Client, see Installing IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/topic/com.ibm.installingp8cmis.doc/cmiin000.htm] in the information center.

SIZING AND CAPACITY PLANNING
 IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager requires a minimum of: 

 * Disk space: 200 MB
 * Memory: 1 GB

The amount of necessary CPU processing power, RAM, and disk space vary depending on your specific workload and your desired system capacity and performance. To build the best working system for your needs, build a test system and then move the system into production after you verify that it meets your needs.
