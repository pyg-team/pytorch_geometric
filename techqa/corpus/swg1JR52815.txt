ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enhance the currently available  show all  button. This
   option currently limits the number of entries, that are
   displayed on the page. It does not limit the resultset queried
   from the database.  E.g when you today specify zero entries to
   be displayed, the page still would not come up because the
   query is still processed and would run into a timeout.
   
     A WTRN00006W is logged along with the accompanying
   [8/3/16 15:17:39:778 CST] 0000004d TimeoutManage I   WTRN0124I:
   When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction
   is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[server.startup
   : 2,5,main].
   The
   stack trace of this thread when the timeout occurred was:
    java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)
    java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:164)
    java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:134)
   ...

   (WSJdbcPreparedStatement.java:804)
    com.lombardisoftware.server.scheduler.BlackoutCalendarUtils$2.e
   xecute(BlackoutCalendarUtils.java:123)
   
   We suggest that when 0 is specified the query is not executed at
   all. This can be implemented and delivered on the maintenance
   stream.
