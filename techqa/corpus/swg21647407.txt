QUESTION
 Is Microsoft Failover Clustering (formerly Microsoft Cluster Services) supported with Datacap Taskmaster? 

ANSWER
Microsoft Failover Clustering is supported with Datacap Taskmaster with the following conditions: 

 * Failover Clustering is only supported with the Taskmaster Server service, not Taskmaster Web, Rulerunner, or any other service. 
 * IBM does not provide any documentation on how to set up or configure Failover Clustering for use with Datacap Taskmaster. 
 * Datacap should be installed on the local drive of each Taskmaster server, not on the clustered drive. 
 * IBM recommends Failover Clustering as one option for providing Taskmaster Server failover capability as part of a high availability system. Multiple Datacap Taskmaster 8.1 Servers can be load balanced using standard network appliances, which also provides high availability.
