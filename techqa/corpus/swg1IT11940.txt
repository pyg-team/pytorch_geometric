APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running MQ Explorer on MQ 7.5 to create CHLAUTH records, it
   is observed that the IPPROCS and OPPROCS count increase for
   SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE with every new CHLAUTH record.
   
   The Queue status shows that these handles belong to command
   server process (amqpcsea). This is not an expected behavior as
   the handle count for SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE should not
   increase with every CHLAUTH record created from MQ Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the queue manager's command server to release the
   accumulated handles
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users who use MQ Explorer or the MQ classes for PCF to create
   channel authentication (CHLAUTH) records
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When handling a request to create a new CHLAUTH record, the
   queue manager's command server process (amqpcsea) creates MQ
   object handles in order to access the SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE.
   When the command server processed a request to create a CHLAUTH
   record from MQ Explorer or the MQ classes for PCF, these handles
   were not correctly released on completion of the operation.
   This would be seen as an increase in the IPPROCS and OPPROCS
   count on the SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE.
   
   When creating a new CHLAUTH record using the runmqsc console,
   the handles were released correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ code has been modified to appropriately release queue handles
   after a new CHLAUTH record is created using MQ Explorer or the
   MQ classes for PCF.
