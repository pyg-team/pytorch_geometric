APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Single Signon Option (SSO) information is not included
   in tep.jnlp file so SSO does not work for WebStart. This may
   also be true of the TEP Browser.
   .
   Environment:
     Unix and Windows.
     TEPS configured for Single Signon Option and using a Domain ID
     to logon.
   .
   Problem Description:
     If the following line is not part of tep.jnlp file a default
     domain of ibm.com is returned. If the line is present the
     value (domain) is returned.
     <property name="cnp.cookie.domain" value="domain_name"/>
     This line may also have to be added to applet.html for SSO to
     work correctly for the TEP Browser.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     Configure TEPS to use single signon option and try to use a
     domain ID to signon TEPS.
     Try both WebStart, TEP Browser and TEP Desktop. All should
     work.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix:
     Add the above  <property name...> line (be sure to change
     domain_name to the correct domain value) to the applet.html
     file and the tep.jnlpt file so configuration of TEPS will
     render the value in the tep.jnlp file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  LDAP SSO information is missing from tep.jnlp.
   
   
   When the portal server is configured to use Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) with Single Sign-On (SSO),
   login to the portal client via Java Web Start is not successful.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to include the property value required for
   Java Web Start logins to work properly.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0009
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Edit CANDLEHOME/<platform>/cw/tep.jnlp and add the
   following property value:
   
      <property name="cnp.cookie.domain" value="domain_name"/>
   
   For "domain_name", specify the LDAP SSO domain that was used
   for the TEPS configuration.  The value should be the same as
   that for KFW_LDAP_SSO_DOMAIN in CANDLEHOME/config/cq.config.
