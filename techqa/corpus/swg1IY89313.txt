ERROR DESCRIPTION

   **********************************************
   Title: Request is not correctly listed when "Suspend User",
   "Restore User" or "Delete User" is selected in View Completed
   Requests.
   
   Problem Description:
   Request isn't correctly listed when "Suspend User", "Restore
   User" or "Delete User" is selected in "View Completed Requests".
   
   This phenomena occurs under Japanese language installed. This
   can't see under English environment.
   
   In English environment, there are six filters that are related
   to operations to user as follows:-
   
   - "Suspend User"
   - "Suspend Users"
   - "Restore User"
   - "Restore Users"
   - "Delete User"
   - "Delete Users"
   
   On the other hand, there are only three filters that are related
   to "User(s)" operations....  The reason is that Japanese doesn't
   Have any word to distinguish "User" from "Users".
   
   Can Customer Recreate:
   Yes, and Japan L2 regenerated.
   
   ITIM Server Version - 4.6 with FP21
   
   Server Environment
   Operating System   : AIX5.3
   Database server    : DB2 V8.1
   Directory server   : IDS 6.0
   Application Server : WebSphere V5.1
   
   Desired Behavior:
   "Suspend User", "Restore User" or "Delete User" filter should
   work correctly.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   1) Install Japanese language using Language Support CD-Rom
   2) Select Japanese from language selector
   3) Login to ITIM
   4) Create a person
   5) Suspend the person
   6) Restore the person
   7) Delete the person
   8) Go to filter setting of "View Completed Requests", then set
      "Today" and "All Users".
   9) On "View Completed Request", set "All" filter
   10) Make sure that two completed requests above are listed.
   11) Change the filter to "Suspend User", then make sure whether
       the "Delete User" request is listed.
       "Delete User" request should be there, but no request is
       listed.
   12) Check the same thing to "Restore User" and "Delete User".

LOCAL FIX
 *  S17551
   We have successfully reproduced the problem in our local ITIM
   4.6 setup.
   
   For Japanese language, the translation for "Suspend User" and
   "Suspend Users" are same.
   Therefore while displaying the filters for user, ITIM displays
   only one "Suspend User".  The reason for this is as follows:
   
   In Labels.properties file the key for  "Suspend User" is
   "processType.US" and for "Suspend Users" is
   "processType.MS". Therefore two entries are displayed in drop
   down box. But, in case of Japanese language
   pack values for both  process types are same in
   labels_ja.properties. Therefore  only one value is displayed
   to user as ITIM processes only unique names.
   
   As the same key is used for both process types, Internally ITIM
   processes  only one value corresponding to both
   process types. In this case  "suspend user"/"processType.MS" and
   therefore only entries  for "suspend users' are
   displayed in completed or pending  request tab.
   Same case is applicable for other process types like "Delete
   Users" and "Restore Users".
   
   
   A temporary workaround for this issue is to use unique values
   for such key/value  pairs in Labels_ja.properties for e.g  the
   customer can differentiate the "Suspend Users" from "Suspend
   User" by editing the above mentioned property to have a
   value like "Suspend User(Multiple)"   in Japanese language. Same
   workaround can be applied for other labels also
   (Restore Users and Delete Users).
   
   
   processType.MS =Suspend User(Multiple)
   processType.US =Suspend User
