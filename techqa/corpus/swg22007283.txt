AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS

IBM Rational ClearQuest, versions 8.0 and 9.0 in the following components:


 * ClearQuest Web/CQ OSLC server/CM Server component, when configured to use SSL. 
 * ClearQuest Eclipse clients that use Report Designer, run remote reports on servers using secure connections, or use the embedded browser to connect to secure web sites. If you do not use the ClearQuest Eclipse client in this way, then you are not affected.

ClearQuest version Status 9.0.1, 9.0.1.1 Affected 9.0 through 9.0.0.5 Affected 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.15 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to install a fix that includes an updated Java™ Virtual Machine with fixes for the issues, and to apply fixes for WebSphere Application Server (WAS).

ClearQuest Web/CQ OSLC Server/CM Server Component


 1. Determine the WAS version used by your CM server. Navigate to the CM profile directory (either the profile you specified when installing ClearQuest, or <clearquest-home>/cqweb/cqwebprofile), then execute the script: bin/versionInfo.sh (UNIX) or bin\versionInfo.bat (Windows). The output includes a section "IBM WebSphere Application Server". Make note of the version listed in this section. 
 2. Review the following WAS security bulletin:
