Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 BIND is used by Power Hardware Management Console (HMC). HMC has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3136 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3136]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of query requests when using DNS64 with "break-dnssec yes" option. By sending a specially crafted DNS request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124516 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124516] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3137 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3137]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of a query response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records in an unusual order. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124517 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124517] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3138]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to the processing of control channel commands. By sending a specially crafted command, a remote attacker with access to the BIND control channel could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124518 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124518] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-3139 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3139]
DESCRIPTION: BIND on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a DNSSEC validation flaw. By sending a specially-crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125766 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125766] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3142 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3142]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error when an attacker can send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name. By sending a specially crafted request packet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass TSIG authentication on AXFR requests and transfer the target zone.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3143 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3143]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error when an attacker can send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass TSIG authentication and manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
