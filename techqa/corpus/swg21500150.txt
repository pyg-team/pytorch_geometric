Title: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture Client Service is not processing batches - United States

Text:
batches started processing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Datacap Taskmaster Client Service has a started status, but is not processing any batches. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First, review the following logs for errors, warnings and other information around the incident time. 

 * Datacap Taskmaster Client Service logs 
 * Batch logs 
 * Windows Application and System Event logs


If the logs do not immediately show the root cause, ensure the following scenarios do not apply:  * Login ID and station ID used by the client service have insufficient permissions, including user/group Client(s) permissions, Taskmaster Sub (Client Service) permissions, and individual privileges to the job-task pairings for both user/group and station. 
 * The Datacap Taskmaster Client Service is connecting to the incorrect Taskmaster Server. 
 * There are multiple instances of process TMrt.exe on the client service machine. If more than one instance exists, stop the client service by terminating each instance of TMrt.exe, TMSub.exe, BPilot.exe and DCOProcessor.exe, and then start the service. Then monitor for recurrence and try to isolate the problem to specific batches or tasks; contact IBM Support for further assistance as necessary.
