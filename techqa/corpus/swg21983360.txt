PROBLEM
Sametime 9.0 to 901 upgrade fails due to lower Websphere Fix Pack level of Sametime System Console Deployment Manager than the server or node being upgraded

SYMPTOM
Installation Manager may show something similar to this: 

1301 ERROR CRIMA1217E 25:24.57 A problem occurred during the execution of the d:\IBM\WebSphere\STAdvServerPN\build_advanced.xml file. ERROR: exec returned: -1 [d:\IBM\WebSphere\STAdvServerPN\build_advanced.xml:4687] A package has an issue that cannot be resolved by Installation Manager. Identify the package that has the issue by looking at the installation history. In Installation Manager, click File > Installation History. In console mode, enter S: View Installation History. Contact IBM customer support. 1302 ERROR [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983360&amp;aid=1] 25:24.57 Invoking antfile "d:/IBM/WebSphere/STAdvServerPN/build_advanced.xml". 
The Log file in the ant folder shows the following:

[exec] ADMU0127E: The version of the Deployment Manager (8.5.5.8) is earlier than that
[exec] of this node (8.5.5.9). 

CAUSE
The reason for the upgrade failure is that the SSC (Deployment Manager) is at a lower Fix Pack level then the node you are upgrading. 

This caused the node synchronization (syncNode) process to fail. 
The deployment manager must always be the same or newer than any federated node.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Insure that the Deployment Manager (Sametime System Console) is at the same or higher Websphere Fix Pack level than the component being updated 


You can either upgrade the SystemConsole/Deployment manager to 8.5.5.9 or downgrade the Sametime Server (Advanced, Meetings, Media or Proxy) Node to 8.5.5.8. (as shown in this example)

Then re-run the Installation Manger and apply the update. 

If re-running the update should fail because the Installation Manger thinks it is already updated, collect a new set of Installation Manger logs and open a pmr with IBM Technical Support.
