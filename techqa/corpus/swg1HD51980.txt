COMMENTS
 *  Incident Diagnosis
   In this scenario , the customer complains that
   1 - the width and height in print dialog box is not
   the format chosen width and height.
   2 - The drawing is not correctly centered
   Correct Application
   1- print dialog box width and height are not
   supposed to be the chosen format width and
   height. They define the object to print width and
   height, that is, in this case, the viewer area width
   and height in mm.
   2 - To center the object to print in the chosen
   paper, the user should choose the "Fit in Page"
   option instead of the "No Fitting" option. With
   the "No fitting Option", the object to print is not
   scaled and may lie partly outside the paper.
