   CVEID: CVE-2016-0475
   DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE
   Java SE Embedded and Jrockit related to the Libraries
   component has partial confidentiality impact, partial
   integrity impact, and no availability impact.
   CVSS Base Score: 5.8
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946]
   for the current score
   CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
   CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
   CVEID: CVE-2015-7575
   DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected
   security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash
   function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS
   handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using
   man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and
   obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to
   as  óÔé¼ ôSLOTH óÔé¼  ¢.
   CVSS Base Score: 7.1
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415]

   CVEID: CVE-2016-0448
   DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE
   and Java SE Embedded related to the JMX component could allow
   a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in
   a partial confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
   CVSS Base Score: 4
