The size of the marshall.jar which is located in the WebSphere® Application Server under /AppServer/plugins/com.ibm.ws.wsadie/marshall.jar is smaller than the previous version shipped:
only 71KB.

CAUSE
The marshall.jar that is shipped in WebSphere® Application Server is missing some resource bundles files. 


The following properties files are missing from the marshall.jar:


 *  MarshallResourceBundle.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_de.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_es.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_fr.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_it.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_ja.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_ko.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_pt_BR.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_zh_CN.properties 
 *  MarshallResourceBundle_zh_TW.properties


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 Locate the marshall.jar which is in com\ibm\etools\marshall\util\ . 

 Extract the content of marshall.jar into a temporary directory. 

 You will not find any MarshallResourceBundle properties files.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please contact IBM Rational Client Support to send you the marshall.jar from the IBM Test Fix Portal. 

 This will be fixed in future versions of WebSphere Application Server updates. 

 The WebSphere Application Server APAR is PM69438.
