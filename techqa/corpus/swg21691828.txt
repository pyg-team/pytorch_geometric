Text:
bootstrapping TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to save the bootstrap configuration for IBM FileNet WorkplaceXT fails to save to the Preferences folder 

SYMPTOM
Error to the browser after clicking save:
com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;The requested item was
not found. Object identity: /Preferences/Site Preferences for
WorkplaceXT. Class name: Versionable. [Code=null] ... Object Reference
[DOCUMENT:1] ID "/Preferences/Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT" in
ObjectStore "Preferences";
OMFC/Document/GetProperties//E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND

Error in an FFDC log file on the WorkplaceXT web application server:
Exception:javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException
SourceId:com.ibm.ws.naming.util.WsnInitCtxFactory.getRootJndiContext
ProbeId:912 Reporter:java.lang.Class@78ca78ca
javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException: A communication failure
occurred while attempting to obtain an initial context with the
provider URL: "iiop://TestHost:2809". Make sure that any bootstrap
address information in the URL is correct and that the target name
server is running. A bootstrap address with no port specification
defaults to port 2809. Possible causes other than an incorrect
bootstrap address or unavailable name server include the network
environment and workstation network configuration. [Root exception is

CAUSE
WcmApiConfig.properties file contained a typo in the host name for the UploadURL.

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Checked the WebSphere SystemOut.log which showed FFDC files were created at the time the Site Preferences were failing to save to the Preferences folder. Six FFDC files were created, but the error was only included in one file.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Correct the WcmApiConfig.properties file and redeploy:





 1. Locate and backup the install copy of the WcmConfig.properties file. Default location: <WorkplaceXT_Install_Dir>\FileNet\WebClient\WorkplaceXT\WEB-INF\WcmApiConfig.properties 
 2. Edit the WcmApiConfig.properites to locate and correct errors in the UploadURL. Save the changes 
 3. Stop Websphere for WorkplaceXT, undeploy (uninstall) 
 4. Clear out Websphere temp, wstemp, and wscache for the WorkplaceXT JVM 
 5. Recreate the WAR and EAR files for WorkplaceXT. See the product documentation for more details:
    http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.1.0/com.ibm.p8.installingxt.doc/wxtip034.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.1.0/com.ibm.p8.installingxt.doc/wxtip034.htm?lang=en] 
 6. Start the WebSphere JVM and redeploy WorkplaceXT. See the product documentation for more details: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.1.0/com.ibm.p8.installingxt.doc/wxtip036.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.1.0/com.ibm.p8.installingxt.doc/wxtip036.htm?lang=en] 
 7. Restart WebSphere 
 8. Log on to WorkplaceXT as a GCD or Application Engine administrator to confirm WorkplaceXT is now bootstrapped. If it has, you'll land on the browse object stores page, if not customized.
