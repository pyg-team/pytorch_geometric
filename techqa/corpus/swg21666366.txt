THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After "Uninstall and reconfigure of SDMS and TCORE", SOA applications are not getting deployed to eWAS.

The deployment should have driven by TEPS during TEPS reconfiguration but it did not. 

SYMPTOM
Even if kd4ewas.properties file is ready and correctly created. And also, TEPS reconfigured and created itmEwasREgistry.properties file... 

 Yet, SOA apps are not getting deployed to eWAS (itmEwasRegistry.properties file created without proper KD4 entry in it). 

* For example : If SOA apps deployed to eWAS SUCCESSFULLY =>
The itmEwasRegistry.properties file should look something like this:

#Do not edit this file

*** END OF FILE *** 

* If SOA apps are FAILED to get deployed to eWAS => 
The itmEwasRegistry.properties file is missing with the entry with KD4 (in bold above).



CAUSE
Absolute cause is not known but suspect is that path was messed up.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use this technote to check if SOA Application is not deployed to eWAS or not. http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666534 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666534]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Following procedure rebuilds the itmEwasRegistry.properties file. 
It basically re-drives the eWas install scripts. 


1) Stop *ALL* ITM processes. 
2) Delete or rename file : <ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\itmEwasRegistry.properties 
3) Delete or rename directory: <ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile 
4) Delete or rename directory: <ITM_HOME>\logs 
5) Modify <ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\properties\profileRegistry.xml as follows: 
It will look something like this before modification: 


Before modification: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<profiles> 
<profile isAReservationTicket="false" isDefault="true" 
name="ITMProfile" path="C:IBMITMCNPSJprofilesITMProfile" 
template="C:IBMITMCNPSJprofileTemplatesdefault"/> 
</profiles> 


After modification: 
Delete all lines between <profiles> and </profiles> so that it 
now looks like this: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<profiles> 
</profiles> 

If profileRegistry.xml looks like this, it does not need to be 
changed.. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<profiles/> 

6) Perform a reinstall of TEPS (ex:6.2.3 FP3) - changing nothing. This step is 
just a rerun of setup from the CD image. Run the setup and as stated 
change nothing. 

7) After the run completes the itmEwasRegistry.properties 
file will contain the KD4 entries. 

 
NOTE: If LDAP is being used it will have to be reconfigured after this 
procedure is executed.
