APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After an upgrade from MQ V7.1 to V9.0, using
   MQ V9.0 we notice that in some cases the x13E
   abends are not suppressed anymore.
   In the MSTR job log the customer notice the
   following CSQY291E error message:
   .
   00000090  CSQY291E CSQWDSDM SDUMPX FAILED,
   RC=00000408,SSID,ABN=13E-00000000,
   LOC=CSQ3SSGP.CSQ3SSI1+00000836
   .
   The S13E abend is occuring due to an S0C4 during
   recovery processing for the abend.
   The S0C4 is in CSQWDSD0 as it issues a SETFRR
   whilst in key 7 (needs to be issued in key 0).
   .
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   ABEND0C4 ABENDS0C4 S0C4 S00C4
   The failing instruction is 5870 900C.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 9       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When an MQ application terminates       *
   *                      generating S13E abends, the dumps are   *
   *                      not suppressed which is the default     *
   *                      behaviour in most z/OS systems.         *
   ****************************************************************
   When an MQ application terminates generating abends like S13E
   there is a 0C4 abend in the error recovering routines that
   results in an unexpected dump.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQWDSD0 has been changed to prevent causing the 0C4 abend.
