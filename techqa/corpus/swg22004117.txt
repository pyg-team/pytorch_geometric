 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are there no scrypt4 firmware images on Fix Central to upgrade a virtual XG or XI to version 7.6.? 

ANSWER
To upgrade a virtual XG45 or XI52 to version 7.6, you must first run a migration tool from Fix Central to convert the virtual XG45 or XI52 to a virtual DataPower Gateway. You can convert these virtual products to a virtual DataPower Gateway at any time. 

You can obtain the migration tools from IBM Fix Central. Search with the text string Migration. 

 * Use xg-virtual_migration to convert a virtual XG45 to a virtual DataPower Gateway. 
 * Use xi-virtual_migration to convert a virtual XI52 to a virtual DataPower Gateway.


You can obtain the appropriate modules to activate from IBM Passport Advantage. I you previously purchased a module for your virtual XG45 or XI52, you entitled to the activator tool for the DataPower Gateway. Beyond this entitlement, you also have the following entitlements based on product.  * If you purchased the Data Integration Module for XG45, you are entitled to the Integration Module. 
 * If you purchased XI52, you are entitled to the Integration Module.


Attention: Before you start the process, create a full system backup not a secure-backup package. If the system reboots between the processing of the migration tool and the processing of your final activation tool, you might lose part of your persisted configuration. If a reboot happens, you can use this backup to restore your last persisted configuration. 

The end-end-to-end migration process is as follows.  1. Download the migration tool from IBM Fix Central. 
 2. Run the migration tool. 
 3. Download appropriate modules from IBM Passport Advantage for feature parity. 
 4. Run the activators from the CLI with the following command.
    # boot image -f accept-license activator 
 5. Download a 7.1.0.17, 7.2.0.16, 7.5.0.8, 7.5.1.7, 7.5.2.7, 7.6.0.0 or later firmware image from IBM Fix Central. 
 6. Upgrade the firmware to from the CLI with the following command.
    # boot image -f accept-license firmware


After the conversion, the reported product changes as follows.  * XG45 (5275-J90) is a DataPower Gateway (5275-T09) 
 * XI52 (5275-J91) is a DataPower Gateway (5275-T09)
