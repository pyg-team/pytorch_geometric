QUESTION
 Is it possible to configure the ISAM Appliance Integrated with Sharepoint using SAML for Claims-based Authentication in a Multiple replicated Webseal environment 

ANSWER
There is no way of sharing the cookies between IE and MS Client in a highly-available WebSEAL environment.
The best option is to configure the load balancer to use sticky / persistent sessions and, to fail over
to a backup WebSEAL instance in the case where the primary is unresponsive. This could be achieved
by using Source Hashing algorithm (an algorithm supported by ISAM's FELB implementation -

This ensures user requests are sent to the correct WebSEAL instance after authentication while still allowing a degree of automated fail-over. 

The only real limitation here is that if the primary goes down, while continuation of service will be observed, user sessions will be lost across IE/MSClient and users will need to re-authenticate with the secondary WebSEAL instance .
