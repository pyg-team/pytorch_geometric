APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are installing Statistics 23.0 on Mac OS X and using a
   Spanish primary locale or simply the Spanish Installer GUI.
   When your installation is complete and you have licensed the
   product with the License Authorization Wizard, you launch the
   product only to see a splash screen indicating Statistics 21.0
   and a build number indicating Statistics 23.0.  Immediately
   after launch the Output Viewer Windows comes up showing you
   errors about the Statistics Manager GUI  and the Statistics
   engine not matching.
   
   Note: This behavior has also been observed when installing under
   Italian.
   
   Workaround:
   Install under another language  (English, French, German,
   Portuguese) and be sure to select the Online Help for
   Spanish to be installed.
   Once you have launched the product successfully, Use the Edit ->
   Options menus to change the User Interface and Output to
   Spanish.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed for customers who need the fix
   prior to the next upcoming Fix Pack.
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI40477
   and Technote 1959436 about about Interim Fix 014 for IBM SPSS
   Statistics 23.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
