QUESTION
 Using ITCAM for Tx with WRT agent 7.4 installed on Windows 32bit OS, kfcmserver.exe does not start 

CAUSE
Windows Network Monitor has been installed but not WinPcap

ANSWER
With WRT 7.4 on Windows , you need to install WinPcap, not "Windows Network Monitor". 


If WinPcap is not installed yet, when starting the WRT "ITCAM for Web Response Time" service, kt5agent process is started, but not kfcmserver.exe


<ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\logs\<host>_t5_<timestamp>.log is ending with many messages like :
analyzerlogadapter.cpp,59,"log") (E:\tema\itm\t5tema\CWRMCollector.cpp,226) Connecting...
analyzerlogadapter.cpp,59,"log") (E:\tema\itm\t5tema\CWRMCollector.cpp,242) Unable to connect. rc[12]



Attempting to start manually, from a Windows command line, the kfcmserver with command like :
<ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\wrm\Analyzer\kfcmserver.exe test
fails with error like :
Unable to locate component - the application has failed to start because wpcap.dll was not found 

 

So 

 

- uninstall Windows Network Monitor 

- install WinPcap 

 

you can refer to ITCAM4Tx 7.4 documentation link :
