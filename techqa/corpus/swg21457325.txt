QUESTION
 Provide some details and links to documentation regarding Transaction Tracking enablement for Web Servers with ARM. 

CAUSE
Using for example ITCAM for Tx Transaction Tracking in the following environment : 

Distributed (non z_OS) SLES 10 Update 2 server machine, with Apache web server v2.2.x, and "F5" device seating between the Apache server and WebSphere Portal Server.

Is it possible to 'arm' Apache web server for transaction tracking, without using the Websphere plugin ?


ANSWER
A) There is not a specific TTAPI/ARM Data Collector plug-in for Apache HTTP Server. So the answer to the above question is No. 


You would need to use the WebSphere Plug-in to arm instrument the Apache Web Server, like you would do with IHS (IBM Http Server). 
see : [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/tt/dita/task/kto_tools_arm_enable_ihs.html?lang=en]
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/task/kto_tools_arm_enable_ihs.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/task/kto_tools_arm_enable_ihs.html]

B) If the applications running on Apache are not armed already, one option would need to arm them manually, or TTAPI them manually; refer for that to TT API User Guide available at :
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/ttapiug/oview_ttapi.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/ttapiug/oview_ttapi.html]


C) In case the applications running on Apache web server are already armed :
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/reference/kto_tools_arm_setup4arm.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/reference/kto_tools_arm_setup4arm.html]
this link says :
"Running ARM-instrumented applications on UNIX systems" :
Transaction Tracking provides a shell script that allows you to modify the environment on UNIX® operating systems so that applications that are ARM-instrumented can make ARM calls and find the appropriate runtime libraries. The shell script is named setup4ARM.sh; it is placed in the $CANDLE_HOME/arch/tu/tusupport directory during installation. To use this script, you must provide a single parameter to the script that is in the path to the script. 
For example, ../setup4ARM.sh ./setup4ARM.sh


D) In case the WebSphere AS plug-in can be used in the environment :
"For Transaction Tracking, All three types of Web servers (Apache, IHS, IIS) are instrumented by the ARM dll. Refer to "Enabling ARM transactions" in the ITCAM for Tx documentation:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/concept/kto_tools_arm_ihs.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0.1/com.ibm.itcamt.doc/tt/dita/concept/kto_tools_arm_ihs.html]

E) The main thing to watch out for when instrumenting Web servers are :
- Make sure the right ARM dll (ie 32 vs 64bit) get copied. 
- Make sure the paths for the web server is setup such that the correct dlls are selected 
- Make sure there is access permissions for the ARM dlls (eg on Unix platforms, the user that the web server is running as needs execute permissions on the dll).
- Ensure that CANDLE_HOME is define appropriately for the web server process. 
- Be aware that the ARM filtering configuration (via AMCE) is located at $ITM_HOME\camconfig\... (which is derived from CANDLE_HOME, hence the point above).This is delivered from the AMCE (T3 agent) to the "local host" via the Transaction Collector (TU) agent. 
- When the TU is not located on the same machine as the web server, you need to manually copy the configuration file across.

F) "Data collector plugin" is a generic term referring to anything sending tracking data to a Transaction Collector. The following data collector plugins are available : 
*native TTAPI - comes with the Transaction Collector and is installed in the "tusupport/ttapi" directory on distributed platforms, and on the tape for zOS and installed in the usual way for zOS. 

*ARM DLL - comes with the Transaction Collector and is installed in the "tusupport" directory. 

* WebSphere MQ data collector - installed as a separate component and is installed to "kth" directory for distributed environment, and on the tape for zOS and installed in the usual way for zOS. 

* ITCAM for WAS 6.1 FP3 with IF15. IF15 can be found on the web support site for ITCAM for WAS 6.1 

* ITCAM for AD 7.1

* CICS - comes with the z/OS tape and installed in standard way for z/OS applications.

* CICS TG 

* IMS™ 

* Tuxedo 

* WebSphere Message Broker 

* SOA, via ITCAM for SOA

* J2EE, via ITCAM for J2EE 

The data collector plugin will collect transactions for a specific domain. it's composed of a combination of a Transaction Tracking API (Transaction Tracking Application Programming Interface) and its supporting files which, when installed on a domain, enables an application to transmit tracking data to a Transaction Collector.
