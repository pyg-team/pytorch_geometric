APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Client opened PMR 27695,49R,000 in January for ICN 2.0.1. A test
   fix was
   provided in February and it resolved the issue. However, as soon
   as they
   upgraded to 2.0.2, the same problem occurs again.
   
   Specifically, a non-admin user cannot add a document to the
   repository
   (due to "insufficient access") when a security proxy is used
   (see PMR
   27695,49R,000).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem is the customer does not even give the user the
   ability to read the proxy object  which means we can't try to
   read the object to get the id in the add item code.  What was
   happening was when we tried to read it and could not we would
   end up setting null for the the security proxy value .  The fix
   is if the value is null to not try to set anything. and let CE
   handle it.
