PROBLEM
To better diagnose syndication problems with IBM Web Content Manager (WCM) V6.1, use this document to gather initial information. Gathering this information before calling IBM Support will assist you in understanding the problem and save time analyzing the data.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Here are some questions that should be answered along with completing gathering the information below. Please be sure to include these answers along with your submission:
1. Is this the first time you are you syndicating to this subscriber? If not, what changes have been made since the last successful syndication between these two servers?

2. Are you syndicating between one syndicator and one subscriber or are there multiple relationships set up? If multiples, provide details.

3. Is your syndicator or subscriber part of a cluster? If so, please describe the details of the syndication relationship (syndicating to primary node, all nodes, and so on).

4. Are you syndicating multiple libraries in the same definition? Do you have a separate design/component library from content? If so, are you syndicating the libraries together?

5. Are you syndicating All items or Live Items?

6. Is this automatic or manual syndication?

7. Are the syndicator and subscriber pointing to the same ldap? If different ldaps then are the users and groups identical?

8. Are the syndicator(s) and subscriber(s) at the same fix level If not, please bring them to the same fix level prior to submitting information.

9. Have you done any authoring on the subscriber?

10. If doing an all items syndication, is versioning enabled on the syndicator?
