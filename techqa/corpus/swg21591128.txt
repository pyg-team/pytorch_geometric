Title: IBM What characters cannot be used for a FileNet Content Engine bootstrap user password? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Issues encountered when changing the bootstrap user password to include special characters. 

Attempts to [activity performed] result in [what happened - 'error'] when using FileNet Platform.
We had to change password for Bootstarp admin user and we are running into issues with the password that has special characters but it is working fine with a password that has no special characters. 
As per our company policy password should have at least one special character. Current password with which we are running into issues has special characters (' = ; $ !). 

SYMPTOM
The password verification for the 'uszdmadm1' principal name failed. Root cause: 'javax.naming.AuthenticationException: [LDAP: error code 49 - 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, vece]; Resolved object: 'com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@25282528''.. 

[3/28/12 14:24:35:344 CDT] 0000003b SystemOut O [WSIAuthenticatorImpl] login exception: CWWIM4529E The password verification for the 'uszdmadm1' principal name failed. Root cause: 'javax.naming.AuthenticationException: [LDAP: error code 49 - 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, vece]; Resolved object: 'com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@25282528''.


CAUSE
Could not authenticate the user trying to login. This is a result of an incorrect username or password, or an incorrect prefix and/or suffix specified in the Settings tab, depending on the type of LDAP/AD system. Could also mean the authentication type is incorrect. Also an incorrect username attribute or incorrect name attribute can cause this. Common cause of this error is a user trying to login with DOMAIN\login instead of just login. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a limitation in the name and/or password used for the WebSphere accounts. 

If the user ID contains a special character (namely, "#", "," , "+", """, "\", "", "<", ">" or ";"), the unique name that is generated has an escape sequence consisting of a backslash (\) preceding the special character. 

The above characters, which also include the ";", should be avoided from the password. 

This is not a defect but a documented limitation in WebSphere.
