YouTube Video SiteProtector 3.x: Agent Manager Reinstall (7:51) This video give instructions on how to reinstall Agent Manager on SiteProtector 3.x. Watch the video on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eG77zwIW9c&list=PLFip581NcL2VBFVjuObovOQWI-azUXEXc&index=34] (7:51) 


Important: If your SiteProtector Core version is 3.0 or older, do not proceed to the below steps before following the instructions in Technote 1685758: Considerations before reinstalling the Agent Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21685758]. If your SiteProtector Core is at 3.1 or newer, you can disregard the prerequisite instructions. 

If the .pem files at Step 2 are missing or are corrupted and you are not planning to back them up and restore them, new *.pem files will be generated during the reinstall and you will need to re-register all of the agents once the reinstall process is completed. 

 1. Download the Agent Manager installation package from the IBM Download Center [https://ibmss.flexnetoperations.com/control/ibms/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Fibms%2Fpurchases] under My Software Download > IBM Security SiteProtector System > choose your software version > Installation Packages > AgentManager-Setup.exe.
    
    
 2. Back up the following files from the server on which your Agent Manager is installed:
    
    \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Agent Manager\server.pem
    \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Agent Manager\certificates\*.pem
    \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Agent Manager\rsspdc.ini
    
    Note: the server.pem has been changed to server.kdb as of SiteProtector 3.x.
    
 3. To uninstall the Agent Manager go to the Control Panel on the server on which the Agent Manager is installed and go to Programs and Features.
    
     1. Select the entry for the SiteProtector Agent Manager and right click and select the Uninstall menu. 
     2. Click No on the "Do you want to uninstall some, or all, of the other SiteProtector components?" question. This will not remove any other SiteProtector components besides the Agent Manager. 
     3. Click OK to Confirm Agent Manager deletion. 
     4. Archive the server encryption keys when asked, preferably on another system than the SiteProtector server (you will see a prompt if the chosen folder is on the installation drive), and click Next.
        
        
    
    
 4. Once the old Agent Manager is removed, run the Agent Manager installation package downloaded in Step 1 to install a new instance. Follow the install prompts to install a new Agent Manager component:
    
     1.  Launch the Agent Manager install package. 
     2.  Choose your language and select Next. 
     3.  Click Next on the Welcome Screen to continue the install. 
     4.  Choose Accept and click Next on the Software License Agreement screen. 
     5.  Click Next to keep the default installation directory or choose Browse to change it on the Change Destination Location screen. 
     6.  Click Next on the Cryptography Security Standard. By default, Compatible Cryptography is selected unless the SiteProtector is installed in FIPS mode. 
     7.  Choose the Primary IP address and select Next in case there are multiple NICs. 
     8.  Choose between SQL or Windows Authentication for the Agent Manager account to be used with SiteProtector Database and click Next to continue. For SQL authentication, the system creates a SQL Server login for the Agent Manager. If you use Windows authentication, you must specify an existing Windows account with access rights to connect to the database. 
     9.  Read the Auto import screen and select Next to continue the install. 
     10. Read the Authentication screen and select Next to continue the install. 
     11. Read the Private Key Archival screen and select Next to continue the install. If you did not archive the keys during the uninstall stage of the Agent Manager it can be done now. 
     12. Click Finish to end the install process.
         
         
    
    
 5. To restore the configuration files backed up in Step 2, open Windows Services on the Agent Manager server and stop the issDaemon service.
    
    
 6. Replace the files backed up in Step 2 (server.pem, rsspdc.ini in the Agent Manager directory and the .pem file from the certificates directory).
    
    
 7. Start the issDaemon service and check the status of the newly installed Agent Manager in the SiteProtector Console.
    
    

Note: In case the new Agent Manager is in an Unknown status, copy the Event Collector keys to the new Agent Manager and restart the SiteProtector Sensor Controller service: 

From: \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector\Keys 
To: \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Agent Manager\Keys
