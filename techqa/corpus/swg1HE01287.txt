APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a user searches for e-mail in IBM InfoSphere Content
   Collector and one of the e-mail documents in the search
   result contains a comment character (like "/*") in one
   of the fields that is displayed in the search result
   list, Content Collector returns the following error:
   
   The system cannot connect to the server. The server
   might be down or there might be a network problem. HTTP
   error code: 0, error text: JSON was not comment filtered
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If an e-mail document contains special characters, like "/*",
   in the title or any other property that is displayed in the
   search result list, the document can be archived and indexed
   successfully. However, when a search result list contains that
   document, Content Collector returns an error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, comment characters in a display field
   do not cause an error message anymore.
