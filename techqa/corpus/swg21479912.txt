Title: IBM Amos won't use case weights from SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have weighted data in IBM SPSS Statistics that I would like to use in Amos. When I launch Amos from SPSS Statistics and try to estimate my model, Amos tells me that it will ignore my case weights and assign each case a weight of 1. How do I get Amos to recognize and use my case weights? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
NOTE: The following solution will apply FREQUENCY weighting only. If you are trying to apply SAMPLE weighting to accommodate some complex sampling situation then you will need to seek some other approach. Neither Amos nor SPSS Statistics will accommodate a complex sampling scenario directly (the SPSS Complex Samples module is designed to handle complex sample designs, but it does not provide anything that can be directly read into Amos).

The current version of Amos really won't apply case weights from SPSS Statistics. It will, however, read an SPSS Statistics system file (*.sav). The trick then is to create a correlation (or covariance) matrix as a data file in SPSS Statistics and then associate that system file with your Amos path diagram. 

If you are starting from a known correlation/covariance matrix, see Dr. Arbuckle's examples on his web site:

http://amosdevelopment.com/support/faq/enter_sample_covariances.htm [http://amosdevelopment.com/support/faq/enter_sample_covariances.htm] 

If you are beginning from raw data in SPSS Statistics, apply Technote # 1476687.

NOTE AGAIN: Amos will not directly accommodate a complex sampling scenario.
