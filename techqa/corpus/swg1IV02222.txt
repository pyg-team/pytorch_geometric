ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   
   We are currently working on a project with IBM services where we
   are
   configuring Data Fetchers (ITM Policy is the type).  We are
   trying to
   verify the data on the dashboards is valid  and come up with
   good
   thresholds for ITM Situations thresholds to set.  We are having
   a
   problem being able to map out the Agent Query name in the Data
   Fetcher
   configuration screen to a TEPS/TEMS query name.  I want to be
   able to
   build the necessary workspaces in TEPS and leverage that data
   for
   verification of the TBSM screens and model situations from but I
   can't
   map the TBSM info back to ITM info.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Names and descriptions for queries on the Tivoli Business
   Systems Manager (TBSM) data fetcher do not match what is
   displayed on the portal client.
   
   On the Tivoli Business Systems Manager (TBSM) data fetcher a
   list of queries can be displayed.  However, the names and
   descriptions for those queries do not match what is displayed on
   the portal client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ITM Web Service did not use the real name and description
   properties, because these are resource ids that needed to
   translated.  Support for the resource bundles was never
   implemented.
   
   The ITM Web Service now has resource bundle support implemented.
   To fully utilize this change the APAR IV03424 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV03424] must be applied to
   the Tivoli Business Systems Manager (TBSM) Data Fetcher.
   
   This fix is implemented with English only support, no NLS
   support.
