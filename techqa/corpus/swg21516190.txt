Title: IBM Error 84 when commuting a licence - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to commute a licence you receive error 84, however when you try using a network licence whilst connected to the local network IBM SPSS Statistics obtains a licence and works correctly. 

CAUSE
The problem may be due to either a permissions issue where Sentinel, the licence manager for IBM SPSS Statistics can not access a folder or the persistent storage for the licences has corrupt information.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open the commute utility and check out a licence.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Error 84 is usually a permissions problem.


This is normally caused by the user access to "\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel RMS Development Kit\System"

The commuter utility creates the following files under this directory when users check in/out licenses.

Make sure the folder is not full or files are not write protected, so that commuter utility could overwrite these files: 
clauth1.dll 
clauth2.dll 
ssprs.dll 
ssprs.tgz 
grcauth1.dll 
grcauth2.dll 
prsgrc.dll 
prsgrc.tgz 

If the problem is still occurring then it is likely there is corruption in the persistent storage, to resolve this you need to delete the contents of:
"\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel RMS Development Kit\System\
