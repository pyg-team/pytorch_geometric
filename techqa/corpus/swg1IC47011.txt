APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Documentation is unclear regarding TSM migration/upgrade use of
   rpm parameters.
   .
   The Linux 5.3 installation guide also  references rpm -ivh on a
   migrate install.  To use rpm -ivh one needs to use rpm -e to
   remove the existing packages before the new can be installed
   (not mentioned).  In Linux rpm -U should remove existing
   packages before installing but documentation does not mention
   this parameter.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager      *
   *                 for Linux Installation Guide Version 5.3.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: See Error Description in APAR.          *

   Steps 2 - 7 were updated in the "Installation and
   Configuration" section of the Linux  Installation Guide,
   making the installation/configuration instructions more
   clear and including more information on the rpm commands.
   
   2. If you are installing from a CD media, insert the
   Tivoli Storage Manager CD into a CD-ROM  drive and change
   to that drive. For example: cd /mnt/cdrom If you are
   installing from a .bz2  file obtained from the IBM
   software maintenance web site, go to the directory where
   the .bz2  file resides and issue the following command:
   tar xjf TIVsm-server-5.3.2.0.i686.tar.bz2
   
   3. See the README file on the CD for changes to the
   installation procedure.
   
   4. To install the server on Linux , you must accept the
   license agreement. Perform the following steps.
   a. Run the install_server script. The syntax is: ./install_
   server [prefix] where prefix is  optional, and it denotes
   the file system where you would like IBM Tivoli Storage
   Manager to  be installed. If no prefix is given, the
   default is /opt.
   b. From the displayed menu, select a number for the
   language that you prefer to display the license agreement.
   Press Enter.
   c. The install_server script will display the license
   agreement in the language specified,  and ask for you to
   accept them. To accept the license agreement, press 1,
   followed by the Enter key.
   
   5. Once you have accepted the license agreement, a
   menu will be displayed with all the  available RPM
   packages for the corresponding platform. At this point,
   you can either quit the install_server script by
   pressing 'q,' followed by the Enter key, or select packages
   from the menu to be installed. If you exit the menu, you
   can install any of the RPM packages  that correspond
   to your platform manually, using the Red Hat Package
   Manager (rpm). The default installation location that
   rpm uses to install the IBM Tivoli Storage
   Manager packages is /opt. To install to a different
   location, use the --prefix option in rpm.
   
   6. If you chose to use the menu, choosing the Basic(b)
   installation will install the server.  If you have an
   older version of Tivoli Storage Manager installed, the
   install server script  will detect that and issue the
   rpm -U command to upgrade the existing Tivoli Storage
   Manager  packages. If no Tivoli Storage Manager packages
   are installed on the system, the  install_server script
   will issue the rpm -i command to perform a fresh install
   of the Tivoli Storage Manager packages. If you are
   installing from a CD-ROM media, the Basic(b) selection
   will also install or upgrade the license enabler.
   
   7. If you decide to install the packages manually,
   outside of the install_server script,  here is how you can
   install the packages. If an older version of the Tivoli
   Storage Manager  package is installed, issue the following
   command: rpm -Uvh <packagename> where  <packagename> is one
   of the packages that you want to install. With the
   above command, rpm will upgrade the existing
   Tivoli Storage Manager package in the same file system
   where it is currently installed.
   
   To install to a different file system, you would have to
   remove the existing package and  perform a fresh install
   of the new package, using the --prefix option. For
   example: rpm -e  <packagename> rpm -ivh <packagename>
   --prefix /usr
   
   Note: To find out which Tivoli packages are installed
   on the system, enter the following command:
   rpm -qa | grep TIVsm If the Tivoli Storage
   Manager package is not installed,  perform a fresh
   installation by issuing the following command:
   rpm -ivh <packagename> [-- prefix] where --prefix is
   optional and denotes the file system where you want the
   Tivoli  Storage Manager package to be installed.
   
   
   This information is projected to be documented in the
   next release.
   Note that this is subject to change at the discretion of IBM.
