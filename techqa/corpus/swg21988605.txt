 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of WebSphere Commerce Developer Version 8 fails and you can see in the WCDE_installdir/logs/setup.log file that the installation fails during UpdateSearchPathsInDatabase. 

SYMPTOM
BUILD FAILED 

w:\IBM\WCDE8O\components\foundation\subcomponents\search\deploy\enablesearchTK. xml :78: The following error occurred while executing this line:
w:\IBM\WCDE8O\components\foundation\subcomponents\search\deploy\enablesearchTK. xml :281: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: The class com.ibm.commerce.cloudscape.Internal.helpers. Replace


CAUSE
WebSphere Commerce Developer failed to install because a default WAS profile exists and the default WAS profile uses SDK Java Technology Edition 6.0 (1.6 JDK). WebSphere Commerce Developer Version 8 requires a 64 bit version of SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 (1.7 JDK) SR4, or any later Version 7.0 Service Refresh. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Get the default profile name of WebSphere Application Server by running the following command:
>cd <WAS_INSTALL_ROOT>\bin
>manageprofiles.bat -getDefaultName 

 1. Install SDK Java Version 7.0 if it is not installed. For more information, see Installing and uninstalling SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 or 7.1 on distributed operating systems [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.doc/ae/tins_installation_jdk7.html].
    Note: Ensure that you install Version 7.0 and not 7.1. 
 2. Update the default WebSphere Application Server profile to use the 64 bit version of SDK Java Version 7.0 by running the following command:
    >cd <WAS_INSTALL_ROOT>\bin 
    >managesdk.bat -enableProfile -profileName <Default Profile Name> -sdkName 1.7_64 -enableServers
