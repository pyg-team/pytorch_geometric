Title: IBM Performance tuning considerations when IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) is running in a virtual machine - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running IBM Business Process Manager in a virtual machine is supported. However, there are some additional considerations when running servers in a virtual machine (VM) environment. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you are running a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application in a virtual machine (VM) there are additional considerations. These considerations are performance-related changes.

These document links are good resources for tuning VMware servers. 

Other things to consider: 

 * Dedicated CPU for VMs
   If you have several VMs on a node, you can experience CPU starvation.
   
   
 * Dedicated memory
   You can set up VMs to have shared RAM. Performance can be affected if the server node is swapping memory usage. 
   
   
 * Looking at the operating system resource pages (free CPU, free memory) can show that there is available resources. However, these resources are being shared or constrained at a deeper level in the larger VM server setup.
