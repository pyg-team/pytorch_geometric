APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For some Lotus Notes documents, the index requests do not
   complete and remain on the indexing queue. The error message
   "WARN Index request
   batch was deferred for rebalancing." is written to the
   P8_server_error.log file. The IBM Content Collector P8 Content
   Search Services Support
   trace file contains error messages similar to the following
   message:
   
       Exception=null [CSNHandler: parse(InputStream)]
       java.nio.BufferUnderflowException
       at java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.get(HeapByteBuffer.java:138)
       at java.nio.ByteBuffer.get(ByteBuffer.java:686)
       ....
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When P8 Content Search Services Support allocates the buffer for
    the attachment name, the buffer size is determined by the value
    of the attachment file name length attribute. However, if a CSN
    document is malformed, the value of the attachment file name
   length attribute and the actual length of the attachment file
   name might not match, which caused the null pointer exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search
   Services Support checks for CSN files whether the attachment
   file name length attribute value equals the actual length of the
    attachment file name. If not, IBM Content Collector P8 Content
   Search Services Support allocates the buffer by using the actual
    length of the attachment file name instead of the attachment
   file name length attribute value.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
