PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and higher. This error occurs when
   ACCE tries to open current Version of the Document instance
   using JSON file of the Document sub-class. There is no separate
   JSON for user-defined Document sub-classes. A code fix has been
   put in to use Document class JSON. Now ACCE opens the Version
   without displaying any error.
