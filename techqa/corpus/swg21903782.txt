QUESTION
 Are the 1G and 10G Network Active Bypass (NAB) models affected by a Leap Second? 

ANSWER
A Leap Second does not affect the performance of the NAB unit.

The bypass timer code has explicit handling for time jumps and the latest versions use a monotonic clock. The only concern is whether or not heartbeats could be lost in case of a forward time jump with a low heartbeat time-out threshold. In-depth lab testing shows that no heartbeats are lost and the segments remain in-line.
