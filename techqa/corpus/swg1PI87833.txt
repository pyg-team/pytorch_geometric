APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer entered a /STO AREA command for an Area which was
   part of restart PREOPEN. The command completed and Area was
   stopped. After PREOPEN completed, /STA Area was attempted, but
   failed with DFS3702I RSN10 and DFS3702I RC06.
   Preopen does bulk DBRC authorization of a list of Areas, and
   then opens each area. If the open fails ( DBFCMOC1 CALLOPEN )
   the DBRC authorization done by preopen isn't released.
   /STA AREA is then unable to obtain authorization for the Area
   after PREOPEN completes.

   Customer entered a /STO AREA command for an Area which was part
   of restart PREOPEN. The command completed and Area was stopped.
   After PREOPEN completed, /STA AREA was attempted, but failed
   with DFS3702I RSN10 and DFS3702I RC06.  Preopen does bulk DBRC
   authorization of a list of Areas, and then opens each area. If

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following change has been made to correct the reported
   problem:
   DBFCMOC1:  Add code to release DBRC authorization if AREA open
   failed during PREOPEN processing.
