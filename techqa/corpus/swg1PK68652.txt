APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When installing WebSphere Portal Express v6.1 on System i, onto
   an existing instance of WebSphere Application Server v6.1.0.17,
   it prompts the user for the installation CD containing fix pack
   15 (# I-1) instead of recognizing that fix pack 17 is already
   installed and supersedes its minimum requirement.
   
   This also affects the installation of WebSphere Portal
   Server, Enable, Extend and Lotus Web Content Management
   editions.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Installer wrongly confining installation to specific WAS level
   and not allowing higher levels.  WP 61 MP and WP 61 Express were
   tested only with WAS 6.1.0.15 along with the necessary WAS
   iFixes but were not tested with higher version of WAS than
   6.1.0.15. However, we do allow users to choose existing
   installation of WAS 6.1.0.15. Installing the required WAS iFixes
   is the user responsibility.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Users can use this updated installation archive file to specify
   the WebSphere Application Server version that users want the
   installer to detect and configure with the WebSphere Portal
   version 6.1. Installing the required Application Server interim
   fixes is the user's responsibility.

   **NOTE: this fix is available in three edition-specific
   versions.  Ensure you are using the correct fix before beginning
   the installation!
   
      1. Using the installation images on writeable media, such as
         a hard drive or network drive, replace
         {I-Setup}/dist/wpinstall.jar with the attached jar file,
         after copying the original wpinstall.jar to a safe
         location.
   
      2. Run either of the following commands to specify for
         example WAS 6.1.0.17:
           install400.bat -W setWASHome.wasversion=6.1.0.17
           install.sh -W setWASHome.wasversion=6.1.0.17
   
      3. Follow the screens to complete the installation.
