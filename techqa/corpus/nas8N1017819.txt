Title: IBM DNS Query Returning Old IP Address - United States

Text:
DNS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to clear the DNS Query cache on the iSeries. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The iSeries acts as a DNS "client" (also called "resolver"), it caches the responses it receives; much like a DNS server does to queries it makes to other DNS servers. There is a way to clear that cache, without having to IPL. 

Execute the Change TCP/IP Domain (CHGTCPDMN) command with no parameters to do this. From the operating system command line, type the following:

CHGTCPDMN

Press the Enter key.

Note: This only clears the cache of the OS/400 system's DNS "client" resolver; it does not clear the cache of any DNS "server" that may also be running on the same machine. DNS servers can only have their caches flushed by ending them and starting them back up. Also, after issuing this command, you should sign off your interactive session and then sign back on to make the changes take effect for your interactive session.
