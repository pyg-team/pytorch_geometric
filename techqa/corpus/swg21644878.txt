Title: IBM Cognos Incentive Comepnsation Management – Web Portal - Session Timeout Behavior - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After an ICM Web Portal user session expires, the last page that the user has accessed is still visible. This may be a security risk for some clients that use public or shared computers, and forget to click the Log Out link before moving away from the computer. 

SYMPTOM
The ICM Web Portal session timeout can be changed by modifying the file web.xml (Ex. C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\varicent0730\WEB-INF\web.xml). 
Default user session timeout is 30 minutes.

<!-- Session -->
<session-config>
<session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
</session-config>

After an user logs in, if he or she doesn’t generate any activity (in the browser window containing ICM Web Portal), the session will timeout after the defined threshold.

Once the timeout expires, the session will be terminated at the Tomcat level. The browser will still display the last page the user accessed, but if the user returns and clicks on any link from ICM Web Portal interface, it will be redirected to the login page.

There are clients who think this is a software bug, that can cause information leeks.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Cognos ICM Web Portal, Tomcat.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This behavior is expected, and it’s not a software bug. 

All users are expected to click the Log Out link after they complete the work. Once the login page is displayed, the browser session should be closed as well. 

The recommendation above is also used for online banking or ecommerce sites.

If a shorter session timeout is desirable as well, it can be configured in web.xml and the default value is indeed 30 minutes.
