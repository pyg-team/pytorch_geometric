ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are installing WMQ V7.1.0 and do not find a description
   for parameter &CONNSWAP=YES in the CSQ6SYSP macro.
   .
   The CONNSWAP keyword of CSQ6SYSP provides the functionality that
   was previously introduced by PK97354 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK97354] for controlling whether
   applications should be swappable for the duration of an MQ API
   request.  A value of YES means that they are swappable,
   a value of NO means that they are not swappable.
   The default behaviour is that they are swappable (which is
   the same as with previous releases, except the case where
   PK97354 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK97354] was applied and the appropriate service parameter
   has been set).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CONNSWAP is a new parameter in CSQ6SYSP *
   *                      and is not documented in the Info       *
   *                      Center.                                 *
   *                      When CONNSWAP is set to NO, all tasks   *
   *                      issuing MQ API calls are made non       *
   *                      swappable.                              *
   *                      The CONNSWAP parameter is missing in    *
   *                      the start-up messages (CSQY1*I) and the *
   *                      DISPLAY SYSTEM command output.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The CONNSWAP parameter in CSQ6SYSP allows users to set batch
   jobs to be non-swappable during certain MQ API calls.
   Currently when CONNSWAP is set to NO, all tasks issuing certain
   MQ API calls are made non swappable. This should be restricted
   to batch jobs only.
   The CONNSWAP parameter should be in the CSQY1*I messages issued
   during QMGR startup as well as be part of the output generated
   by the DISPLAY SYSTEM command.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to only make batch jobs non-swappable
   when CONNSWAP is set to NO. The CONNSWAP parameter was added to
   the CSQY105I message as well as the DISPLAY SYSTEM command
   output. The CSQ4ZPRM JCL was updated to support the CONNSWAP
   parameter.
   
   
   The WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 Infocenter will be updated at
   section:
   > WebSphere MQ

   >>> Configuring z/OS
   >>>> Customizing your queue managers
   >>>>> Task 17: Tailor your system parameter module
   
   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/
   com.ibm.mq.doc/zs10580_.htm)
   
   as follows:
   
   
   In the table, Table 1. Default values of CSQ6SYSP parameters,
   add one line:
   
   Parameter:     CONNSWAP
   Description:   Specifies whether jobs that are issuing certain
                  MQ API calls are swappable or non-swappable.
   Default value: YES
   Set command:   -
   
   
   After the table, Table 1. Default values of CSQ6SYSP parameters,
   add a section for the new parameter:
   
   CONNSWAP
   
   Specifies whether jobs that are issuing certain MQ API calls are
   swappable or non-swappable.
   
   Specify one of:
     No:
       Jobs are non-swappable during certain MQ API calls.
     Yes:
       Jobs are swappable during all MQ API calls.
   
   The default is YES.
   Use this parameter if low-priority jobs get swapped out whilst
   holding MQ resources other jobs or tasks might be waiting for.
   This parameter replaces the service parm that was introduced
   in V6/V701 by PK91707/PK97354. The service parm is no longer in
   use.

   section:

   >> Script (MQSC) Command Reference
   >>> The MQSC commands
   >>>> DISPLAY SYSTEM
   
   In 1. a bullet point with the following is added:
   
   "
   Whether batch jobs can currently be swapped out during some MQ
   API calls or not (CONNSWAP).
