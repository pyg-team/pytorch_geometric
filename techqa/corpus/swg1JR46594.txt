ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Rest Call to get the Process Instance Data results in an Error
   if the Process Instance has Variables which where not
   initialized yet. A UndeclaredVariableRuntimeException can be
   found in the log files.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the REST API retrieves the data for the process instance
   details call
   also the content of all local variables will be retrieved. If a
   variable
   is not yet initialized this results in a
   UndeclaredVariableRuntimeException
   which cause that the REST API call fails with an error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this interim fix the process instance details REST API call
   can now deal
   with variables which are not initialized. Variables that are not
   initialized
   will contain no data in the response of the process instance
   details REST API.
   
   Problem will be fixed with V8012
