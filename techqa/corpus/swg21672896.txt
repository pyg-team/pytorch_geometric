QUESTION
 How Do You Scan From Multiple Directories and Create Multiple Batches at the same time in IBM Datacap?

For example:: one application, two ingestion folders, and multiple batches created. 

ANSWER
 

 1. In Datacap Studio, create a new VScan Ruleset with a unique name (For example: VScan2) and have action SetSourceDirectory (C:\AnotherScanDirectory) point to a new directory. 
 2. Create a new Task Profile by going to the Task Profiles Tab and selecting New --> Custom --> Unique Name (For Example: VScan2). 
 3. Add the new Ruleset from step 1 to the new profile from step 2. 
 4. Add the Rule which is located under the Ruleset from step 1 to the Document hierarchy (DCO) under Batch --> Open. 
 5. In TMWeb, add the workflow and tasks (name the task the same name as in the Studio task profile from step 2). The workflow should be descriptive of the ingestion location - such as BillingDepartment or California. You will need to add all other tasks.
    For example: 
    ApplicationName – Custom APT
    Workflow1 – Single Page Scan 
    ScanTask1 - VScan 
    BackgroundTask – Batch Profiler 
    VerifyTask - Verify 
    ExportTask - Export 
    Workflow2 – Single Page Scan 2
    ScanTask2 – AutoScan 
    BackgroundTask – Batch Profiler 
    VerifyTask - Verify 
    ExportTask - Export 
 6. In the Application Manager Rulerunner tab, add the new task profile name from step 2. For example: Task = VScan2, and Profile = VScan2. The task is the same as the workflow task. The profile is the same as the task profile in Studio and should have the same name. 
 7. In Rulerunner, add the new workflow tasks to threads. Set property SkipSameBatch to 1 for VScan2.
