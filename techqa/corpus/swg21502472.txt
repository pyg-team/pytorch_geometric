PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Request data for JBoss is not visible in Tivoli Enterprise Portal for a system using JVM version 1.6 

CAUSE
By default, the JVM version 1.6 does not support loading array objects when doing a call of myClassLoader.loadClass(className). Some versions of JBoss do not function correctly in this case.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the following setting to the run.conf file: 

-Dsun.lang.ClassLoader.allowArraySyntax=true

Alternatively, install the latest cumulative patch for JBoss. It can contain a fix to this problem.
