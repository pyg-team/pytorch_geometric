 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am having trouble running the sample source programs (QRDARS/QSAMPLES/QRLSASRPG2) on the iSeries for OnDemand AnyStore APIs. 

CAUSE
In the source files in library QRDARS the sample RPG program specifies incorrect AnyStore program names on the call calc specifications. 

ANSWER
Change the source code to call the correct AnyStore program names. Chapter 4 of the OnDemand Administration Guide does reflect the correct OPM program names and ILE service program names and procedure names. An online copy of the guide is available at http://www.software.ibm.com/data/ondemand/400/library.html [http://www.software.ibm.com/data/ondemand/400/library.html] 

 
You'll need to change the following:
from QRLSCASO to QRLRCASO 
from QRLSOASO to QRLROASO
from QRLSRASL to QRLRRASL
from QRLSRASS to QRLRRASS
from QRLSSASS to QRLRSASS
