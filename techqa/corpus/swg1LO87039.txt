ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Connections: Android App: RejectUntrustedCertificates=true
   
   ENVIRONMENT
   ============
   Linux
   IBM Connections 5.0 CR2 / CR3 Page 19 of 21
   Connections Mobile App for Android V5.1.0
   
   ISSUE
   ====
   
   Customer set property "RejectUntrustedCertificates=true" in
   mobile- config.xml to make sure that the mobile application
   cannot connect to a  server which presents an untrusted SSL
   certificate. This is to avoid a  man in the middle attack while
   connecting to the Connection server.
   
   This mechanism does work fine with the Connections iOS app but
   seems to be ignored by the Android app.
   
   Here the output of the SecurityConfiguration to proof that the
   parameter "RejectUntrustedCertificates=true" has been set and
   is  working correctly:
   
   Command:
   
   wget --no-check-certificate -U "Lotus Android"
   --http-user=userid --
   http-password=passw0rd --header "X-IBMCONM: IBM Connections;
   5.1.0.2015100610; Android_908e0173580602ae;"
   https://ic50.urspringer- [https://ic50.urspringer-]
   net.de/mobile/homepage/SecurityConfiguration
   cat SecurityConfiguration
   
   Output:
   {"InfoPagePositivePathPattern":"(.*)\\\/terms\\\/accept(.*)","
   InfoPageNegativePathPattern":"(.*)\\\/terms\\\/decline(.*)","
   RejectUntrustedCertificates":"true","InfoPagePathPattern":"(.*)
   \/terms\\.html(.*)"}
   
   Now the steps to reproduce:
   - Delete the IBM Connections mobile app from your device
   (Important as
   it seems that SSL certificates are cached so deleteing the app
   makes
   sure you have a clean test envrionment) and reinstall it
   
   - Start the Mobile App and add an account via HTTPS to a server
   which does have an untrusted certificate (e.g. a self signed
   certificate)
   
   - If you try to connect to will get the message that the
   identity of the server cannot be verified. Proceed with the
   connection.
   
   - You will get an error message telling you that there is a
   problem with authentication (here you should already get a
   better message telling you that the servers certificate is
   untrusted; you get this better message on iOS)
   
   - If you confirm that message and try to connect again you then
   can connect without any further error message and you will
   never be asked later again if you want to trust that
   certificate.
   
   So if you set "RejectUntrustedCertificates=true" you should
   NEVER be able to connect to that server even if the user
   answers that he wants to ignore the certificate warning (that
   is how iOS correctly works ...)
   
   The customer security team found that during a pen test session
   and they need to shutdown mobile access for Android devices if
   this will not be fixed ASAP. This would have impact to several
   thousand users who would not be able to connect to Connections
   with their mobile device.
   
   I guess that the same issue will happen also with the Blackberry
   application (the customer is using many of these devices as
   well) so we need to check and if needed correct this also for
   Blackberry.
   
   SEV1 because security team told us to shutdown mobile access if
   we cannot present a fast solution.
