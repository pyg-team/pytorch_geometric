APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a malicious SSL client connects to a DataPower service that
   is acting as an SSL server then that client can keep the SSL
   handshake going indefinitely by sending certain message
   sequences over and over.  SSL clients that follow the
   protocol specification will not trigger this behavior.
   
   This problem is known as CVE-2011-4619.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A malicious SSL client connecting to the DataPower SSL server
   could cause the SSL handshake to keep looping indefinitely by
   sending certain message sequences indefinitely.
   
   Support for the alternate SGC (Server-Gated Cryptography)
   handshake was missing a check that the handshake had only been
   restarted for SGC one time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 4.0.1.10 and 4.0.2.6.
