Title: IBM IIDR Recovery After Database Crash - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have defined a persistent connection, our database crashed but the connection was not re-established when we restarted it. Under certain circumstances, the system does recover from lost database connectivity. Why are we seeing this and how should we plan for outages? 

CAUSE
If your database goes down and is restarted, you should restart the instance. There are some cases where the instance will try to start up automatically but it's not complete, isn't supported, and you should not expect it. It's better to work under the belief that database restart/crash requires an instance restart. If there is a network failure or connections are snipped for some reason but database is running, then the system will try to reestablish the connection if it's defined as persistent.

ANSWER
This is working as designed but there is an enhancement request open to modify the behavior.
