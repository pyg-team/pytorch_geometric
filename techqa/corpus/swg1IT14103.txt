APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HL7 response messages (such as acknowledgements) are rejected by
   the HL7DFDLOutput node if the MSH.9 Message Type field contains
   only a single component. HL7 v2.5 and onwards require three
   components for MSH.9, but earlier versions support fewer
   components. This fix adds support for a single component for
   MSH.9 for messages received by the HL7DFDLOutput node.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack v4.0 that
   use the HL7DFDLOutput node, and use an HL7 DFDL model that
   supports a single component for the MSH.9 Message Type field.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows on x86-64 platform, Linux on x86-64 platform

   the HL7DFDLOutput node if the MSH.9 Message Type field contains
   only a single component. HL7 v2.5 and onwards require three
   components for MSH.9, but earlier versions support fewer

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If the HL7 DFDL model used by the HL7DFDLOutput node supports a
   single component for the MSH.9 Message Type field, then response
   messages received by the HL7DFDLOutput node will not be rejected
   because the MSH.9 field contains a single component.
