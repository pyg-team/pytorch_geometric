ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Calculating the total weight of a weldment.
   Symptoms and Step-by-Step:
   1. Create a multi-bodied CATPart and apply a steel material to
   it. ( Two cubes of different sizes will work fine )
   2. By using the contextual menu query the properties panel of
   the part and view the weight of the part.
   3. Now assemble the two bodies together and query the properties
   panel and view the weight.
   4. Note the increase of the weight due to the 2 bodies being
   assembled.
   5. This means we must assemble all the bodies in a CATPart to
   acquire the total weight.
   6. You cannot reorder the bodies so it is impossible to get the
   weight of the other bodies.
   7. The work around of assembling all the bodies of a 20 or more
   bodied part is very time consuming,if the system lets you
   assemble them.
   8. We would also like to see the ability to apply a different
   material to separate part bodies in a single CATPart.
   9. This would eliminate the need for so many separate files
   and links thus keeping things easier.
   10.It will take many more files, sub-assemblies, sub-assemblies
   inside of sub-assemblies to create the same result assembly
   just because of material types.
   11.The work around today, is today we have to create very
   complex assembly structures when they could be very simple.
   Thus making the code look hard to use.

COMMENTS
 *  THIS APAR IS CONSIDERED AS A SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR
   CATIA.
   PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPORT DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO OPEN A
   REQUIREMENT FORM.
   
   As discussed in Paris with Jacques Leveille (18th november
   meeting),
   we are going to go in this direction on V5R5 :
   1) give access to weight computation on individual bodies
   (will be done by "measure" team)
   2) give the capability to put a material to a particular body
   in order to be able to build "mulkti-material parts" :
   not yet planned
   but maybe integrated in development plan after customer/DS
   discussion.
