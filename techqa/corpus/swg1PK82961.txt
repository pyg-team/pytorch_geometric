ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running CICS TS 32 with the intent of its WEB usage
   being an HTTPS client program that gets info only. In CICS TS
   32 with SSL active, and you do the following command to test
   the client SSL handshake with a remote active server which
   also supports other non-CICS client requests:
   CECI WEB OPEN HTTPS HOST('ww.xx.yy.zz') HOSTL(nn)
   to simulate a client program to determine that your HTTPS
   connection as client works okay.
   You get a IOERR EIBRESP=+0000000017 EIBRESP2=+0000000042 status
   along with the following DFHSO0123 message in the CSOO TDQ which
   seems to have invalid content about client IP address which
   infact the server IP address that your client was trying to
   connect to
   DFHSO0123 mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss  Return code 8 received
   from function 'gsk_secure_socket_init' of System SSL.
   Reason: Server certificate rejected by client. Client:
   xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, TCPIPSERVICE: *NONE*.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Message DFHSO0123 is misleading when    *
   *                      issued following a failure where CICS   *
   *                      is acting as an SSL client.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   CICS issued MSGDFHSO0123 after an SSL handshake failure. CICS
   was acting as the client and message DFHSO0123 stated that the
   reason for the failure was 'Server certificate rejected by
   client'. The message also included the Client IP address. This
   was actually the IP address of the remote server. The message
   appeared to imply that CICS was treating the remote peer as a
   client rather than a server. This left the message open to
   misinterpretation and suggested that the remote peer was
   rejecting a certificate which was not the case.
