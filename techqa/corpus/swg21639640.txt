PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Java 6â„¢ on WebSphere Application Server V8.5 reaches end of service (EOS) in April 2018. For more information, see the "Software withdrawal and service discontinuance: IBM WebSphere Application Server V7 and V8 and select IBM WebSphere products and part numbers - Some replacements available" announcement (http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/3/897/ENUS916-143/index.html&request_locale=en [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/3/897/ENUS916-143/index.html&request_locale=en]). 

Extended support is not offered for Java 6, so you should use Java 7 or Java 8 instead. If Java 7 is not supported on your current version, you must upgrade to IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.7 and IBM Business Monitor V8.5.7. If Java 8 is not supported on your current version, you must upgrade to IBM BPM V8.6.

IBM BPM zOS V8.5.0.2 supports Java 7.1 (IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5.5 as a prerequisite). 

IBM Process Designer in IBM BPM V8.5.7.0 CF 2017.03 or later versions is bundled with Java 7. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the appropriate Java version for the version of IBM BPM or IBM Business Monitor you are using: 

Product version Supported Java version IBM BPM V8.6 Java 8* IBM BPM V8.5.7.0 Java 6 or Java 7* IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 Java 6 or Java 7* IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 Java 6 IBM BPM V8.5.0.x Java 6 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639640&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639640&amp;aid=1] IBM Business Monitor V8.5.7.0 Java 6 or Java 7* Business Monitor V8.5.6.0 Java 6 or Java 7* Business Monitor V8.5.5.0 Java 6 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639640&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639640&amp;aid=1] *Java snippets, Java conditions, and Java expressions in BPEL processes must use Java 6 constructs instead of Java 7 or Java 8 constructs.
