ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   ITM 6.2 FP1 and above.
     Install component, TEPS component.
   
   Problem Description:
     When the TEPS is configured to use LDAP authentication and to
     use DB2 for the database, the JVM is not started and
     authentication fails.
     This is caused by the KFW_STARTJVM variable being set to NO in
     the config/kcqenv file.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
     Install TEPS
     Configured TEPS without LDAP enabled.
     Start TEPS/TEP
     You are able to login via desktop client
     Stop TEPS
     Configure LDAP via MTEMS GUI
     Start TEPS, LDAP configuration fails.
     Stop TEPS
     Reconfigure TEPS with LDAP settings via command line.
     Start TEPS/TEP
     Unable to login via desktop client, internal error occurred.
     JVM was not started.
     In /opt/IBM/ITM/logs/cq.env, you can see the KFW_STARTJVM=NO
     setting.
   
   Related Files and Output:
     No logs gathered. This is the same problem as internal defect
     77821 which is fixed in 6.2.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server configuration code is
   setting the value of KFW_STARTJVM to "NO", rather than "YES". Up
   until IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.2 Fix Pack 1, "NO" was correct but
   changes to LDAP integration necessitate that the value be set to
   "YES" starting with fix pack 1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to set the KFW_STARTJVM value to "YES"
   during the portal server configuration.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
      | interim fix | 6.2.0.3-TIV-ITM-IF0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually edit the kcqenv file after running the portal server
   configuration and change the value of KFW_STARTJVM from "NO" to
   "YES".
