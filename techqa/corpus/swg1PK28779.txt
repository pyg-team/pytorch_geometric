APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following exception is thrown while doing a remote ORB
   call (JNDI lookup, EJB method call)...
   
   Error during resolve. Root exception is
   org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT: No available target vmcid:
   0x49421000 minor code: 40 completed: No
   at
   com.ibm.ws.cluster.router.selection.SelectionManager.getTarget(S
   electionManager.java:264)
   at
   com.ibm.ws.cluster.router.selection.WLMClientForCommonRouterImpl
   .getNextTarget(WLMClientForCommonRouterImpl.java:221)
   
   The symptom above may also include high CPU utilization due to
   excessive ORB traffic between the Nodeagent and AppServer
   hosting the client

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Server users doing     *
   *                 remote ORB calls on version 6.0.2, using     *
   *                 Workload Management (WLM).                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: NO_IMPLEMENT: No Available Target when  *
   *                      doing a remote ORB call, which was      *
   *                      caused by improper posting and routing  *
   *                      of WLM data through the bulletin board. *

   hosting the client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem was caused because cluster members could at times
   post local data (data only they care about and use) to the
   bulletin board.  This data would then get propagated and
   possibly overwrite local data on other cluster members.
   This in turn could cause selection problems because of the
   inconsistent and incorrect data.
   
   The fix was to prevent the posting of this kind of local data
   to the bulletin board.  This problem has already been fixed in
   version 6.1, this APAR is the backport of that fix to
   version 6.0.2.
   
   The fix is currently targeted for the 6.0.2.17 fixpack.
