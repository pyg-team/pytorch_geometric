Text:
gskit; CVE-2013-6747; CVE-2014-6221 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM Rational DOORS. The GSKit that is shipped with Rational DOORS contains multiple security vulnerabilities including the â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. Rational DOORS has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6221 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6221]
DESCRIPTION: Random Data Generation using GSKit MSCAPI/MSCNG Interface Code does not generate cryptographically random data. An attacker could use this weakness to gain complete confidentially and/or integrity compromise. 

CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

9.6.1.1 9.6.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039550] 
For Rational DOORS version 9.2.x and earlier, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. If you are using Rational DOORS Web Access, after you upgrade but before you start the Rational DOORS Web Access server, edit the core configuration file and set the required version of the interoperation server to the version of the fix pack upgrade, as described in this procedure. 

Procedure: 

 1. To edit the Rational DOORS Web Access core configuration file, open the festival.xml file, which is in the server\festival\config directory.
    
    
 2. Add the following line in the <f:properties> section:
    
    <f:property name="interop.version" value="9.n.n.n"/>
    
    Replace "9.n.n.n" with the version of the fix pack upgrade: 9.3.0.10, 9.4.0.4, 9.5.0.4, 9.5.1.5, 9.5.2.4, 9.6.0.3, or 9.6.1.2.
    
    
 3. Save and close the file. 


After this revision, only the specified version of the interoperation server can access the Rational DOORS database.
