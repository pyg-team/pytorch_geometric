SDA TEPS "support files" SOA 7.2 FP1 ifix 5 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is my product support not being updated on TEPS (It's updated on TEMS) - from 7.2.0.1-TIV-ITCAMSOA-AIX-IF0005.tar. 

CAUSE
 SOA includes an SDA package for the TEMS but not for TEPS.

ANSWER
Basically, it is working as it is coded for this version. 

 User has to manually apply SOA 7.2 FP1 ifix 5 support files on TEPS. 

 Doc Apar IV77933 is created to provide this information. 

 

NOTE: 
All version of ITCAM for SOA 7.2 requires to apply support files manually on TEPS. 
None of the 7.2 installers include SDA support for TEPS. It is not limited to 7.2.0.1-TIV-ITCAMSOA-IF0005.
