Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere eXtreme Scale   (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects WebSphere eXtreme Scale version 7.1.0, 7.1.1, 8.5, and 8.6. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

See Workarounds and Mitigation section below. Verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For WebSphere eXtreme Scale versions 7.1.0, 7.1.1 and 8.5 stand-alone environments, apply the appropriate fix to upgrade your JDK. These fixes update the Java 6 to the appropriate version where RC4 can be turned off. Follow the instructions for disabling RC4 algorithm. For WebSphere eXtreme Scale V8.6 stand-alone environment, the Java shipped already supports disabling of the RC4 algorithm. You only need to change thejava.security file as described.

Disable RC4 algorithm 

 1. Edit thejava.security file and turn off RC4 by adding the following setting: jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3,RC4 
 2. When you run WebSphere eXtreme Scale in a WebSphere Application Server profile, follow the instructions for WebSphere Application Server described here: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503] 
 3. When you run WebSphere eXtreme Scale in a WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile versions V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.5 Full Profile and you are configured for FIPS140-2, Suite B or SP800-131, your SSL communication for Liberty is not affected by this vulnerability. If you are not running in a WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile that is configured for one of these security options, you can either enable FIPS 140-2 in Liberty or update the profile by following the instructions described here: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503].
