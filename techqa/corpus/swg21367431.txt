PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User clicks 'Group - Consolidate with Status'. User starts a consolidation. However, when the user opens the batch queue afterwards, they notice that the consolidation job has failed with an error message. 

If the end user disables the batch queue, then a different error message appears on the screen. 

SYMPTOM
Batch queue details: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Method '~' of object '~' failed


Screen (if the batch queue is disabled):  * 
 * 
 * Standard Error
 * 
 * 
 * 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * (0x800A01B8): 
 * Automation error
 * 
 * RunConsol
 * 
 * 
 * 



CAUSE
There are several potential causes for similar errors: 

 

 * Scenario #1 - The Controller application server has run out of system resources (memory etc.)  * Typically this is caused by a memory leak (building up over time).
   
   
 * Scenario #2 - The Controller environment has been configured to have a dedicated 'COGNOSVFP' consolidation COM+ package/application  * However, there is a problem with this package. 
   
   
 * Scenario #3 - Customer has modified the "Memory Limit" setting inside the "Application Recycling" section for the COM+ application (for example "COGNOSVFP") which is running the consolidation processes.  * For more details see separate IBM Technote #1502814.
   
   
 * Scenario #4 - Controller application server has a problem reading the VFP DLL file components.  * For more details see separate IBM Technote #1442198.
   
   

ENVIRONMENT
Scenario #2 - Controller has been set up with a separate application server for consolidation *or* the consolidation components have been isolated into a separate COM+ package.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Scenario #1: 

 * Fix - Upgrade to latest version of Controller, to take advantage of latest memory leak fixes. 
 * Workaround - Reboot the Controller application server (to resolve the problem in the short term)  * Customers may also benefit from isolating the consolidation components into a separate COM+ package (by convention called 'COGNOSVFP'), to provide even greater stability. 
    * For instructions, see separate IBM Technote #1440369.
   
   


Scenario #2: 
Make sure that the settings (especially the configured 'identity') for the COM+ application/package' called 'COGNOSVFP' is correct.  * For more information, see separate article IBM Technote #1367281.


Scenario #3: 
See separate IBM Technote #1502814. 

Scenario #4:
