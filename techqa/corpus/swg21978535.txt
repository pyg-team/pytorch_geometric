Title: IBM Known Issue: Properties Widget PropertyTable related events don't fire upon removing a row in IE browser - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Events related to the Properties Widget PropertyTable don't fire when you remove a row in the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.


SYMPTOM
When you delete or remove a row from the PropertyTable, the following events should be fired:
icm.cellRemoved; icm.CellUpdated; icm.RowRemoved; icm.RowUpdated; icm.PropertyUpdated


Actual result:
None of these events fire if you are using the IE browser. In the developer tool console, IE shows the following error: "Object doesn't support property or method 'parseInt' in ecm.js.gz:56287:21." 


CAUSE
IE11 does support the Number.parseInt function, but it has a global function that is to be used.

Per Mozilla, Javascript does support a Number.parseInt function (which performs identically to global parseInt), but IE does not support it.

ENVIRONMENT
ICM 5.2.1.3 FP003; ICM 5.2.1.4 FP004; ICN 2.0.3.6 FP006; ICN 2.0.3.7 FP007



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open the developer tools and check console for errors.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use browser other than IE to test your customization. The fix will be available with the release of IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3.8 Fix Pack 8.
