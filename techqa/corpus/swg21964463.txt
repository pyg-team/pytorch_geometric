Title: IBM Tivoli Integrated Portal WebGroup/virtual host not defined - United States

Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2CONF; TIPL2SEC; WebGroup/virtual host ; not defined TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While launching TIP (Tivoli Integrated Portal) using below URL, the following error is occurring.

https://lab-server1.ibm.com:16310

SRVE0255E: A WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle / has not been defined. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In earlier versions of TIP you could use a URL like below to launch TIP. In TIP 1.x version root context (ibm/console) was optional. 

https://lab-server1.ibm.com:16310

In TIP 2.1, 2.2 and later versions we don't have a redirect servlet, so a context root is required. Therefore ibm/console must be added at the end of URL, otherwise you will get above error. Also make sure ibm/console is case sensitive. So a valid URL to launch TIP is shown below. You need to change the server name and port number depending on your implementation.
