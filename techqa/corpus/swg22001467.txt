QUESTION
 Is PostgresSQL supported by IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture? 

ANSWER
IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture provides an IIDR Flex Rep agent that supports some PostgresSQL drivers . However, it needs to be considered that this can only be used for target agents. 
The Flex Reap agent can be used for a number of 3rd party JDBC Drivers as it is a generic engine. 
That means however, that some of the apply optimizations for refresh processing are not included, which may mean a performance penalty.
FlexRep was introduced for MySQL and Postgres SQL.. So this is a JDBC implementation. not a single Vendor Platform.
