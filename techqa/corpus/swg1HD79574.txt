ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running PLMV4ToV5Migration on a session file
   the migration process takes very long time and the
   CPU usage goes to 100%
   Scenario :-
   Set the following Environment Variables:
   DRWV4IFILTERWIREFRAME=1
   DrwTransViewToSpec=1
   CATV4V5ReportNew=1
   Use PLMV4ToV5Migration to convert .session to V5
   - Tools + Utilities
   - Double click PLMV4ToV5Migration
   - Choose Input (.session)
   - Use As Spec Conversion for entire list
   - Use Solid and Ditto as Structuring element.
   - Choose Output location
   - Accept all other Defaults
   - Run
   RESULT: 1) The migration takes very long time and
   at times is never completed
   2) The CPU usage goes to 100%
   EXPECTED RESULT : -
   1) The migration process should not take long time
   2) The CPU usage should not be 100%
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 20 GA LEVEL.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED
   ON V5R19SP04 AND ON V5R18SP08
   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS: -
   When running PLMV4ToV5Migration on a session
   file the migration process takes very long time and
   the CPU usage goes to 100
   CORRECTION EXPLANATION: -
   The problem was occurring  due to the Report
   storage and is now resolved
   The migration is proper now with the batch taking
   less time for completion and
   CPU usage not staying at 100 percent
   BYPASS:-
   None
