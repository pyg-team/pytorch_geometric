applet; browser FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 The Microsoft Edge browser does not support plug-ins or Rich Text functionality. 

CONTENT
The Microsoft Edge browser does not support plug-ins. All the IBM Maximo 7.6 applets (Direct print, Workflow designer, Asset Topology viewer, and Graphical Scheduler) cannot be used with the Edge browser. Use an alternative browser such as Internet Explorer 11 until IBM Maximo 7.6 is updated to add this support.
One of the components that Maximo depends on for Rich Text support is not supported for the Edge browser. Use an alternative browser such as Internet Explorer 11 until IBM Maximo 7.6 is updated to add this support.
