 MANUAL

ABSTRACT
 You can upgrade the IBM Datacap software to V9.1 if your application uses SQL Server database. 

CONTENT
Before you begin


 1. Back up your Datacap application folders. 
 2. If you modified any of the standard Datacap applications, make a backup of those folders also. 
 3. On each computer that you are upgrading, uninstall Datacap V9.0. (Uninstalling Datacap V9.0 preserves the files that you added or modified).

Procedure 
To upgrade Datacap applications from V9.0 to V9.1, complete the following steps:  1. Install Datacap V9.1. 
 2. If you modified any of the standard applications in Datacap V9.0 such as the Accounts Payable application, you might want to preserve those changes. To do so, restore those application folders from the backups. 
 3. If your application uses DB2, SQL Server, or Oracle databases, update the database schemas to Datacap V9.1 "in place" (without removing an existing older version): SQL Server a. Create full backups of the Admin, Engine, and Fingerprint database tables.
    b. Start SQL Server Management Studio.
    c. Connect to the application's databases.
    d. Execute the following scripts in the \Datacap\support\DBScript\ folder:
    · SQL_Adm_Upd901.sql
    · SQL_Eng_Upd901.sql
    · SQL_FP_Upd901.sql 

4. If your application contains any of the following rulesets, copy the updated versions from the \Datacap\rrs folder to your application's Rules folder. For example, your application’s Rules folder might be \Datacap\TravelDocs\dco_TravelDocs\Rules\. Ruleset File to copy Populate Fields Using Keywords Populate_Fields_Using_Keywords.Rul.dll ExportToBoxRul ExportToBoxRul.dll ImportFromBoxRul ImportFromBoxRul.dll RecognizePagesAndFieldsRul RecognizePagesAndFieldsRul.dll 5.
