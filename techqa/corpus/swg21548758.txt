QUESTION
 How many SNMP traps can be defined for Connect:Direct OS/390 ? (SCI56782) 

ANSWER
Connect:Direct OS/390 can set traps for a maximum of 127 Connect:Direct and user messages.

The maximum number of SNMP user traps that can be set is 66. Traps are defined in a dataset specified via the initialization parameter SNMP.DSN. A sample SNMP.DSN dataset is shipped in hlqs.SAMPLIB(CDSNMP) and contains all the predefined Connect:Direct traps. These set 61 traps leaving space for 66 user traps . A full list of the Connect:Direct predefined traps and the messages associated with the traps can be found in the manual "Connect:Direct for OS/390 Administration Guide - Chapter 9: Configuring SNMP Support". 

Note 1: 

During Connect:Direct OS/390 initialization, module DNINSNMP GETMAIN's 8K bytes for the SNMP trap table and adds a 64 byte entry for each Connect:Direct and user message that will be trapped. The message "SITA632W SNMP Trap Table is full" will be generated if you try to add more than 127 Connect:Direct and user messages to the SNMP trap table.

Note 2:

A enhancement request to increase the size of the SNMP Trap Table to 12K to allow 191 Connect:Direct and user messages to be trapped is being considered.
