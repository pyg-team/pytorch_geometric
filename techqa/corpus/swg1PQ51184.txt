ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When installing a new level of the OPC NT TRACKER AGENT on a
   machine where a prior level of the T/A has previously been
   installed, the old T/A and its associated NuTCRACKER service
   must both be removed before the new ones can be installed.
   The process of UNINSTALLING the NuTCRACKER and TRACKER AGENT
   code and services is SEQUENCE SENSITIVE...  The correct steps
   must be performed in the proper sequence or the removal will be
   incomplete and the following install will not succeed.
   .
   The following procedure has been extensively tested and works
   correctly on all machines on which it has been used.
   .
   It assumes the "old" version of the TRACKER AGENT is correctly
   installed and fully functional before you begin.  It further
   assumes that the entire process is done while logged on to the
   NT system as ADMINISTRATOR.
   .
   1. Before starting, be certain to make copies of any files
      in the existing TRACKER directory or any of its
      subdirectories which you wish to save.  In particular, be
      sure to save the T/A configuration file in the \TRACKER\ETC
      directory (the name of this file is indicated by the
      EQQINSTANCE SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT variable).
   2. Stop the TRACKER service.
   3. From a command prompt, issue the command " eqqsrv -remove "
      (If the \TRACKER\BIN directory is not in the system path,
      you will have to CD to that directory prior to issuing this
      command).
   4. From a command prompt, issue the command " eqqclean " to
      delete the contents of the \TRACKER\LOG and the \TRACKER\TMP
      directories.
   5. Stop the NuTCRACKER service.
   6. From a command prompt, issue the command " nutsrv4 -remove "
   7. REBOOT the NT system. THIS STEP IS MANDATORY!!
   8. From a command prompt, CD to the \TRACKER\NUTC directory and
      issue the command " deldll ".  This will remove all the old
      NuTCRACKER files from the WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory.
   9. Delete or rename the \TRACKER directory.
   10.UNZIP the file containing the INSTALLATION IMAGE for the NEW
      level of the TRACKER AGENT.  Specify the ROOT directory as
      your target and be certain to check the "USE FOLDERNAMES"
      option.
   11.From a command prompt, CD to the \TRACKER\NUTC directory
      just created by UNZIPPING the TRACKER AGENT install file
      and issue the command " copydll "
   12.CD to the C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory and issue the command
      " nutsrv4 -install "
   13.Start the NuTCRACKER service.
   14.From a command prompt, issue the command
      " eqqsrv -install -verbose "  If the \TRACKER\BIN directory
      is not in the system path, you will have to CD to that
      directory before issuing this command.
   15.Configure the newly installed TRACKER service (set startup
      options including userid, password, etc.).
   16.Copy your backup of the TRACKER AGENT CONFIGURATION FILE into
      the \TRACKER\ETC directory.
   17.Start the newly installed TRACKER service and verify
      operation.

   |1. Before starting, be certain to make copies of any files    |

   |11.From a command prompt, CD to the tracker NUTC directory    |
   |   just created by UNZIPPING the tracker agent install file   |
