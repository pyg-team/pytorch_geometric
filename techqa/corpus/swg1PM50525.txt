   In the DXL manual under the button() perm it states:
   
   "
   On Windows platforms, if label contains an ampersand (?),
   the character after the ? is underscored, which creates a
   shortcut key for use with the ALT key.
   "
   
   This hasn't worked since at least v5.2, so it should be
   removed from the manual.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed so that the error no longer occurs
   in this scenario.
