    * If your clients connect to IHS via SSL (which then redirects their connections to WAS), then review this IHS bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701072] and apply fixes or remediations to your server. 
    *  
    * If your clients connect directly to WAS with SSL, then review this bulletin for instructions on applying a mitigation or fix to your WAS installation and your ClearCase profile:
      Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503].

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

For unsupported versions, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
