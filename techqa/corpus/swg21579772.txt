QUESTION
 I have created an application with User Defined data type of extension PDF, and I'm using the Generic indexer to archive my data. I've created an .IND file in the IFS but when I try to add the report to OnDemand, I receive the error message "Invalid generic index file format: > <" in both the system log 88 message and in the joblog as a CPF9898. What am I doing wrong? 

CAUSE
It's possible that your .IND file is either the wrong Coded Character Set ID (CCSID) or it contains blank lines.

ANSWER
To check the CCSID, to make sure it matches the CCSID specified for the instance owner, do the following: 

1. Use WRKLNK to put an 8 next to the .IND file. Look for "Coded character set ID".
2. If the CCSID shows a value other than the value of the instance user profile (e.g., QUSROND) or 1252 to indicate it came from the PC, change it. You can do this by using option 2 next to the .IND file and then pressing the F15 key to change the CCSID.

To check to see if your .IND file has blank lines, do the following:

1. Use WRKLNK to put a 5 next to the .IND file. A correct .IND file should show:
COMMENT: Test Index file
CODEPAGE:37 
COMMENT: Index value #1 - First Name
GROUP_FIELD_NAME:FirstName
GROUP_FIELD_VALUE:Bob 
COMMENT: Index Value #2 - Middle Initial
GROUP_FIELD_NAME:MiddleInitial
(and so on.......) 
2. If you see blank lines between any of the index values or anywhere else in this file, you'll need to either remove them using a "D" to the left of the line or add the word "COMMENT:" at the beginning of the blank line.
