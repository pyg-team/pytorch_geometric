ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  steps to replicate in 7118:
   steps:
   
   go to chart of accounts app, go to actions menu, select gl
   component maintenance, select  ELEMENT, click new row, GL
   component value = invcost
   description = invcost
   click OK
   
   go to item master app
   create a new item called test2
   go to actions menu, add item to storeroom
   storeroom = CENTRAL
   standard cost = 0
   current balance = 1
   issue unit and order unit both are EACH
   click ok
   
   go back to actions menu, add Item to storeroom
   storeroom = PKG
   
   standard cost = 0
   current balance = 1
   issue unit and order unit both are EACH
   click ok
   
   tick condition enabled checkbox
   click New Row in the condition code section
   condition code = 9/16
   click new Row button again
   condition code = 11/32
   save
   
   change status to active
   
   go to the storerooms app
   PKG storeroom
   GL Control account = 6610-800-800
   
   CENTRAL storeroom
   GL Control account = 6600-800-800
   
   i.e. ControlAcc are different between these two Storerooms
   
   
   go to app designer, bring up inventor application, add 2 GL
   fields to the main inventory tab:
   go to the condition code section
   add a new text box,
   object = INVCOST
   attribute = CONTROLACC
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup
   add another text box
   add a new text box
   object = INVCOST
   attribute = GLACCOUNT
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup
   
   
   go to inventory, bring up item test2 from the central storerom
   
   for 9/16 condition code
   invcost controlacc = 6600-800-800
   INVCOST GLACCOUNT = ????-???-000-invcost
   
   for 11/32 condition code
   invcost controlacc = 6800-200-200
   INVCOST GLACCOUNT = ????-???-000-invcost
   
   bring up item test2 from the PKG storeroom
   go to inventory costs section, for condition code 9/16
   invcost controlacc = 6610-800-800
   invcost glaccount = ????-???-200-INVCOST
   
   for condition code 11/32
   invcost controlacc = 6610-800-800
   invcost glaccount = ????-???-200-INVCOST
   
   GO TO actions menu, issue current item
   
   When the Storeroom is changed from PKG to CENTRAL, the Credit GL
   is updated correctly to 6800-200-200
   
   After changing the Storeroom from PKG to CENTRAL, and then
   changing the Condition Code to 11/32
   
   tab out of the field, the Credit and Debit GL are being updated
   based on the InvCost
   record for the entered Condition on the CENTRAL Storeroom.
   
   i.e. gl debit and credit should get updated to
   ????-???-200-INVCOST
   6610-800-800
   
   but the GL remain as ????-???-000-INVCOST
   and 6610-800-800

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <This was fixed in code. The gldebitacct/glcreditacct were
   incorrectly gotten from the invcost record in the inventory
   record where the Issue Current Items is launched. This happened
   when storeroom and condition code are both changed. >
