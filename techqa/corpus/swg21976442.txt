 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 6 and 7 that are used by WebSphere eXtreme Scale. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016 and includes the vulnerability commonly referred to as “SLOTH” 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0475 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0475]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE Java SE Embedded and Jrockit related to the Libraries component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0448 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0448]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the JMX component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a partial confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.0 

WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.1 

WebSphere eXtreme Scale 8.5 

WebSphere eXtreme Scale 8.6

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Since MD5 signatures are no longer compatible with Java, installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients and servers that are running with an MD5 certificate. If any WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients or servers are configured with a certificate with an MD5 signature, they must be replaced prior to starting after upgrading to this interim fix. Failing to do so will result in the clients and servers failing to connect to each other. Note that client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.



<Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1 PI56344 Refer to the Version 7.1 table in the Recommended Fixes page for WebSphere eXtreme Scale [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991]. WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.1 8.5 

8.6

PI56341 Refer to the Version 7.1.1, 8.5, or 8.6 table in the Recommended Fixes page for WebSphere eXtreme Scale [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991]. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
No workaround exists. If you are running WebSphere eXtreme Scale standalone, apply the appropriate fix from the previous table. If you are running WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients or servers that are embedded in WebSphere Application Server, apply the appropriate fix for WebSphere Application Server, which is described here: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962931 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962931]
