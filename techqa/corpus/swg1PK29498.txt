APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In ClearCase Administrator's guide p.50, there's a section
   called "When to use a case-preserving MVFS".
   Here you are suggested to use "case-preserving mode (clear
   Case-Insensitive MVFS and select Case-Preserving)".  If you try
   to clear Case-Insensitive from control panel, you are not
   allowed to select Case-Preserving (because case sensitive means
   case preserving, too). This expression in the manual is not
   clear to our customers.  It should be changed something like
   "clear Case-Insensitive MVFS which selects Case-Preserving".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On p. 50 of the ClearCase Administrator's Guide (v7.0), the
   "When to use a case-preserving MVFS" section suggests using
   the following:
   "[Use] case-preserving mode (clear Case-Insensitive MVFS and
   select Case-Preserving)".
   However, clearing the Case-Insensitive check box on the
   control panel prevents you from selecting the
   Case-Preserving check box  (because case sensitive
   implicitly means case preserving).  Therefore, the content
   should be changed to something like, "clear Case-Insensitive
   MVFS, which selects Case-Preserving".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "When to use a case-preserving MVFS" section on p. 50 of
   the ClearCase Administrator's Manual now reads:
   "In the default mode (Case Insensitive MVFS enabled, Case
   Preserving disabled), the MVFS converts to lowercase the
   names of view-private files created in a dynamic view. This
   behavior can interfere with the operations of tools that
   intentionally create files with mixed-case names. For
   example, if a Java development environment creates a file
   named util.JAR in an MVFS environment that is not
   case-sensitive, it will be written as util.jar. Development
   tools that reference
   the file as util.JAR will not find it. To correct this kind
   of problem, configure the MVFS to use case-preserving mode
   (clear the
   Case-Insensitive MVFS check box)."
   The revised content will appear in a future version of the
   ClearCase Administrator's Manual.
