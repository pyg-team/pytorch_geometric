QUESTION
 Why is IBM Datacap NENU failing to return any recordsets? No error messages were returned, just zero recordsets. 

CAUSE
The customer was using the QuerySetStatus("Job Done") action in his Nenu application. The parameter for this action is case sensitive.

ANSWER
Changing the action call to QuerySetStatus("Job done") fixed the query string and allowed the proper number of items to be returned. 

Note: The easiest way to obtain the list of the available status for Datacap 8.1 is to run TMWeb.net for an application that has one or more batches, then view the batch(es) in the Job Monitor. Double click on the the batch number in the Batch column to bring up the Selected Batch Details window. Find the Status drop down box, and look at the available selections. This list contains the proper spellings of the available status that should be used with QuerySetStatus.
