APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the correlation of received delivery notifications in MSIF
   fails in MSIF due to the fact, that the transfer reference for
   the related SendFile Transfer is not known, Error events are
   created currently and the Delivery Notification is put to the
   backout queue.
   This causes unnecessary actions for the customer, as
   - the error events may cause callouts
   - there is no meaningful actions to handle the backed-out
   delivery notification rather then just deleting the messages.
   
   Therefore, handling of errors when correlating delivery
   notifications should be changed in a way that
   - the events are changed to informational
   - backout of the delivery notifications is omitted
   - when correlation via transfer reference is not possible,
   correlation should be tried via the logical filename, if this is
   included in the delivery notification, and new informational
   events should be written, if this correlation is successful.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ignore events DNFO2057E and DNFO1017E, and delete the backed-out
   delivery notifications from the backout queue
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If in an MSIF SendFile scenario for Realtime the
   delivery notification is received from the
   correspondent, then MSIF tries to correlate the
   delivery notification with the SendFile scenario using
   the SWIFT transfer reference. In error situations this
   correlation can fail, for example if the
   Sw:ExchangeFileResponse was lost or is received after
   the delivery notification.
   Formerly, in such error situations MSIF issued one of
   the events DNFO2056E or DNFO2057E and put the delivery
   notification into a backout queue, even if the
   recovery mechanism of the SendFile transfer
   automatically resolved the error situation later on.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, the correlation has been improved and the
   delivery notification is not put into the backout
   queue anymore. In a first step it is tried to
   correlate the delivery notification using the SWIFT
   transfer reference as before. If the first correlation
   fails, then it is tried to correlate the delivery
   notification using the logical file name. If the
   second correlation fails too, then one of the modified
   events DNFO2056I or DNFO2057I is issued. If the second
   correlation succeeds, then one of the new events
   DNFO2060I or DNFO2061I is issued that contain
   additional hints about the SendFile scenario.
