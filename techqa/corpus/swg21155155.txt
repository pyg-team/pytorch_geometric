Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Java applets do not load correctly when using jre v1.4.x 
For example, when accessing the Workflow creation applet, you can only view a small box in the upper right hand of the applet window. 

CAUSE
Java applets require 1.3.1_04 jre version.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Download jre 1.3.1_04 and install it so it will coexist with 1.4.2_02 version. 

2. Close browser, reopen it and check the IE > Tools > Internet Options > Advanced. Check to see which version of java is being used. Mine shows 1.4.2. 
3. Try to access the workflow applet page and you will be able to get it to load.
