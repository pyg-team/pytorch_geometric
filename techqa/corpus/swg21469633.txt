PROBLEM
When working on a partially created deployment plan, using the Sametime Integrated Solutions Console and a Firefox browser, you are unable to select the name of the deployment plan you want to work on. 

This issue was seen in two cases:

Log into the Sametime Integrated Solutions Console, using a Firefox web browser and 

1) Try to modify an Existing Deployment 

 *  Navigate to: Sametime System Console -> Sametime Guided Activities -> Install Sametime "X" Server. Click Modify an Existing Deployment plan and then try to click the deployment name => When you click the deployment name the button is NOT selected and the page refreshes with the same screen 


2) Try to Delete an Existing Deployment  *  Navigate to: Sametime System Console -> Sametime Guided Activities -> Install Sametime "X" Server. Click Modify an Existing Deployment plan and then try to click the deployment name => When you click the deployment name the button is NOT selected and the page refreshes with the same screen. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 This issue was seen when using Firefox 3.6.13 and was resolved by clearing the browser recent history and restarting the browser.

In the Firefox Browser navigate to: Tools -> Clear Recent History {or "Ctrl+Shift+Del"}
