PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you add a service repository in the IBM Installation Manager, you might get a Failed to connect repository error. 

SYMPTOM
You want to add the following repository, for example.

http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v7/rft/70 01/repository


 But you receive an Add Repository Error.

The full error message is as follows: 

 * 
   Failed to connect repository
   "http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/v7/rft/700 1/repository" 
   either because the repository does not exist, or the repository server can not be reached.
   
   Add this repository to the list anyway?

CAUSE
The error message is diagnostic. The URL does not exist. 

Note: There is a space between 700 and 1.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install form a local repository.



 1. Locate the download location from the download document of the packages that you want to install.
    
    
 2. Download the installation packages.
    
    
 3. Copy the archive file that you downloaded to a folder at will.
    
    
 4. Add the latter folder to the Installation Manager repositories.
    File > Preferences > Repositories.
    
    
 5. Test the connection to that repository.
    


 

 

Note: In this particular case you can add the repository after removing the space. The connection test will fail.
