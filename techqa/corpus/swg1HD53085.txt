   Format
   Second XML Format Type
   Filtering Clash Results
   .
   Additional Information:
   With "Federated XML output" turned off we
   have each file for different result and hence
   we have a link format in XLM result file. And
   with "XML Export for clash process purpose "
   checked ON filtering during export is not
   available.
