APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After running the manageprofiles command to remove the profile,
   the Remove Deployment Manager Profile plug-in step is deleting
   the profile directory. This logic causes a problem if the
   profile directory is on a mounted drive.
   
   Running manageprofiles
   command: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/manageprofiles.sh
   -delete -profileName dmgr -profilePath
   /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/DeploymentManager

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Version 4 of the WAS Install plug-in now allows users to avoid
   deleting the directory if needed.  The Remove Node Profile and
   Remove Deployment Manager Profile steps now include a Delete
   Profile Directory property.  If the user unchecks the Delete
   Profile Directory checkbox, the delete command will not be run.
   
   Version 4 of the WAS Install plug-in can be found here:
