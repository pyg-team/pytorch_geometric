Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I inserted the CD into my DVD/CD ROM Drive and clicked on the SPSS Statistics link or I navigate to the DVD/CD ROM Drive and click on the Setup.exe executable.
The following Windows Pop-Up Error dialog box entitled 'setup' was displayed.
"There was error executing the command 'SPSS Statistics\setup.exe'."
---OR---
Nothing at all happens. The computers DVD/CD ROM drive is unable to read the disc. It could be damaged or corrupt. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do you have the 'Original' CD-ROM media or is your a copy?
It is possible the setup files where not in the 'SPSS Statistics' folder on the duplicated CD-ROM.
Please check with your IT department to get another copy of the Software Media or use the Original Disc.
If this is the original disc then the Media may be corrupt or unable to be read by the DVD/CD ROM Drive. Please either contact IBM Client Care or your sales representative, for a CD-ROM replacement. 

You can contact Customer Client Care via E-Mail at Client Care (tsmail@us.ibm.com)
