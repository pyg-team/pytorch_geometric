Known limitations 
When any inbound adapter, say JDBC inbound adapter joins global transaction (e.g. JDBC inbound -> Mediation flow (mapper) or BPEL process -> JDBC outbound), and 'Interaction style' is set to sync mode, there is a likelihood that if the adapter is restarted multiple times, some events which are being processed may get lost. These events are removed from event table, but are not received by the downstream component. 


In z/OS environment, the Adapter for Flat File returns true for an Exists operation even though the directory under which files are kept does not have read permission. This issue occurs when the underlying WebSphere Application Server for WebSphere Process Server or WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus has been installed at the Super ID (UID=0) level and configured to use Super User ID for its runtime operations. Since the Adapter runs on the underlying WebSphere Application Server environment, it will use the Super ID at runtime. As Super User ID can access any folder irrespective of permission, the adapter will return the value as true.
