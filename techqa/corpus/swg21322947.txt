Title: IBM How to set WPG console timeout value - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can the timeout value for the WPG console be modified? 

CAUSE
The default session timeout value of 30 minutes may not be acceptable for some scenarios, e.g. 

 * Users in secure environments might need shorter session timeout periods to ensure security, in case they leave their machine and forget to log off the console. 
 * Users might need longer session timeout periods if they respond slower than typical users for accessibility reasons.


ANSWER
The timeout value for the WPG console can be set in the WAS admin console via Servers -> Application servers -> bcgserver -> Web Container Settings -> Web container -> Session management -> Session timeout. 

The value (default = 30) is provided in minutes.
