   authorizations window. After adding many users (for example 15)
   to TCR authorizations list, the users are hidden if you try to
   scroll the list. If you select the column header to change
   sorting (ASC/DESC), the users are displayed. This behavior
   occurs only in IE. TCR dojo table implementation was not
   correct.
