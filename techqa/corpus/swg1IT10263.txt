 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to use the ConfigManagerProxy Java admin classes to
   connect to a secured QueueManager using a TLS cipher
   suite/cipher spec combination then a MQRC 2538 is returned when
   using a recent JRE which has SSLv3 disabled.
   
   Upon examining the stack of the exception this error message
   will be seen along with the MQRC 2538:
   
   Connection to host 'host1/1.2.3.4:1444' rejected.
   [1=java.lang.IllegalArgumentException[Only SSLv3 was enabled
   while com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3 is set to true],
   
   As well as standalone Java applications written to the CMPAPI
   this also applies to Message Broker Explorer (MBX) and Message
   Broker Toolkit connections when they are run using an updated
   JRE with SSLv3 disabled.

   this also applies to Message Broker Explorer (MBX) and Message
   Broker Toolkit connections when they are run using an updated
   JRE with SSLv3 disabled.
   
   The Message Broker Explorer and Message Broker Toolkit display a
   list of ciphers available for connection to the Queue Manager
   which does not include all ciphers available for connection.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now allows connections to a secured Queue Manager
   using a TLS cipher suite.
   The Toolkit and Explorer products now display an updated list of
   cipher suites which are available for each environment.
