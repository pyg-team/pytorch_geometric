APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is no iinfo in current BPM 75 infocenter mentioned the
   connection URL to Oracle RAC in a db source is different from
   single Oracle node, especially for the db configuration during
   creating Deployment Environment.
   
   Here are similar info for WAS, WPS & WLE.

   Here is the technote will be published, related to "Configure
   Oracle RAC connection for Deployment Environment"
   
   Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) is a "share-everything"
   database architecture that can provide high availability and
   load balancing.
   When you create a Deployment Enviroment (DE) on BPM 7.5
   connecting to Oracle RAC, the steps and data source connection
   configuration are different from the ones for Oracle single
   node.
   
   1) Delay "create table" during creating DE.
   2) While creating DE, use single Oracle node parameters for data
   source configuration.
   3) After DE creation, update the data source URL for the Oracle
   database with the required configuration parameters.
   The existing one:
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port:databasename
   
   For Oracle 11g R2 RAC,  change it to
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port/scan
   
   For former version, change it to
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=
   
   (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=rac-node1)(port=1521))
   
   (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=rac-node2)(port=1521)))
                     (FAILOVER=on)(LOAD_BALANCE=on)
                     (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)
                     (SERVICE_NAME=<service_name>)))
   
   Be aware of these configuration options:
   If you are not using Oracle services, then service_name will be
   the database name in the example. If you are using Oracle
   services, then service_name will be the name of the services.
   The example has FAILOVER and LOAD_BALANCE turned on. To turn one
   or both of these features off, change on to off in the above
   example.
   4) Test data source connection to verify the configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Current BPM 7.5.x information center is missing steps for
   configuring Business Process Manager with Oracle RAC.
   Incorporate the specific steps  in infocenter to successfully
   configure Oracle RAC with BPM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Doc APAR created in RTC. Doc Team working on updating
   information center with missing information.
