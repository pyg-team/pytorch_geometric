APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reopening a collection log will set the
   SCOPETARGET.INUSEINCOLLECTIONPLAN flag to 'Y', but completing
   the log does not reset the flag to 'N'.  This prevents the
   custodian from ever being releasable/removable.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Add custodian to a Request.
   2. Click on "Collections", then click on "Logs".
   3. Click on "Log Entry".  Enter the required information,
   associate the log to the custodian, and then "Save and Close".
   4. Check the SCOPETARGET.INUSEINCOLLECTIONPLAN flag for this
   custodian.  Note that it is 'N'.
   5. Click on the log entry to view it again.
   6. Click on the "Reopen" button.
   7. Check the SCOPETARGET.INUSEINCOLLECTIONPLAN flag for this
   custodian.  Note that it is now 'Y'.
   8. Complete the re-opened log entry.
   9. Check the SCOPETARGET.INUSEINCOLLECTIONPLAN flag for this
   custodian.  Note that it is still 'Y'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The only workaround is to directly update the database and
   revert the SCOPETARGET.INUSEINCOLLECTIONPLAN flag to 'N'.
