PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to start IBM Rational Software Architect or IBM Rational Software Modeler version 7.5.4 or higher where the Modeling for Communications Applications floating license are enabled through IBM Installation Manager where the license key is installed on the Rational License server results in the error "Modeling for Communications Applications license key cannot be found". 

SYMPTOM
The following error appears each time you start IBM Rational Software Architect or IBM Rational Software Modeler version 7.5.4 or higher: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&amp;aid=1]

If you click on the "Manage licenses" button, you will see that there is no license key available on the server for the Modeling for Communication Applications.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=2]


although the License key administrator (on Windows) shows that the following licenses are available:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&amp;aid=3]



CAUSE
The IBM Rational Modeling for Communications Applications feature of IBM Rational Software Architect has changed name. 


Since version 8.0, it is now called: IBM Rational Software Architect Extension for Communications Application.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The licenses key for IBM Rational Software Architect Extension for Communications Application version 8.0 and IBM Rational Modeling for Communications Applications version 7.5.4 are not compatible with each other. 

In order to avoid the above the error "The Modeling for Communications Applications License key cannot be found" or resolve it, make sure that when you request/use the correct floating license key. 

In the Rational License Key Center, you may see the licenses under separate node/entry as shown below: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&amp;aid=4] 

If you select the first entry for IBM Rational Modeling for Communications Applications, here is how it may appears: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=5] 

You need to choose the IBM Rational Modeling for Communications Applications Floating License Key. 


The generated key will look like the following: 


INCREMENT ibmbluetel ibmratl 7.54000 permanent 2 DUP_GROUP=UH \
vendor_info="0|IBM Rational Modeling for Communications \
Applications Floating License Key|0" ISSUED=08-sep-2010 \
NOTICE="Sales Order Number: XXXXX \ 
....
If you select the second entry for IBM Rational Software Architect, here is how it may appears: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21446208&aid=6] 

 

As you can see, the list is more important, you need to choose the IBM Rational Software Architect Extension for Communications Application Single Install Floating License Key


The generated key will look like the following: 


INCREMENT ibmca ibmratl 8.00000 permanent 2 vendor_info="0|IBM \
Rational Software Architect Extension for Communications \
Application Single Install Floating License key|0" \
ISSUED=26-aug-2010 NOTICE="Eval Order Number:XXXX \
.....
The license server log (by default lmgrd.log) will have the following information 

 * ibmbluetel for IBM Rational Modeling for Communications Applications Floating License Key 
 * ibmca for IBM Rational Software Architect Extension for Communications Application Single Install Floating License Key 
 * Will appear in the log exactly as:
