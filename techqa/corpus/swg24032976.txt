ABSTRACT
 The IBM supplied ICU4J library incorrectly processes hyphens for dates when using the Arabic Egypt locale. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
PM65886 resolves the following problem:

ERROR DESCRIPTION: 
Hyphens are incorrectly interpreted as negative characters when processing dates when using the Arabic Egypt locale. 

LOCAL FIX: 

PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
All users of IBM WebSphere Application Server V7.0 with the Arabic Egypt locale enabled.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The IBM supplied ICU4J library incorrectly processes hyphens for dates when using the Arabic Egypt
locale.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

ICU4J (shipped as com.ibm.icu.jar) incorrectly recognizes hyphens in a date string as negative value indicators. This issue occurs when the ICU4J library is running within a system using the Arabic Egypt locale. Consider the following date: 2012-01-30-17.47.33 . The year 2012 is recognized as '-2012'. A
java.text.ParseException is thrown by the library, but is usually caught and not directly shown to the user. The WebSphere Application Server v7.0 includes ICU4J v3.4.5. This problem has been fixed in ICU4J v3.6.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 
ICU4J code was updated to properly handle the hyphens as separators between elements of the date string. 

The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix pack 7.0.0.25. Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for delivery information:
