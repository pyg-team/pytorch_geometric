Hardware Requirements Group Notes System z  Language Environment support provided by z/OS:

 *  C/C++
 *  DFSMS / DFP
 *  High Level Assembler
 *  ICSS
 *  ISPF
 *  JES
 *  Security Server
 *  SMP/E
 *  TCP/IP
 *  TSO/E
 *  VTAM (only TCP/IP supported with the JMS Client and WebSphere MQ Java Classes)

 WebSphere MQ for z/OS V7.1 runs on any IBM System z server that supports z/OS V1.11 with enough storage to meet the combined requirements of the programming prerequisites, WebSphere MQ for z/OS, the access methods, and the application programs.

 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support requires:

 *  z/OS Cryptographic Services Security Level 3 (FMID JCPT3B1)

 Shared Queue support requires:

 *  DB2 at the minimum level specified below
 *  Coupling Facility (CF) Level 9
 *  Resource Recovery Services (RRS) activated

 Virtualization 

 Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments.

 WebSphere MQ support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself.

Optional Supported Software Group Product Notes Application Servers 


Where a WebSphere MQ client application is running in one of the listed transaction manager environments, it is recommended that you contact the transaction manager vendor in the first instance for support.

For more detailed information about using WebSphere MQ with application servers see the WebSphere MQ resource adapter statement of support document [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023129].

The use of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets and message-driven beans is fully supported. The WebSphere MQ base classes for Java are supported with restrictions - for more details see Using WebSphere MQ Java Interfaces in J2EE/JEE Environments [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&dc=DB520&uid=swg21266535&loc=en_US&cs=UTF-8&lang=en&rss=ct171websphere] WebSphere Application Server for z/OS 6.1 and future releases, mod levels and fix packs (overview) [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/zos_os390/] (support) [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Application_Server]  See this document [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307203&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more information.
