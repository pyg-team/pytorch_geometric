   Maximo Asset Configuration Management 7.1.1.2
   Maximo Calibration 7.1.1.0

   Concerns/Problem:

   getting the below error:
   java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions
   in a list is 1000
   
   Steps to reprodiuce the issue:

   From the log file, find the below error message:
   10 Dec 2013 15:02:30:642 [ERROR] ORA-01795: maximum number of
   expressions in a list is 1000

   psdi.plusa.app.maintforecast.PlusAMaintenanceForecast.forecastBy
   Asset(Unknown Source)
   
   It seems this error maybe thrown because the sql that is used in
   the code is utilizing a sql function (IN clause) that has a
   built in limit of 1000.  This myabe causing that
   particular sql to fail.
