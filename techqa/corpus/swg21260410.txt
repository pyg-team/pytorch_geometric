PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 For large applications or any applications that cause the version 6.x Test Environment to take longer than 5 minutes for startup, this results in the server startup to time out, and Console output to no longer be updated.
In the background the server has started, but IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD) cannot communicate with the server. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to extend the server start timeout value to be a 

larger value for large applications or applications that require a long startup time. 

For example, in pre-processing for an application that can take a lengthy period of time, the server tools will time-out eventually. This is handled by a value
specified in the workspace metadata file: 

<your workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings\
com.ibm.wtp.server.core.prefs 

In this file there is an attribute specified as: 

start-timeout=210000 
(this is in milliseconds) 

The value is read and extended to make it a total of 5 minutes. 

However the extended value is hardcoded in RAD code. Therefore, the only
way to extend this time would be to modify the value in this file when 
RAD is not running. 

So for example, change the start timeout to about 
start-timeout=400000 

(For your specific application, it might take longer.) 

After you reset the value, the server should be able retain all your 
console output and get to a started state without timing out.
