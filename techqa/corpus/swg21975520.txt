PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel (CAFE), the IBM Cognos tab suddenly vanished and could no longer be seen. 

CAUSE
It is likely that the IBM Cognos tab was being used at the time when Excel stopped functioning for some reason or other. Excel automatically assumes that the current add-in was to blame and disables that add-in, thereby removing the IBM Cognos add-in.

ENVIRONMENT
MS Windows Server 7 Professional
MS Office Professional Plus 2007

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In Excel, resize window to maximum
> Go to File - Options
In Excel Options, click Add-Ins, and resize window to maximum

In Disabled Items, check if the “Addin: ibm cognos office for excel 2007/2010 (cognosofficeshim12.dll)” is in the list of disabled add-ins

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
