Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM Rational RequisitePro (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Rational RequisitePro. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational RequisitePro versions:



Version Status 7.1.4.x (all versions) Affected 7.1.3.x (all versions) Affected 7.1.2.x (all versions) Affected 7.1.1.x (all versions) Affected 7.1.0.x (all versions) Affected 
You are vulnerable if your use of Rational RequisitePro includes any of these configurations: 
 1. RequisiteWeb is configured to use SSL connections. 
 2. You use SSL connections in perl scripts run by ratlperl or cqperl. 
 3. You integrate with ClearQuest to use SSL. 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply the latest RequisitePro fix pack before applying the rest of the fix:


Affected version Applying the fix 7.1.4.x (all versions) Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 7 (7.1.4.7) for 7.1.4 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039494] 7.1.3.x (all versions) Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 14 (7.1.3.14) for 7.1.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039495] 7.1.2.x (all versions) 
7.1.1.x (all versions) 
7.1.0.x (all versions) Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 17 (7.1.2.17) for 7.1.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039496] RequisiteWeb: 

The solution is to apply fixes or mitigations to your IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) and IBM HTTP Server (IHS) components. 

If your clients connect to IHS via SSL (which then redirects their connections to WAS), then review this IHS bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701072] and apply fixes or remediations to your server. 

If your clients connect directly to WAS with SSL, then review this bulletin for instructions on applying a mitigation or fix to your WAS installation and your RequisiteWeb profile:
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503]. 

Depending on your version of RequisitePro, you may need additional steps when installing IHS or WAS fixes:



Affected version Applying the fix 7.1.4.x (all versions), 7.1.3.x (all versions) Apply the appropriate WebSphere Application Server and/or IBM HTTP Server fix directly to your RequisiteWeb server. 7.1.2.x (all versions), 7.1.1.x (all versions), 7.1.0.x (all versions) Document 1390803 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803] explains how to update WebSphere Application Server and/or IBM HTTP Server for RequisiteWeb Servers on these versions. Custom perl scripts run by ratlperl or cqperl:

The solution is to update to the latest supported fix pack, then check your scripts for any uses of SSL. 

Disable any uses of the insecure RC4 cipher when you use IO::Socket::SSL. The SSL_cipher_list setting configures permissible ciphers for use by OpenSSL . You can view the documentation with: 
ratlperl -e "use Pod::Perldoc; Pod::Perldoc->run();" IO::Socket::SSL  

ClearQuest integrations:

The solution is to update to the latest supported fix pack, then restore the default configuration with SSLv3 disabled. See Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM Rational RequisitePro (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692313].

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

For unsupported versions, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.
