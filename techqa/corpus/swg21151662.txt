Title: IBM Creating non-UCM VOBs with ClearCase LT - United States

Text:
CCLT; base ClearCase; lt; base; vob; nonucm; 1151662 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why a VOB is only created as a UCM component, and how to create a base ClearCase速 VOB when using IBM速 Rational速 ClearCase LT速 (CCLT). 

CAUSE
By default the ClearCase LT is designed to use UCM, thus the GUIs that help administer CCLT are designed to this end as well. 

Using the VOB Creation Wizard only creates new VOBs with an AdminVOB Hyperlink to the Project VOB (which is created when CCLT is first installed). A describe of a VOB that was created from the wizard will display the Hyperlink related to the projects VOB (PVOB).

 * Hyperlinks:
   AdminVOB@49@\Wizard_vob -> vob:\projects

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To create a VOB that is not a UCM component, you must use the command line, as this feature is not available from the GUI; since the GUI functionality is designed to create UCM components only. 

1. Open a Command Prompt (Start > Run and type: cmd) 

2. Use the cleartool mkvob command to create the VOB. 

Note: Refer to IBM Rational ClearCase Command Reference on the topic of mkvob ( or run cleartool man mkvob) for more information. 

 

Example: 

 * 
 * C:\>
 * cleartool mkvob -tag \cc_new_base -stgloc VOBs
 * 
 * Comments for "E:\ClearCaseStorage\VOBs\cc_new_base.vbs":
   This is base clearcase vob
   Created versioned object base.
   Host-local path: host1:E:\ClearCaseStorage\VOBs\cc_new_base.vbs
   VOB ownership:
   owner RATIONAL\jdoe
   group RATIONAL\Domain Users
   
   VOBs have special data backup considerations. For more information on how to
   back up your VOB properly, see the documentation for administering ClearCase.
   If the backups aren't done properly, you are putting your data at risk!
