Title: IBM Security Bulletin:The GPFS pattern provided with IBM PureApplication System is affected by security vulnerabilities. (CVE-2015-4974 and CVE-2015-4981) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been identified in the current levels of IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1, IBM GPFS V4.1 and V3.5:
- could allow a local non privileged attacker to execute commands with root privileges (CVE-2015-4974)
- could allow a local non privileged attacker to read system memory contents (CVE-2015-4981) 

IBM PureApplication System provides a GPFS pattern and addressed the applicable CVEs.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM PureApplication System V2.0 (GPFS Pattern type 1.2.0) using IBM GPFS V3.5.0.19
IBM PureApplication System V2.1 (GPFS Pattern type 1.2.1.0) using IBM GPFS V4.1.0.5
IBM PureApplication System V2.1.0.1 (GPFS Pattern type 1.2.2.0) using IBM GPFS V4.1.0.7
IBM PureApplication System V2.1.1 (GPFS Pattern type 1.2.3.0) using IBM GPFS V4.1.0.7

REMEDIATION/FIXES
GPFS server or client instances deployed with the affected GPFS Pattern versions are vulnerable. To determine whether deployed GPFS sever or client instances are affected by these GPFS security vulnerabilities, run the Get Cluster Status operation ( for a GPFS server instance ) or the GPFS Client Status operation ( for a GPFS client instance ) to verify the version reported for the GPFS nodes. The instance is affected if the GPFS version is V4.1.0.5, V4.1.0.7 or V3.5.0.19. 

The solution is to apply one of the following interim fixes or upgrade the PureApplication System to V2.1.2 or higher, and upgrade this instance using the pattern upgrade procedure. 

GPFS 3.5.0.28

GPFS 4.1.1.2
http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=2.1.1.0&platform=Linux&function=fixId&fixids=update-gpfs-4.1.1.2&includeRequisites=0&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=2.1.1.0&platform=Linux&function=fixId&fixids=update-gpfs-4.1.1.2&includeRequisites=0&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http]

The GPFS Pattern type 1.2.4.0 that is delivered with IBM PureApplication System V2.1.2.0 installs GPFS 4.1.1.2. Any instances deployed with this GPFS pattern type version or upgraded to this version will not be affected by these CVEs.

Whenever possible, the PureApplication System upgrade option is recommended instead of the interim fixes.
