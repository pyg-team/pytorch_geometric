SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects the IBM Rational Connector for SAP Solution Manager. You should configure the product to eliminate these weak ciphers. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
Description: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational SAP Connector 4.0.0.x (4.0.0.1, 4.0.0.2, 4.0.0.3, 4.0.0.4, 4.0.0.5, 4.0.0.6, 4.0.0.7)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Upgrade to Rational SAP Connector 4.0.0.8 [https://jazz.net/downloads/sap-connector/releases/4.0.0.8].

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If your product is deployed on IBM WebSphereÂ® Application Server (WAS), you should apply the WAS remediation/mitigation according to the bulletin published by WAS. Please monitor the IBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt] for WAS bulletins.

To disable vulnerable ciphers on Tomcat: 

 1. Open the server.xml file located in Tomcat conf directory 
 2. Locate the <Connector port="9443" section 
 3. Modify the <Connector> element, ciphers property to use this list: 

 * 


Note: To be able to use the 256 bit AES Ciphers, it is necessary to install the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files, which can be found here [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the weak ciphers will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the weak ciphers and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
