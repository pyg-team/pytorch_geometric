APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We recently updated our OMNIbus installation on AIX 7.1 from
   8.1.0.12
   to 8.1.0.13.  As our process agents do use PAM for
   authentication, we
   were hit by an issue related to APAR IV97985 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV97985].
   
   Now that OMNIbus wants to reset the login counter, PAM
   configuration
   does require that the service has access to the account module.
   In the
   Knowledge Center
   (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.
   1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0
   /omnibus/wip/install/task/omn_con_sec_configuringmetomext.html),
   it is
   documented to give access to the account module to the object
   server
   and the gateways, but not the process agent (only auth is
   listed).
   
   Without account, at version 8.1.0.13, it is no longer possible
   to login
   to the process agent using PAM.  So the documentation should be
   updated
   to mention that the process agent also needs to have the account
   module
   setup.
   
   I believe the README file for the FP13 should be changed as well
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  setup the account module for the process agent
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Administrators who are administering user access security.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When configuring Netcool/OMNIbus to use PAM for external     *
   * authentication, you must add another module type of          *
   * 'account' to the 'netcool' service.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Netcool/OMNIbus v8.1.0.16 and related             *
   * documentation, after v8.1.0.16 becomes generally available.  *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After v8.1.0.16 becomes generally available, upgrade to
   Netcool/OMNIbus v8.1.0.16 and related documentation,  i.e. the
   updated documentation topic will be here:
