APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   In IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC), the 'Save and Close' and
   'Save' buttons in the inline editor stay disabled even after a
   user edits/updates a value of an integer type attribute.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. In a Scrum project, create a new integer type attribute on
   Defect type
   2. Add the attribute to the Inline editor of the Defect type
   (Default). Set presentation kind to Integer.
   3. Create a new defect on the project
   4. Run a work item query that includes the created defect in the
   result set
   5. In the query result page, click to edit the defect. The
   inline editor will open.
   6. Enter a value for the custom integer attribute created in
   step 2. Do not click elsewhere.
   
   Actual Output:
   The 'Save and Close' and 'Save' buttons stay disabled. However,
   if you move cursor to set focus somewhere else, the buttons will
   be enabled.
   
   Expected Output:
   The 'Save and Close' and 'Save' buttons are enabled
   
   Also note the different behaviors below between 2 browsers
   (Firefox versus IE):
   In Mozilla Firefox, the save button is not enabled, clicking on
   it does not save the work item.
   In Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), the save button is not
   enabled, but clicking on it saves the work item.

LOCAL FIX
 *  After entering a value for the integer-type attribute, move the

   enabled.
