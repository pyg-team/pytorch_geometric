APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Editing a Decision Table with ODM 8.5.1 Enterprise Console (
   http://.../teamserver) using Firefox 31 freeze the browser.
   It is then necessary to close the browser window and login
   again to the Enterprise Console.
   The same problem applies to:
   - Firefox 34,35 or 36 (browser versions on which it was also
   observed)
   - ODM 8.5.1 fixpack 1 & 2
   Using Firebug the below error messages can be seen:
   - ReferenceError: IlrDTWTextField is not defined
   - ReferenceError: IlrWComboBox is not defined
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either use:
   - The Business Console (http://.../decisioncenter)
   - ODM 8.5.1 supported version of Internet Explorer or Chrome
   with both Enterprise and Business Console.
   - Firefox 17, the lowest supported version of firefox, can also
   be used as an alternative browser.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The web component used in decision center are becoming
   incompatible with newer version of Browser
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With 8.7 we support officially FF ESR24 and with 8.6 and
   earlier version ESR 17.  We are making every effort to support
   newer version of Browser and we will improve this behavior in
   future updates and release to stay current with Browser support.
