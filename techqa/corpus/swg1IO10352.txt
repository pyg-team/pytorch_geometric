ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Performing a Search using the Content Search tab, the Case
   Insensitive option does not work.
   
   If you perform a search for the word Cyan and check the Case
   Insensitive option. Items that contain cyan and Cyan will be
   returned.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Searches from the Content search tab were not case sensitive
   
   Content searches were not case sensitive by default, as they
   should have been. For example, even if you did not select the
   Case insensitive search option and you searched for Cyan, DB2
   Document Manager returned both cyan and Cyan. With the fix of
   this APAR, content searches are case sensitive by default,
   unless you select the Case insensitive search option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in DB2 Document Manager v8.3 Fix Pack 12.
