APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After opening a toolkit in IBM Integration Designer, validation
   errors CWSCA8019E, and CWSCA8025E are present in IID. This is
   due to the interface for the AIS not being generated in the IID
   project. The interface is not generated because internal
   metadata indicating where to generate the interface is missing.
   It is unknown as to why the metadata is missing as there is no
   way for a user to modify it.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A work around is available:
   Disassociate all projects associated with the toolkit from the
   process center, then delete it and its contents from the
   workspace, then then re-open the toolkit again in IID. Then need
    to touch each AIS in process designer to regenerate the
   interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The interface for the advanced integration service is not
   present in the IBM Integration Designer project.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a 'Refresh and Publish' action in IID is performed, the
   projects will be checked to see if they are missing any
   metadata, and if so the metadata will be repaired. This is fixed
    in an iFix for 8.0.1.1, and all follow on releases.
