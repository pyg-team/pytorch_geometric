APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When different releases of CICS are installed in CICS regions
   that are connected and the regions have been defined to both
   CIUCNTL files then  CICS storage violations can occur.
   DFHSM0102  IYDZZ518 A storage violation (code X'030B')
   has been detected by module DFHSMGF.
   (Module:DFHMEME) CICS symptom string for message DFHSM0102 is
   PIDS/5655Y0400 LVLS/680 MS/DFHSM0102 RIDS/DFHSMGF PTFS/UI17288

   *                      CICS IA releases can lead to storage    *

   ****************************************************************
   When CICS IA is installed in more than one connected region at
   different releases of CICS IA then this can lead to storage
   overlays and abends. The CICS regions will be using different
   CIUCNTL files and the regions will be defined to both. In this
   case when using CINT in either of the regions IA will issue an
   API call to the other region to obtain its status
   (ACTIVE/INACTIVE). It does this using   the API program
   CIUA610C. In later releases of CICS IA the commarea for this API
   has increased. The invocation of this program with the incorrect
   commarea length can cause storage overlays and abends.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The API program CIUA610C has been updated to check that the
   commarea passed is from a supported version of CICS IA. If the
   commarea length does not match then we immediately return and
   set the status of the CICS region to UNINSTALLED.
