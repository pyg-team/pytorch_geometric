ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#act
   ion=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=18001 [https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=18001]
   Customer is somehow getting an incorrect Page Type in the
   Datacap Navigator job monitor. This Page Type is simply a
   misspelled version of one of the existing Page Types. As
   follows:
   -- Existing and correct Page Type:
   "Escritura Constitucion de la Empresa Pag N"
   
   -- Incorrect Page Type shown in the Dcap Nav Job Monitor:
   "Escritura Constitucionde la Empresa Pag N"
   
   
   This is strange for the following reasons:
   -- It's my understanding that the Page Types are gathered from
   the DCO. The incorrect Page Type indicated above, is not listed
   in the application's DCO? The only one that appears DCO via the
   applications self-titled DCO is "Escritura Constitucion de la
   Empresa Pag N"
   -- Looking at the Batch's PageID_rrs.log, PageID.xml, they only
   indicate the correct Page Type of "Escritura Constitucion de la
   Empresa Pag N".
   -- Per the customer's screenshots, this misspelled Page Type is
   listed in the drop-down of the Datacap Navigator's job monitor,
   which again is strange, as it is not in the DCO xml, so not sure
   how that is possible to begin with?
   
   At first I was thinking someone might be manually changing the
   Page Type from the drop down list, but this would not explain
   how it would be available to be selected, again, going back to
   it not being listed in the DCO.
