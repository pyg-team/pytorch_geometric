Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx: ISM HTTP monitor reports failed urls while using regexp - United States

Text:
regexp failure TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using ISM HTTP monitor, with several regular expressions being defined in the http monitor setting elements, several urls are reported as Failed for RegExpStatus. 

SYMPTOM
TEP ISM workspace reports FAILED regular expressions


CAUSE
Possible cause is that the regular expression definitions are incorrect

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for Transactions, Internet Service Monitor

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
on the ISM agent, edit the $ISMHOME/etc/props/http.props file, set/ uncomment in it :





MessageLevel : "debug"

OutputResult : 1

OutputDirectory : "$ISMHOME/var"

Save the modified file.

For reference:
- OutputResult:1 -> Specifies that the NCO monitor should save the data it receives from the service. 


- OutputDirectory :"$ISMHOME/var" -> Specifies the output directory to use if the OutputResult is saved. Default is : $ISMHOME/var. 


- MessageLevel : "debug" -> change the Message/ trace level of the "$ISMHOME/log/http.log file to 'debug', to obtain further tracing in http.log file.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restart the http nco monitor.

Verify that "$ISMHOME/var" or similar directory actually contains .html, .index, etc. pages of
the monitored application, that is targeted by the HTTP ISM monitor service, after the ISM monitor has polled the targeted resource/server.

Replicate the issue and review the entire "$ISMHOME/var" directory content. Check in this directory the page source of the monitored URLs, for example index.html file, to try and verify, if the regular expression settings, that are reported as 'FAILED' in http.log file are possibly caused by wrong regular expression definitions.
