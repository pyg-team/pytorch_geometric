LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem affects users of the IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern
   Type V8 who use multi-instance MQ patterns.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX, Linux on x86-64
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   An error in the MQ Virtual System Pattern Type maintenance
   scripts meant that a multi-instance MQ Pure queue manager did
   not failover the active instance to the standby instance during
   maintenance p-type / fixpack upgrade so the queue manager was
   incorrectly terminated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ Virtual System Pattern Type maintenance scripts have been
   amended to ensure that a Multi-instance MQ Pure queue manager
   fails over to standby before maintenance is applied.
