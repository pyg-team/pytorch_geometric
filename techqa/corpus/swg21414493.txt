Title: IBM Issues with the debugger in WebSphere Integration Developer V7.0 - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following issues occur when using the debugger in WebSphere Integration Developer V7.0:

Debugging snippet breakpoints: For breakpoints to work in Javaâ„¢ or visual snippets, or business rule sets, they must be set in the editor after an integration or mediation module has run at least once on the server. For example, if you set a breakpoint in a custom mediation or business process snippet, and the containing module has not been run since the server was last started, execution will not stop at the breakpoint. If this occurs, remove the breakpoint and add it back. 

Also, breakpoints in business process snippets will not work. The workaround for this problem is to set a breakpoint on the entry or exit of the snippet activity rather than in the Property details section.

Debugging business rule sets: When execution stops at a breakpoint in a business rule set, the Step Over function may not behave as expected. For example execution may step into internal Java code, rather than to the next rule. If this occurs, set a breakpoint in another rule and select the Resume function instead of Step Over. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These issues are limitations. See the Problem section above for proposed workarounds.
