Title: IBM Reason why restarts are needed during Mac patching with BigFix - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do the majority of the fixlets in the Patches for Mac and Updates for Mac Applications sites require the BigFix endpoint machine to be restarted after applying? 

CAUSE
Integrity and stability of the endpoint OS.

ANSWER
If the following line is present at the bottom of the fixlet's actionscript, action requires restart, the endpoint machine will be required to be restarted in order for the update to install. 

Most of the fixlets in the Patches for Mac and Updates for Mac Applications contain this line of actionscript and require the endpoint machine to be restarted after application of the update. 

There are two main reasons for this: 

 1. The vendor (Apple) does not provide a definitive yes or no as to whether a reboot is required, or not. As a preventative measure, BigFix requires the endpoints restart after the patch installation or update is completed. 
 2. And, at any particular time, BigFix cannot detect which process is currently working on the endpoint. These processes could lock a file that is required to be updated by the patch. This prevents the BigFix agent from determining when a reboot should or should not occur. Not rebooting before proceeding further into additional patching or usage could potentially corrupt the OS, application, or file system. While this risk is small, a decision has been made to require restarts in order for the updates to complete.
