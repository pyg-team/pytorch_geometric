APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Developer for z Systems - IDz - v14.0.0.5, When a COBOL
   program contains nested programs and copybooks then selecting
   the first nested program on the outline view shows the copybooks
   declaration on the COBOL editor instead of the
   "IDENTIFICATION DIVISION." of the first nested program.
   
   1- Edit a COBOL program
   2- On the outline view, double click on the first subprogram
   declaration (like"PROGRAM: SUBPRG1")
   3- Observe that COBOL editor content is moved and cursor is
   placed just after the copybook declaration instead of the
   subprogram declaration.
   4- comment out the copybook declaration and repeats steps 2:
   observe now that the cursor is correctly placed on the
   subprogram statement in the editor.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no known workaround at this time.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified the COBOL outline view to correctly calculate line
   offset for COPY statements and nested programs.
