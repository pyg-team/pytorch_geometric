APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A REORG jobs having a special character in the job name
   (i.e. x'@') , which is used to build the Utilid, fails due to
   checking the wrong generated mapping table name:
   SNU000I    061 07:39:58.55 DSNUGUTC - OUTPUT START FOR UTILITY,
   V592915.VDSYDR&#65525;1
   .
   DSNU056I  -DL3 061 07:39:59.72 DSNUGMAP - TABLE
   'V592915.REORG_MAPTABLE_V592915.VDSYDR@1_0002' NOT FOUND
   DSNU017I    061 07:40:01.83 DSNUGBAC - UTILITY DATA BASE SERVICE
   EXECUTION ABENDED, REASON=X'00C90101
   .
   The USUUID is used for building the mapping table name.
   When the character '@' (x'7C') is part of the UTILID (USUUID) it
   looks that Reorg goes searching for mapping table having
   the character ' ' (x'B5', 'at')
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use special characters in jobname or utility id UID
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 11 for z/OS users of REORG           *
   *                 TABLESPACE SHRLEVEL CHANGE utility.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ABEND04E RC00C90101 and MSGDSNU056I     *
   *                      occurred when a REORG TABLESPACE        *
   *                      SHRLEVEL CHANGE created a mapping table *
   *                      implicitly with special characters in   *
   *                      the utility identifier (UID).           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply corrective PTF when available.         *
   ****************************************************************
   A REORG TABLESPACE SHRLEVEL CHANGE running with a special
   character in the UID abended with ABEND04E RC00C90101 after
   issuing the message DSNU056I - TABLE 'tbname' NOT FOUND.
   It happened because of an internal conversion error when
   generating the mapping table and index name from the UID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  REORG code has been modified to correct this conversion error.
