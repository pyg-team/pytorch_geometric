QUESTION
 How can I stop my Tibco EMS object from continuing to send the following error messages every 5 minutes even after it's been deleted:



20130703T201712Z [tibco-ems][error] tibems-server(exampleTibEMS): tid(95): Failed to resolve host - testhost.example.com

20130703T201712Z [tibco-ems][error] tibems-server(exampleTibEMS): tid(95): Failed to resolve host - testhost.example.com

20130703T201712Z [mgmt][error] tibems-server(exampleTibEMS): tid(95): Operation state transition to up failed


CAUSE
Tibco EMS objects in the down - Pending state may continue to attempt to bring the object up even after it has been deleted in firmware versions which do not contain APAR IC85076.

ANSWER
This issue can be resolved by installing a fixpack which contains APAR IC85076

After installing the fixpack containing the APAR, the Tibco EMS object will stop trying to bring itself up within 5 minutes and you will not see error messages listed in the question section.

Alternatively, Identical Event Detection can be configured in a log target to suppress identical events from the same object over a defined suppression period. Identical Event Detection can be configured for a log target in the Web GUI (Status>Main>Logging Targets) or from the CLI using the command event-detection in log target mode.
