APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a WPS 5 environment there are missing transactions in the
   MS-WebUI reports. Also the throughtput and response time are
   zero most of the time.
   
   The reason is that JSF instrumentation conflicts with Portal
   instrumentation, despite FP4 is already installed.
   
   The FP4 should automatically disable the JSF instrumentation:
   this actually works for WPS 6.x env only. We need to make sure
   JSF instr. is disabled on WPS 5 also.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To disable JSF instrumentation, add the following property to
   the toolkit_custom.properties file:
   
   com.ibm.tivoli.itcam.dc.jsf.enablejsf=false
   
   and then restart the portal server.
