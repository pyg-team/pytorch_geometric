PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a DB2 database is used for the Standardization Rules Designer repository, you might receive a logging error when you import or delete a large sample data file. 

SYMPTOM
When you perform Standardization Rules Designer operations that involve large sample data files, you might receive the following error: 

Logging operation failed.


CAUSE
The amount of transaction log space that is available to the DB2 database for the Standardization Rules Designer repository might not be sufficient to contain the volume of log entries that are produced when large sample data files are processed.


ENVIRONMENT
This problem is limited to DB2 databases.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If a DB2 database logging error occurs when you import or delete a large sample data file, you can resolve the problem by completing the following steps: 

 1. If you want to import sample data, you might be able to resolve the problem by reducing the number of fields or records in the sample data file. 
 2. Otherwise, ask your IBM InfoSphere Information Server administrator to increase the transaction log space for the Standardization Rules Designer repository.


Also note that Microsoft Internet Explorer has an automatic timeout limit of 60 minutes. Therefore, even if you resolve the database logging error, you might still encounter a session timeout if you use Internet Explorer as your browser. If the session times out, and you want to use Internet Explorer, implement the workaround that is described in the Microsoft support topic http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181050 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181050]. If you do not need to use Internet Explorer, you can open the Standardization Rules Designer in Mozilla Firefox.
