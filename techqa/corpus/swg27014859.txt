 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 This technote describes how to migrate from the embedded JDBC driver on WebSphere® Application Server Version 6.1 to the Microsoft® JDBC driver on WebSphere Application Server Version 7 

CONTENT
If your database is on SQL Server 2005, and you are migrating WebSphere Application Server from V6.1 to V7 while you upgrade Records Manager to V8.5, you must use the Microsoft JDBC driver to connect to the SQL Server database instead of using the embedded JDBC Driver. Perform the following steps: 

 1. Start the Records Manager EngineConfig tool. Use the tool to delete the existing data source that is created to connect to the Records Manager database on the SQL Server by using the embedded JDBC driver on WebSphere Application Server V6.1. 
 2. Follow the instructions in the linked technote in the Related information section to create a new data source by using the Microsoft JDBC driver.
