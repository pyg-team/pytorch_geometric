PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You find that the RTAACTV view displays a status of PENDING for a RTADEF associated with a PERIODEF even though the timezone and local time are current. The RTADEF status changes to ACTIVE exactly one hour later. 

CAUSE
Some locations around the world modify their time offset from GMT twice a year. Usually, the first change occurs in March or April, when local standard time (LST) is moved ahead by one hour, creating local daylight savings time (LDST). For locations in time zones Z through M, LDST is one hour farther ahead of GMT. For locations in time zones N through Y, LDST is one hour closer to GMT. In October or November, locations that use LDST usually change back to LST. Time in these locations then reverts to the standard difference from GMT.

For operation of CICSPlex SM, sites in locations that make use of LDST must modify the appropriate CICSPlex SM definition twice a year. This means indicating YES to daylight savings when LDST is in effect, and NO when LST is in effect. When the daylight savings indicator is NO, CICSPlex SM considers an entity in that time zone to be the normal number of hours from GMT. When the daylight savings indicator is YES, CICSPlex SM considers that entity to be one hour further ahead of GMT (than during standard time) for time zones Z through M, and one hour closer to GMT for time zones N through Y.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the PERIODEF uses timezone ' A ' , check the daylight savings time for Y or N in the CMASD view and the CICSSYS view for the region to ensure it is accurate.

If the PERIODEF uses a timezone other than 'A' , the daylight savings time indicator has no affect whatsoever. The standard time is used. For example, if the PERIODEF specifies timezone 'U' for EST and a start time of 08:00 and daylight savings time is in effect, and the PERIODEF is associated with a RTADEF, and the CLOCKxx member does not specify a timezone offset from GMT, then the RTADEF will not actually start until 09:00 as EST is used, not EDT.

Note: 

After changing the system time to adjust for LDST, you need to use the PERFORM RESETTIME [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.systemprogramming.doc/commands/dfha8_performresettime.html] command in the CMAS. However, if the CMAS was started using the CICS system initialization table (SIT) parameter AUTORESETTIME=YES, the PERFORM RESETTIME is not required.
