   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The documentation does not              *
   *                      sufficiently explain how to configure   *
   *                      and manage entity beans.                *

   ****************************************************************
   The configuration of the entity beans involves the use of an
   assembly tool. Therefore, a link will be added to the assembly
   tool documentation. Also, the cache settings, such as Activate
   at and Load at, will be defined more clearly in the
   Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Versions
   6.1 and 6.0.x.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Information Centers for WebSphere Application Server
   Versions 6.1 and 6.0.x will be updated to include more
   information about the configuration settings and links to the
   documentation for the assembly tools.
   
   The following information will be added to the "EJB Container
   tuning" topic:
   
   EJB stateful session bean tuning
   The stateful session bean timeout value is configured in an
   assembly tool. For WebSphere Application Server Version 5.1
   and later, the stateful session bean default timeout value is
   600 seconds. If this default value is not acceptable, you can
   change it in the tooling's EJB deployment descriptor editor.
   Stateless session beans do not have a timeout value because
   they have no conversational state and are not dedicated to any
   one client.
   You cannot set the timeout globally or on a server basis. You
   can only set the timeout on a bean-by-bean basis.
   The assembly tool information is available at the following
   URL:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtnlhelp/v6r0m0/index.j [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtnlhelp/v6r0m0/index.j]
   sp
   ------------------------------------------
   Specific information will be added to the information center
   about the Entity EJBs Activate at and Load at configuration
   settings, which specify how and when to load and cache data
   from the corresponding database row data of an enterprise bean.
   
   The following information will be added to the "EJB
   Containers" topic:
   
   The Activate at setting specifies the point at which an
   enterprise bean is activated and placed in the cache. Removal
   from the cache and passivation are also governed by this
   setting. Valid values are Once and Transaction. Once indicates
   that the bean is activated when it is first accessed in the
   server process, and passivated (and removed from the cache) at
   the discretion of the container, for example when the cache
   becomes full. Transaction indicates that the bean is activated
   at the start of a transaction and passivated (and removed from
   the cache) at the end of the transaction. The default value is
   Transaction.
   The Load at setting specifies when the bean loads its state
   from the database. The value of this property implies whether
   the container has exclusive or shared access to the database.
   Valid values are Activation and Transaction. Activation
   indicates the bean is loaded when it is activated and implies
   that the container has exclusive access to the database.
