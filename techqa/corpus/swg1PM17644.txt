APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The stop button is in between the Run and Build buttons.
   Sometimes I can't even click on the button at all because
   Rhapsody just freezes up while it's building (notice the 'Not
   Responding' in title bar and the menu bar whited out... then
   once the build process is done all the output comes out, instead
   of showing me line by line what it's compiling.
   
   I think it may have something to do with building with
   dependencies. Right now as I'm developing some tests and
   rebuilding quite often, I'm realizing I *can* press the Stop
   button. But in this case I'm only building the active component
   without building its dependencies (since they've already been
   built and I have not changed them). I wonder if in 7.5.2 the
   specific case of building with dependencies is also 'fixed' such
   that I am able to interrupt C.G.
   
   
   Another thing I would like for you to try is to stop the build
   while errors are being output. This is another case (that I just
   ran into) where I am unable to press the stop button.
