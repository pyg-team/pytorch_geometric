ABSTRACT
 In Business Process Manager Advanced Version 8.0.1, the default protocol used by Business Process Choreographer Explorer was changed to use HTTPS. You can switch it back to HTTP. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
When Business Process Choreographer Explorer uses the default secure HTTPS protocol, any attempts to access Business Process Choreographer Explorer using HTTP are redirected to use HTTPS. If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. 

Attention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.

Switching to HTTP

If you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: 

 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.
    
    
 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.
    
     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, delete the install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. 
     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the
       install_root\ProcessChoreographer\internal\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.
       
       
    
    
 3. Run the script to patch the bpcexplorer.ear file. In a network deployment environment, you must run the script on the deployment manager.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, enter the following command:
       install_root/ws_ant.sh -f unsecureExplorer.ant 
     * On Windows platforms, enter the following command:
       install_root\ws_ant.bat -f unsecureExplorer.ant
       Note: A backup copy of the original EAR file is created named bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear.
       
       
    
    
 4. Deploy the patched bpcexplorer.ear file by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For version 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. 
     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].
       
       
    
    

Remember: In the future, if you install an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updates the Business Process Choreographer Explorer, it will revert to using the default secure HTTPS protocol. If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. 



Switching back to HTTPS 

If you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, its location is 
       install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal 
     * On Windows platforms, its location is 
       install_root\ProcessChoreographer\internal
       
       
    
    
 2. In that directory, copy or rename the backup EAR file bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear to bpcexplorer.ear and overwrite any existing copy.
    
    
 3. Deploy the original HTTPS version by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For versions 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. 
     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].
