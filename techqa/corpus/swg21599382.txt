PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When IBM Case Manager is configured for SSO with Siteminder, if you log out from Case Manager Client application, the resulting login page does not show the IBM Case Manager logo. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, configure anonymous access to the png images by modifying the access-control.xml file available in the <network_drive>:\login\icm\images directory: 

1. Mount a network drive through Windows to https://server:port/mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/

2. After you connect to this location, navigate to the \login\icm\images\ directory.

3. Open access-control.xml file for editing as shown in the following example and save your changes:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <role name="USER" access-level="USER">
 * 
 * <member type="user" identifier="uniqueName">anonymous portal user</member>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

4. Restart WebSphere Application Server.
