Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In a DB2 HADR environment with several databases Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms(TSAMP) should be used for high availability. 

CAUSE
A scenario was planned with 4 HADR databases and one single ServiceIP address. It was asked if that will work

ANSWER
The normal procedure to make DB2 databases high available is to use db2haicu command. 

The interactive procedure allows to enter the required values. 

 

It is not recommended to have only one virtual IP address for a number of HA databases. 

Each database should have assigned a ServiceIP address. In case of takeover the ServiceIP is moved to the peer node and allows to continue without interruption. 

Assign an IP address for each database.
