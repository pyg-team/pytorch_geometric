PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installing IBM® Rational® Application Developer v7.0 (RAD) into an existing Eclipse 3.2.1 shell using the Sun® JRE will result in some of the features getting grayed out in the installation screen. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If Rational Application Developer v7.0 is installed to an existing Eclipse running with SUN JRE then there will be no: 

 *  WebSphere Application Server Test environment and associated tools. Portal tools J2EE Connectors (J2C) tools 


because the IBM JRE is not available as a stand alone installation. If the above components are required, RAD needs to be installed in the Eclipse shell that comes with the installation or an existing Eclipse shell that comes with any of the Rational Software Development Platform installations. 

This also applies to Rational Application Developer v7.5 and 8.0. For more detailed information regarding the JRE, consult this technote:
