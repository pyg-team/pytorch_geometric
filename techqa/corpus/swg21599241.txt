Title: IBM Executing a scenario suite with a Scenario Service Provider (SSP) over HTTPS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to configure the machines hosting the WebSphere Operational Decision Management modules with regard to HTTPS when executing scenario suites ?

How to avoid the exception below while requesting from Decision Center the execution of a scenario suite on Scenario Service Provider (SSP) over HTTPS ?

Exception caught while contacting RES ilog.rules.res.util.http.IlrConnectionException: IO error when contacting "/res/repositoryService"
....
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.g: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target


CAUSE
When the execution of a scenario suite is requested from a client such as Decision Center, an HTTP/HTTPS request is made to the SSP, which in turn makes HTTP/HTTPS requests to the Rule Execution Server (RES) management console (to deploy and then undeploy a ruleapp for the duration of the scenario suite run).

ANSWER
The server hosting the SSP must be considered a client to RES, and Solution A or Solution B from Deploying a ruleapp to Rule Execution Server (RES) over HTTPS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427447] must be implemented for the SSP to successfully deploy and undeploy ruleapps to the RES server over HTTPS. For example, if Solution A is chosen, the RES server certificate should be added to the SSP JVM's trust store.
