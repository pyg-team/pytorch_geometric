APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WSRP consumer in Portal versions 6.1 or newer does not
   correctly handle an InvalidCookieFault returned by a Portal 6.0
   producer: The consumer throws a portlet exception and the
   portlet will be unavailable.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Upgrade the WRSP Producer from 6.0 to 6.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The WSRP consumer in Portal versions 6.1 or newer does not
   correctly handle an InvalidCookieFault returned by a Portal 6.0
   producer: The consumer throws a portlet exception and the
   portlet will be unavailable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Portal WSRP consumer is changed to correctly handle
   InvalidCookieFault that is returned by a Portal 6.0 producer:
   The consumer will invoke initCookie and then retry the WSRP
   request.
