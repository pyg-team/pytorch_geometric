APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Omegamon XE agent is started and SET MQIMONITOR statement
   is specified, then problems can occur if there are other
   products that have changed the expected WebSphere MQ linkage
   type from PC to BALR.
   
   Problem symptoms may include:
   
   2009.280 22:00:50.06 KMQMQ107E  Error from MQ API request MQGET
   QMgr=APA2 CC=X'02' Reason=X'0893'
   
   19.10.21 STC25138 +CSQX037E LTW1 CSQXSPRM Unable to get message
   from 523 SYSTEM.CHANNEL.INITQ, MQCC=2 MQRC=2195

   138 QMCPRH,M=CSQGFRCV,PSW=077C000080002100,ASID=0033
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   
   MQI hook cannot handle case when Resource Manager linkage type
   is changed from PC to BALR.   Changes will be made to handle
   both.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1)If running with ITCAM for Transactions, starting MQ agent and
   WebSphere MQ before ITCAM for Transactions may resolve and allow
   Omegamon XE for MQ Monitoring agent to run with MQI monitoring
   turned on.  However, there may be other applications that can
   cause this issue, so if this does not resolve issue, then MQI
   monitoring must be turned off until fix is available.
   
   2)Temporarily remove "SET MQIMONITOR ..."  and "SET APPL..."
   statements from hilev.RKANCMDU(KMQUSER) so that MQI monitoring
   is not installed/running.
