PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the RequisiteWeb and ClearQuest Web URLs entered into the IBM速 Rational速 ClearQuest速 and IBM Rational RequisitePro速 Integration Wizard are not saved when you enter then and exit the wizard. 

CAUSE
If there are no other changes made to the Integration mapping at this time, then the Web URLs will not get saved.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

You can use this procedure to manually add the Requisite Web and ClearQuest web URLs:


 1. Open up the RequisitePro .RQS in notepad.
    
    
 2. Add the following line in the [Project]section:
    CQWebURL=http://servername/cqweb/ 
    
    For example:
    
    [Project]
    Owner=adminstrator
    Name=GCSS
    GUID={51F2E024-83BD-11D6-879B-00065BDD8C28}
    CQWebURL=http://servername/cqweb/
    isTrackChangesAllowed=1
    Description=
    Owner Key=105
    Revision number=1.0147
    Prefix=GCSS
    NbrRequirements=3218
    Directory=\\sharenae\RAProjects\ReqPro\RequisitePro.rqs
    Key=1
    
    [Application]
    Data file version=1.0040
    Program Version=9.100.0.1
    
    
 3. In ClearQuest create a new Query based on record RAProject. Display the Name field with no filters.
    
    
 4. Find your RAProject name. Modify the record.
    
    
 5. On the RequisitePro tab add the following to the ReqWeb URL:
    
    http://servername/ReqWeb/
