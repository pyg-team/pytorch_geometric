CAUSE
The server was rebooted without first shutting down the queue manager. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is working as designed. 
You need to shut down your Queue Managers before rebooting the system to avoid these FDC reports.


Additional information
Usually there were many reports of this type of FDC from various WebSphere MQ processes and all these reports were created within a few seconds. The server was rebooted without shutting down the queue manager. Under these conditions it is expected, and desirable behavior to produce the FDCs.

Such FDCs are to record the fact that an MQ process (that is, the process that writes the FDC file) has received an asynchronous signal. These FDCs do not indicate a problem originating within MQ and they are "informational"; that is, they are not an indication of any MQ failure at all.
