QUESTION
 Q3 probes : How do the Q3 Probes work? 

CAUSE
The Q3 Probe portfolio requires the Solstice CMIP software to work and will only run on the Solaris SPARC platform.

ANSWER
The Q3 probes require the Solstice CMIP software to connect to the Element Manager and receive events. The Solstice CMIP software includes two daemons which must be running for the probe's connectivity to succeed. 

The Q3 Probe creates a link between the probe and source system, an event forwarder and then proceeds to read events from this event source. A command line interface is included to perform ad-hoc tasks such as resynchronisation. 

Please refer to the Support's Guide to Q3 probes for further detail and troubleshooting guidance. 

 

Note : The Q3 probes were withdrawn from download and Software Support in 2014.
