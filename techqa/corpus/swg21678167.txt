 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL that were reported on June 5, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0224 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, caused by the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted handshake to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt and modify traffic. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93586 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93586] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0221 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0221]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a recursion error in the DTLS client. By sending an invalid DTLS handshake, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93587 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93587] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0195]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending invalid DTLS packet fragments, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overrun the client or server and execute arbitrary code on a DTLS client or server.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93588 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93588] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0198 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0198]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the do_ssl3_write() function. If SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93000 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93000] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2010-5298 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-5298]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function. If SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an SSL connection in a multithreaded environment to inject data into an SSL stream and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92632 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92632] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3470 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3470]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the implementation of anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93589 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93589] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
