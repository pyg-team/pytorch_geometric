APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Setting the P8 Subject Cache Entry TTL to a value other than
   the default does not change the actual behavior of the Subject
   Cache. No matter what value the Subject Cache Entry TTL is
   set, subjects continue to age out of the cache at the default
   600 seconds.  Additionally, this setting should be output
   somewhere in either the application server log during startup,
   or the server trace so that it can be easily verified.
   This was noticed by development during investigation of defect
   787162.
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1.  Log into EM
   2.  Open the P8 domain properties - Server Cache tab
   3.  Set the Subject Cache Entry TTL to some non-default value
   4.  Select OK / exit EM
   5.  Reset the CE server
   Actual Results:
   Subjects are aged out of the cache at the default time.
   Expected Results:
   Subjects should age out of the cache at the set, non-default,
   time.
