Title: IBM "Failed to reload dynamic domains : No value was found for key 'foo'" in Rule Team Server - United States

Text:
BOM; dynamic; domain; reload TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Troubleshoot and fix the error "Failed to reload dynamic domains : No value was found for key 'foo'" when attempting the reload dynamic domains in Rule Team Server (RTS). 

CAUSE
The dynamic domain is not properly installed in RTS.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check that the reload of dynamic domains works correctly in Rule Studio (if the dynamic domain has been configured as a Rule Studio plugin). 

If the dynamic domain reload works properly in Rule Studio, that means that the implementation of the dynamic domains is correct, and the issue is with the packaging and configuration of the dynamic domains within RTS.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that RTS is correctly configured to use your implementation of IlrBOMDomainValueProvider [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/vocabulary/model/bom/IlrBOMDomainValueProvider.html] , as indicated in the documentation under WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Customizing > Customizing Rule Team Server > Customizing the Rule Team Server behavior > Integrating dynamic domains into Rule Team Server [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1621.html]. 

 

If you set the configuration parameter using the set-config-param ant task, you can check the name and value of the configuration parameter by navigating toInstallation Manager > Set configuration parameters in the RTS console 

 

 * The name of the parameter should correspond to the value of the domainValueProviderName property set on the BOM element. 
 * The value of the parameter should be the fully qualified name of your implementation of IlrBOMDomainValueProvider.


For example, if the domainValueProviderName property is set to foo on the BOM element: 

 * 
 * domainValueProviderName=foo


then the configuration parameter should be set as follows on RTS:  * 
 * teamserver.foo=myPackage.myBOMDomainValueProvider


where myPackage.myBOMDomainValueProvider is the fully qualified name of your IlrBOMDomainValueProvider implementation class.  

Alternatively, if you set this parameter as a preference, check that the name and value is correctly specified in the preferences.properties file packaged in the RTS EAR. 

If you do not specify the correct fully qualified name of your IlrBOMDomainValueProvider implementation class, the following error is seen: 

Failed to reload dynamic domains : Class 'wrongPackage.wrongBOMDomainValueProvider' was not found 

 * 


Note: You should set the parameter using only one method: as a configuration parameter using the ant task or as a preference in preferences.properties. Using both methods would complicate trouble-shooting and maintenance. RELATED INFORMATION
