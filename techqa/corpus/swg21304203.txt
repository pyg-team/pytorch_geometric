ANSWER
After:

* The user enters a URL to Maximo
* The JEE server is configured for JEE server security
* The requested resource is protected
* The JEE server requests security authentication
*The browser displays the authentication dialog
*The LDAP server authenticates the user
* The JEE Server checks user for membership in authorized group

What is the next step in the LDAP troubleshooting flow chart? 

 
Once the JEE server has confirmed user membership in an authorized group to access the application, the username is passed to Maximo. There is no code associated with this step. Once the JEE server is properly configured to use JEE server security, the server will automatically pass the username to Maximo once all of the prerequisite tests have been passed. Note, the username is passed case sensitive. If the user logs in with a different case or mixed case that is different than the LOGINID stored in the MAXUSER table, the login will fail with a Maximo error screen. 

 

Username is passed to Maximo:- WebLogic.wilson -----------> Maximo.wilson
