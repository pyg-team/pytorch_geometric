Title: IBM Unable to See Page/List Headers in Excel Format - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When publishing reports from IWR with headers, in PDF format the headers show, but not in Excel format. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The headers are free forms which the Excel file format cannot translate, hence you are unable to see them in the browser. If you were to save the file in Impromptu client as an Excel file you will get the same result.
