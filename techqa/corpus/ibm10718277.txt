ABSTRACT
Why are the Sampled situations not evaluating as soon as the managed system is added to managed system list? The Sampled situation is waiting for the next sampling interval to evaluate

CONTENT
This is working as designed. There are two evaluation timing loops. One is at the agent and that indeed will be evaluated as soon as the agent is made aware it should be evaluating it. The results of that evaluation are sent to the TEMS. The TEMS includes the dataserver [SQL processor] and that also periodically reviews current agent results and may cause situation events to be created. When a situation is already running, the TEMS dataserver evaluation is also running - based on the time the situation started. When an agent is added to a MSL [or if an agent comes online later] the agent results will have to wait until the next dataserver review, which will up to a sampling interval depending on exactly when the agent ran the evaluation.
