RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem 

When using System i Navigator, you may have difficulty changing or removing the defined Management Central server. 

Resolution

Microsoft Windows XP instructions:

The following steps will remove the defined Management Central server and remove the server from My Connections. Once the server is removed, it can be added again under My Connections: 

1. Verify System i Navigator is not opened. 2. From the Windows Start Menu, select Run. 3. Type regedit and press OK to open the Registry Editor. 4. To create a backup of your current Windows Registry, select File > Export. Name the backup and save it somewhere you will be able to locate if you need to restore your registry. Note: To restore the registry, run the .reg file that is created. 5. From the left panel, expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IBM\Client Access Express\CurrentVersion\Environments\ 6. Select My Connections. 7. Right click DefaultSystem and select Modify. Change the Value from <system_name> to either be blank or to another system to be used as your defined Management Central server. 8. Expand \My Connections and right click on <system_name> and select Delete. 9. Run System i Navigator and then the Management Central will be empty (or contain the <new_system_name> provided), and there will be no connection to <system_name> under My Connections. You may now add the system back to your My Connections.
