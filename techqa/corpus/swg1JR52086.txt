APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Saved search acceleration tools" topic in the IBM
   Business Process Management V8.0.1 knowledge center (
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTLXK_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.main.doc/topics/ctuningtools.html?cp=SSTLXK_8.0.1&lang=en)
   )  is incomplete and needs clarification.
   
   1.  The syntax for the SchemaGenerator tool does not indicate
   which profile the -profileName parameter refers to and does
   not indicate the three database parameters (db2, oracle, mssql).
   
   2.  The usage description for the DataLoad tool does not
   include this information:
   You must load the LSW_BPD_INSTANCE_VARS_PIVOT table with data
   from all BPD instances that are already in progress.
   The tool does not load data for closed instances.
   Loading the data allows search queries to use the pivot tables
   and find the data. When new instances are created the data
   will be automatically loaded into the pivot tables.
