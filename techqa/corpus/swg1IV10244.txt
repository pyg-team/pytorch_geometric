LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  During some queries WSRR builds an SQL statement that contains
   too many expressions in a single list for Oracle to handle. This
   results in the "ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a
   list is 1000" error message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to break up long expression lists into
   multiple lists when using Oracle.
