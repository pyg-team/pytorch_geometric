APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a message model if an element is defined as 'xsd:date' or
   'xsd:dateTime' type and the DateTime format does not contain the
   year part in it, then the MRM parser will fail to parse date
   February 29 (0229) with a BIP5540E error message.
   
   BIP5540E: Unable to parse value '0229' using format string
   'MMdd'. Strict Datetime Checking = 1.
   
   If the input dateTime field value misses any of the sub fields
   like year or month then the missing sub field value is
   substituted from the current epoch value which is 1970-01-01
   00:00:00. So date '0229' is treated as '02291970' which is not a
   valid date as 1970 is not a leap year and hence the MRM parser
   throws a BIP5540E error while parsing the date field value
   '0229' and its an expected behaviour of the product.
   
   This APAR provides an option under environment variable
   'MQSI_USE_CURRENTYEAR_FOR_SUBSTITUTION' to use current year as
   the substitution year if the input date value is missing the
   year part.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  clude the year in the DateTime Format and in the input Date
   value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V9.0 and V10.0 using the MRM
   parser with 'xsd:date' or 'xsd:dateTime' type elements.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In a message model if an element is defined as 'xsd:date' or
   'xsd:dateTime' type and the DateTime format does not contain the
   year part in it, then the MRM parser will fail to parse date
   February 29 (0229) with a BIP5540E error message.
   
   BIP5540E: Unable to parse value '0229' using format string
   'MMdd'. Strict Datetime Checking = 1.
   
   If the input dateTime field value misses any of the sub fields
   like year or month then the missing sub field value is
   substituted from the current epoch value which is 1970-01-01
   00:00:00. So date '0229' is treated as '02291970' which is not a
   valid date as 1970 is not a leap year. Hence the MRM parser
   throws a BIP5540E error while parsing the date field value
   '0229'. This is the expected behaviour of the product.
   
   This APAR provides an option to set a new environment variable
   'MQSI_USE_CURRENTYEAR_FOR_SUBSTITUTION'. When set, to any value,
   the product will use the current year as the substitution year
   if the input date value is missing the year part.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now provides an option under the environment
   variable 'MQSI_USE_CURRENTYEAR_FOR_SUBSTITUTION'  to use the
   current year as the substitution year.
