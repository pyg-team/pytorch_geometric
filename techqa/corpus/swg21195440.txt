 * Collecting data- selected tab,

Collecting data for problems with the IBM WebSphere Application Server, nodeagent, or dmgr process using Windows Services (WASService.exe) component. Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data.

To improve the accuracy of complete data collection, IBM recommends you use the automated data collectors within IBM Support Assistant. Not only will the automated collector gather the equivalent of the manual process, it will also provide a secure file transfer of the collection to IBM.

COLLECTING DATA USING THE IBM SUPPORT ASSISTANT DATA COLLECTOR
 1.  
 2.  WebSphere Application Server V8.0.0.6
 3.  
 4.  (ISADC)
 5.  
 6.  ISADC
 7.  
 8.  Using the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector.
 9.  
 10. 
 11. 
 12. Using the ISA Data Collector:  * To run ISADC from command line, go to your app_server_root/bin directory and run isadc.[sh|bat]
        
        
      *  To download, install and run ISADC locally:
        > Obtain the IBM Support Assistant Data collector online ISA Data Collector site for WebSphere Application Server. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/isa/isadc/?taxonomy=ApplicationServer] 
        
        >  >  Select the option to collect from this or another system using a downloadable utility. Download and extract the zip file to your WAS_HOME directory. From a command line, run isadc.[sh|bat] or launch index.html to use the web interface.
        
        
        
        
     
     
 13.  To download and run ISADC in your browser: 
     > Obtain the IBM Support Assistant Data collector online ISA Data Collector site for WebSphere Application Server. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/isa/isadc/?taxonomy=ApplicationServer] 
     
     >  Select the option to collect from this system using the current browser and click Start Collection.
     
     
     
 14. Select the Administration > WASService Problem (Windows Only) collector and click Start.
     
     
 15. Follow the prompts to automatically submit the collected data to IBM Support.

COLLECTING DATA MANUALLY
 
Note: WebSphere Application Server supports creating, starting and stopping of nodeagent and dmgr process using Windows Services (WASService.exe).

For more detailed information about templates usage, refer to the WebSphere Application Server V7.0 Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp]. 

 1. Was the Windows Service for the Application Server Javaâ„¢ Virtual Machine (JVM) process created during the Application Server installation or Profile creation process? If not, provide the command used to create the Windows Service.
    
    
 2. Is WebSphere Application Server global security turned on? What type of user registry is used?
    
    
 3. What error or symptoms do you observe?
    
    
 4. Can you start or stop the JVM process using a command line tool like startServer or stopServer? 
    
    
 5. Turn on tracing this can be done by either 1 of the 2 methods below:  * Download the WASServicecmd tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21397335] to assist you in creating the traces necessary and choose option 5 "Tracing WASServices".
       
       
     * Create a file in the C:\ (root C drive) called WASServiceTrace.enabled. Enter the word Trace (case-insensitive) in the file and save the file. Recreate the problem. There will now be a file in C:\ called WASServiceTrace.log. Look in this file and search for waitForPidFile: If found, note the location and name of the pid file. This will be needed for collection. 
       
       Note: WASService tracing for Windows was introduced in 6.1.0.17, 6.0.2.29 and 7.0.0.0. If you are running a lower level of code, obtain a copy of a newer version of WASService.exe. You can move a newer copy from another installation (must be same release level) or call IBM to obtain a newer copy.
       
       
    
    
 6. Provide a screen capture of the following registry key using regedit.  1. Run regedit.
        
        
     2. Capture the screen for two keys, one for each Windows Service. Make sure that Data values completely visible.  * First registry key:
           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
           CurrentControlSet\Services\
           IBMWAS6Service - <WAS6ProcessName>
           
         * Second registry key:
           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
           CurrentControlSet\Services\
           IBMWAS6Service - <WAS6ProcessName>\Parameters
           
        
        
    
    
 7. Collect the following files and diagnostic information:  * profile_root/logs/winservice_config.log 
     * profile_root/logs/*Service.log 
     * profile_root/logs/server/startServer.log 
     * profile_root/logs/server/stopServer.log 
     * profile_root/logs/server/trace.log 
     * profile_root/properties/soap.client.props 
     * c:/WASServiceTrace.log and the pid file 
     * Command used to create, start or stop the Windows Service entry 
     * Two screen captures for each Windows Service entry for Application Server processes 
     * Global Security information
    
    



What to do next 
Once you have collected the preceding information, you can submit the diagnostic information to IBM support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852].

EXCHANGING DATA WITH IBM SUPPORT
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR)
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
