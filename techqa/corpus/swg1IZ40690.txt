ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TDS 6.1 as Enterprise directory for TAM E-SSO IMS
   
   Customer configed TDS 6.1 as Enterprise directory for TAM E-SSO
   IMS
   by Configuration Utility.
   Then, customer found he can provision IMS administrator as an
   accout
   which is not existing in the LDAP server.
   
   After i read your e_mail,i have some questions need to ask you.
   And i
   also will refer the of my LDAP setting.
   I do the LDAP and TAM E-SSO setting is following the
   "IBM_TAM_E-SSO_AdministratorGuide_v8.0.0" and
   "IBM_TAM_E-SSO_DeploymentGuide_v8.0.0".
   I am not familiar with LDAP and if the following opinion is not
   right,hope you can point out.
   
   Questions:
   1),I'm not clear about the "fullname" attribute.Does the mean is
   the
   "ldap user-full-name-field" default value stand for? For
   example,"cn" in
   base on Unix/NISS LDAP server;"fullName" in Novell eDirectory
   LDAP;"displayName" in Microsoft directory.In the following "My
   user
   setting in my domain" ,i have try to set the different default
   value of
   "ldap user-full-name-field" to see whether i can get the right
   way to
   solve the problem.
   
   2),I am using Tivoli Identity Manager to provision user account
   and
   wallet data to Tivoli Access Manager E-SSO.Does it have special
   setting
   for the LDAP?
   Hopeful you can give some useful sources(such as "Lab guaid") to
   me
   about ITIM and TAM E-SSO integration.
   
   3),If the user that i want to add it into the role as
   administrator in
   IMS Config Utility is created by ITIM,how can i add "fullname"
   LDAP
   attribute?
   
   My LDAP setting:
   
   1),My domain setting
   dn: dc=tdstest
   dc: tdstest
   objectclass: top
   objectclass: domain
   
   2),My user setting in my domain
   dn: cn=linker,dc=tdstest
   uid: linker
   userpassword: tivoli
   objectclass: organizationalPerson
   objectclass: person
   objectclass: top
   objectclass: ePerson
   sn: linker
   cn: linker
   
   3),Basic configuration keys
   LDAP server URI: ldap://ldapserver-name:389
   Lookup user name: linker
   Lookup user password: tivoli
   Lookup user LDAP base DN: dc=tdstest
   LDAP User Tree DNs: dc=tdstest
   LDAP users DN attribute:cn
   LDAP lookup timeout: 3000
   
   4), Advanced configuration keys
   Enterpris account LDAP attribute: uid
   LDAP administrator user name: cn=root
   LDAP administrator user password: tivoli
   Other advanced confinguration keys setting as default value.
   
   As i describe in before mail,i can add anyone which not in my
   domain as
   administrator.Mybe that i have not understood the "fullname"
   attribute
   lead the problem.
   
   I use the the TDS for ITIM.ITIM and TDS in the same machine,and
   the IMS
   server is another machine.My ITIM and IMS use the same TDS
   instance,but
   there in different domain.
   The detail information is that:
   TDS instance name:ldapdb2
   ITIM domain: beta
   The domain For IMS: tdstest
   
   Customr Recreate: yes
   L2 Support Recreate: none
   
   Desired Behavior: able to configure TDS with IMS server properly
   Steps Duplicate:   not yet determined
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The wizard to provision IMS administrator will only check
   whether it is a valid account in the LDAP directory if the LDAP
   directory is AD. If you refer to the TAM E-SSO administrator
   guide, you will see the following text in the section on this
   wizard:
   Enter the user name and password of a valid Active Directory
   user.
   
   However, I do admit that the above does not directly indicate
   that the wizard will not be checking whether it is a valid
   account for non-AD LDAP directory. Please file a defect in
   Scarab so that we can track the following:
   1. Fix the documentation. For now, I think we should fix the
   documentation so that it is clearer as to what the wizard will
   do for non-AD ldap directory
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The wizard to provision IMS administrator will only check
   whether it is a valid account in the LDAP directory if the LDAP
   directory is AD. If you refer to the TAM E-SSO administrator
   guide, you will see the following text in the section on this
   wizard:
   Enter the user name and password of a valid Active Directory
   user.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The above does not directly indicate that the wizard will not be
   checking whether it is a valid account for non-AD LDAP directory
   The documentation will be updated to reflect this.
