PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are running CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) along with GT ASSIST/TS. The region abends with an 0C4 at startup. Soon after message "DFHSI1517 Control is being given to CICS", you receive DFHKE0201 KERNDUMP in DFHKESTX, DFHKE0202, BPXP018I THREAD xxx IN PROCESS 922, ENDED 496 WITHOUT BEING UNDUBBED WITH COMPLETION CODE 0033E000, IEF450I job CICS ABEND=S0C4 U0000 REASON=00000011. 

SYMPTOM
During CICS startup you receive:

DFHSI1517 Control is being given to CICS
DFHKE0201 ABOUT TO TAKE SDUMP. DUMPCODE: KERNDUMP, DUMPID: 0/0000. (MODULE DFHKESTX).
DFHKE0202 SDUMP COMPLETE. (MODULE DFHKESTX).
BPXP018I THREAD xxx IN PROCESS 922, ENDED 496 WITHOUT BEING UNDUBBED WITH COMPLETION CODE 0033E000
IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT
SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0C4 REASON CODE=00000011
IEF450I job CICS - ABEND=S0C4 U0000 REASON=00000011


CAUSE
Problem with global user exits supplied by GT ASSIST/TS

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You review the KERNDUMP and see there is an ABEND0C4 in module DFHKEDCL at offset x'274'. The failing instruction is a store multiple (STM). Register D, or R13, is zeros. The internal trace shows EXIT-PROGRAM GTAZCA64 AT EXIT POINT XZCATT was in control, and incorrectly branches into CICS module DFHKEDCL.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a known issue with ASSIST / TS 7.3.1. Contact [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21606825&amp;aid=1]GT Software [http://www.gtsoftware.com/] for PTF3123 that replaces the global user exit modules GTAZCA64 and GTAZCI64.
