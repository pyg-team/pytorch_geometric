QUESTION
 What is the procedure for deploying the RMIREG.WAR file to separate the RMI registry from any of the Maximo application server members 



CAUSE
Not documented in installation and deployment guides 

ANSWER
 

Note: for information on deploying the rmireg.war file for Maximo in WebSphere 6.0 or 6.1, see the link for Deploying the RMI Registry (rmireg.war) in WebSphere 6.0 or 6.1 for Windows below.

Building the RMI Registry WAR file 

The tool used to build the rmireg.war file is <maximo_home>/deployment/buildrmiregwar.cmd. This tool uses the settings in the 
<maximo_home>/applications/maximo/properties/maximo.properties file to build a war (Web Archive) file with the necessary parameters to run in the Maximo environment.

To generate the necessary war file, first modify the maximo.properties file (see Understanding the Maximo implementation of RMI [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3214&context=SSLKT6&q1=rmi&uid=swg21262022&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en]). When the properties file has been properly modified, execute the<maximo_home>/deployment/buildrmiregwar.cmd to build the <maximo_home>/deployment/default/rmireg.war file.

RMI Definitions

RMI stands for “Remote Method Invocation”. Java developers created this standardized system for using Java objects in a separate memory area from the one calling the remote object. Separate memory areas can reside on the same physical system or on different systems connected by a network.

RMI uses JRMP (Java Remote Method Protocol) to travel over networks to the remote server being called.

Any time there is more than one Maximo application deployed in a single environment or there is a vertically clustered environment for Maximo the rmireg.war file should be deployed. This will prevent the inadvertent loss of RMI communications if Maximo members are shut down or recycled.

The attached document explains how to deploy the rmireg.war file using IBM WebSphere 7.0, 8.0 and 8.5. 

------ 

1. Q. Do you set JVM memory parameters for the RMI Registry?
A. It is not necessary to set memory for the RMI Registry. 


2. Q. Can the same RMIRegistry Web Application Server be used for two different Maximo installations on the same Node?
A. The RMI Registry is connected to the default_host. This Virtual Host contains all ports used for applications servers on the WebSphere instance. Therefore, it is not necessary to create more than one RMIRegistry application server. 


3. Q. When deploying the Maximo application, should we map the rmiregistry to all four Maximo modules (along with webserver and application server)?
A. No, it is a stand-alone Web Application to be used by all Maximo instances on this WebSphere instance. 

 

4. Q. The screen shots are for WebSphere 7.0. Will this document work with WebSphere 8.0 and 8.5? 

A. Yes. The screen shots are WebSphere 7.0-specific, but the process of creating and deploying the rmireg.war in WAS 8.x and 8.5.x is identical. 

 

5. Q. Does this apply to Maximo 7.6? 

A. Yes, and it is deployed the same way. See Administering Maximo Asset Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLKT6_7.6.0/com.ibm.mam.doc_7.6.0/config/t_ctr_mam_configure.html] for discussion of deployment of the rmireg.war integrated with setting up a cluster with WebSphere.
