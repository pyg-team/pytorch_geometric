APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Default Rich Text Editor's button (insert rows, columns, remove)
   are not working. This issue is NOT with Ephox Editor.
   
   In the Authoring Portlet when we use the buttons "Insert Table"
   and "Modify Table" they work just fine.
   But the 6 buttons on the right of these ones are not working.
   These buttons should let you insert rows, columns,
   remove them, etc.
   
   This issue happens with all the browser. There are no JS error
   or any error in the browser.
