Title: IBM Domino Web SSO Users Complaining That They Are Logged Out While Active - United States

PROBLEM
As a Domino administrator you enable SSO for your iNotes users and set a session expiration of 120 minutes for the LTPA Token in the SSO document. Once enabled your users complain that their session expires two hours after they log in even if they are actively using iNotes..

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Domino is working as designed and it should also be noted that this behaviour will be seen for all SSO enabled Internet sites and not just iNotes. 

The SSO document for your LTPA Token has the Token Expiration 'Expiration (minutes):" field set to 120 minutes. This setting specifies the maximum validity time for a user's session and once reached cannot be dynamically extended regardless of the user's activity and the user must log in again.

While each organisation must set this value based on their own requirements, generally it is recommended that the session expiration time is set to 480 minutes (8 hours) and an Idle Session Timeout value be also enabled if doing so.

Some confusion regarding the fact that the Idle Session Timeout can be renewed exists with some customers who believe that the same action will occur for the Session Expiration time, but this is not the case. The Idle Session Timeout will be renewed if the user completes a network level operation in their browser such as sending an email, or navigating to a new page until the actual session expires. 

Given this it is recommended to set an appropriate value for the Idle Session Timeout as actions such as typing an email do not constitute a network level action and in some cases where the value was set to low users were logged out when typing a particularly long email. Please note however the Idle Session Timeout value cannot be greater than the value set for the Expiration (minutes) field.
