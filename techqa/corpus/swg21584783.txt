Title: IBM A CWSXM0100E error is received for WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB), WebSphere Process Server (WPS), or IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced - United States

Text:
CWSXM0100E; multiple; replies; single; request TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a single request is sent to a Mediation Flow Component in WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, WebSphere Process Server, or Business Process Manager Advanced, services can be invoked more than once. 

SYMPTOM
The following error message can be observed in the SystemOut.log file:

CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module <module_name> 

More than one invocation can occur from a single request.

CAUSE
This error occurs when a mediation primitive is wired more than once to the next mediation primitive. It might seem to be a single wire. However, upon closer inspection, more than one wire exists. 


By mistake, primitives might be wired more than once when there is only one wire. See the following screen shot:

If you move the primitives in question, however, you notice that there are more wires underneath:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584783&amp;aid=2]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve this problem, complete the following steps: 

 1. Delete any redundant wires. 
    
    
 2. Save the project.
    
    
 3. Redeploy the application to the server.
