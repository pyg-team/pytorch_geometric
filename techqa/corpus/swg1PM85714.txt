APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have a Statistics 21 installation that uses a single
   concurrent user license. You are using the Statistics
   functionality within that installation from the Modeler 15
   Statistics integration nodes after defining the connection using
   the Statistics license location utility as documented.
   
   In a Modeler client session you add a Statistics integration
   node (eg. Statistics transform node) to the stream and invoke
   the edit dialog of the node. This allows you you define the
   procedure within the node without any issues. However if you
   then attempt to execute a terminal node from this node you see
   an error:
   
   "No records recieved" or:
   "IBM SPSS Statistics Transform Node Error: Can't find valid
   license in:
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\21"
   
   If you save the stream, restart Modeler Client, load the stream
   into the new Modeler session and execute the terminal node
   without editing any Statistics nodes within the stream, you see
   the output expected rather than an execution error.
