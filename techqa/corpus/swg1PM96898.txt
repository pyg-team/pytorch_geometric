   In z/OS V2R1 Communications Server, the Digital Certificate
   Access Server ( DCAS) is enhanced to use
    Application Transparent Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS) . To
   secure the connection using TLS v1.2, users must define policy
   using AT-TLS for the DCAS .

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  In z/OS V2R1 Communications Server, the Digital Certificate
   Access Server ( DCAS) is enhanced to use
    Application Transparent Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS) . To
   secure the connection using TLS v1.2, users must define policy
   using AT-TLS for the DCAS .
   
   To allow DCAS to use the latest support for SSL/TLS, users
   should migrate to AT-TLS.   Configuring TLS/SSL through the DCAS
   configuration file is supported, but is deprecated and will no
   longer be enhanced.
   
   
   Implementation information will be included in the February 1,
   2014 refresh of z/OS documentation available at this site:
   http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/bkserv/ [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/bkserv/]
   
   If you wish to implement prior to the publication update you
   should contact IBM z/OS Communications Server to request an
   early version of the documentation.
