ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Property values are being changed from Arabic characters to
   numeric characters when a user views the properties of an item
   already added to the library system via IDM Web Services.  This
   does not happen with IDM Desktop clients.
   What sequence of events led up to or revealed the problem? :
   Using IDMWS in an Arabic environment.
   Is the problem reproducible on the customer{ascii_value:146}s
   system? Yes
   [Yes, only one system / Yes, across all systems (e.g. PROD,
   DEV, TEST) / No] Prod.
   Is the problem reproducible in-house? Yes
   FRC{ascii_value:146}s in-house lab details: Contact Fred Dunne
   to arrange access to the system.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since upgrading to IDMWS 4.0.  Customer stated that this does
   not occurr with IDMWS 3.3.
   Is there a workaround? : No
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : They are partners
   in Kuwait and their customers and their own language is
   Arabic, so they require that the FileNet software does not
   change their language to a series of numbers.
   Does this occur on more than one station? : Yes
   What was running on station/system/other displays at the time?
   : MSIE and IDMWS
   If something did not work as anticipated, what was expected? :
   For the characters in the Document Class property fields to
   stay as they left them.
   What happened instead? : The arabic characters got changed to
   numeric characters
   Are there any similar or related DTSs? : None for Arabic that I
   could see.
