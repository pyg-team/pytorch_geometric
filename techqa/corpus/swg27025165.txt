ABSTRACT
 This presentation covers migrating instances in IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.1 and WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2. The session examines several scenarios and outlines best practices for migrating and testing snapshots and in-flight instances. 

Level of Difficulty: Advanced 

Presenter(s): Mark Filley

Date: 24 May 2012 

CONTENT
This presentation discusses migrating instances with the BPM 7.5.1.0 product. This covers some of the ways instances may fail after migrating to a new snapshot. These details are in the linked presentation. After migrating instances some may fail or become stuck. The best way to solve this is to use the MoveToken REST API command.
