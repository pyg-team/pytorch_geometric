APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   Historical Summarized Performance, Historical Summarized
   Capacity and Historical Summarized Availability workspaces are
   still based on data warehouse tables of various superseded
   attribute groups. If customer has enabled only historical data
   collections on the corresponding new attribute groups no data
   can show up in these out of the box workspaces.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   Linux OS agent versions since 6.2.1, no dependency on OS
   platforms/versions.
   
   Diagnostics:
   The following message appears at the bottom of several views in
   the Historical Summarized workspaces that can be accessed from
   the "Linux Systems" navigation node:
   
   KFWITM217E Request error: [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/LINUXZ64]
   SQL0204N "ITMUSER.Linux_Network_MV" is an undefined name.
   SQLSTATE=42704,GENERIC SQLSTATE: 42S02, ERR: -204 SQLExecDirect
   rc=-1: SQL_ERROR
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low, this is only an issue with product provided out of the box
   workspaces.
   
   Additional Keywords:
   Linux_Network_MV,Linux_VM_Stats_MV,Linux_CPU_MV,Linux_Disk_Usage
   _Trends_MV,Linux_Disk_IO_MV,Linux_Process_MV
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define custom queries and custom workspaces that gather
   historical summarized data from the new tables. New tables are
   named KLZ_* instead of Linux_*
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Empty Historical Summarized built-in workspaces.
   
   
   All of the views in the Historical Summarized Performance,
   Historical Summarized Capacity and Historical Summarized
   Availability workspaces of the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS may
   display empty because of the following error:
    KFWITM217E Request error: [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/LINUXZ64]
   SQL0204N "ITMUSER.Linux_***_MV" is an undefined name.
   SQLSTATE=42704,GENERIC SQLSTATE: 42S02, ERR: -204SQLExecDirect
   rc=-1: SQL_ERROR
   This occurs because these views are still based on data
   warehouse tables of various attribute groups that are superseded
   since 6.21, and customer has historical data collections enabled
   only on the corresponding new tables.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  All the queries used by these workspace views have switched from
    the superseded Linux_***_MV tables to their corresponding new
   KLZ_***_MV tables.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   | FixPack    | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0006
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Define custom queries and workspaces that are copies of the
   built-in ones, but pointing to the new KLZ_***_MV tables
