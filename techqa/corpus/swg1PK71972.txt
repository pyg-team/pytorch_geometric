ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  LDAP users have their logins set to lower case when stored in th
   e database. When the user initially logs in using uppercase thei
   r account is created and they get a session. The LDAP users are
   disallowed from logging back in after they log off. They receive
    this message:
   
   Your account has logged in somewhere else and made your session
   invalid.
   
   As well as this system message getting logged:
   User id [0] was not found.
   
   To reproduce:
   Set up an Oracle 10g environment - Windows or UNIX host. I repro
   duced on a Windows database host
   Login initially with an LDAP user using all upper case letters.
   Log out
   Log back in using all uppercase letters
   
   At this point the system will let you in and then kick you out i
   mmediately.
   
   This same process occurs for built-in users who mix the case fro
   m when the account was created. For example - created as API_use
   r and logging in as api_user will not allow the log in.
   
   
   The root cause of this is Oracle is case sensitive. The SELECT q
   uery we issue to see if the user exists in the database keeps th
   e user name in all uppercase as it was entered. We can't globall
   y lowercase the login as the built in logins created in uppercas
   e would then be affected. The SELECT query we issue should have
   a clause where it looks for the LDAP users in lowercase as this
   is how we store them in the database and other users in the form
   at entered by the end user.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users who attempt to subsequently login with an ldap id
   using mixed or upper case get automatically booted from the
   system and cannot log in anymore (unless they login with
   their id in all lower case).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Updated the login authentication code paths to now process
   ldap id in a case insensitive manner.
