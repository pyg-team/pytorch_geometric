   errors can be seen in the error logs:
   
   Sender side:
   -----------
   AMQ9777: Channel was blocked
   The inbound channel 'TEST1.TO.TEST2' was blocked from address
   '123.456.789.999'
   
   Receiver side:
   -------------
   AMQ9509: Program cannot open queue manager object.
   EXPLANATION:
   
   The attempt to open either the queue or queue manager object
   'TEST1' on queue manager 'TEST1' failed with reason code 2018.
   
   AMQ9214: Attempt to use an unsupported communications protocol.
   EXPLANATION:
   
   An attempt was made to use an unsupported communications
   protocol type 0.
   
   There also is a CHLAUTH record defined on the receiver side for
   a receiver channel with WARN=YES.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Alter the CHLAUTH record to set WARN=NO and restart sender and
   receiver channels.
   
   runmqsc
   ALTER CHLAUTH (chl name) WARN(NO)
   end
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users with a CHLAUTH record with WARN=YES and channel events
   enabled
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A coding error resulted in the RCVR channel failing to start
   when there was a CHLAUTH record with WARN=YES, and channel
   events were enabled
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ queue manager logic has been updated to allow RCVR
   channels to start when there is a CHLAUTH record with WARN=YES,
   and channel events are enabled
