 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Product: Impromptu
Version: 7.0
Build: 554
Platform: Windows-all


Description:

How can I create a report that calculates the total sale for this year from the beginning of the year until today. Also, Total Sale for same period last year. 

year always starts on January 1



Solution:

One sub report for each year YTD total.

You will need to make use of sub-reports to be able to implement this calculation.

The main report calculates the year to date total for current year. 
The filter should look like this:
Date between 2002-01-01 and today()

Where Date is the date column in your report and Today () is an Impromptu built in function that returns todays date. 
You can also use Oracle's now function instead.


The sub-report calculates the YTD total for previous year.

The filter should look like this:
Date between 2001-01-01 and (datetime-to-date(add-years(Today(), -1)))

add-years: Is a built in Impromptu 
function that given a certain date, it adds or subtracts a certain number of years as per value passed.

Datetime-to-date: Is an Impromptu built in function that changes the format returned by add-years from datetime to date.
