APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you use undercover agents (UCAs) to trigger intermediate
   message events and the correlation string that is specified for
   each event contains multiple spaces, IBM Business Process
   Manager (BPM) does not find the corresponding process instances
   and the events are not triggered.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Multiple spaces within the correlation strings are replaced by a
   single space. Because the modified correlation string does not
   match any waiting intermediate message events,  the events are
   not triggered.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3 that ensures that the
   correlation strings of UCAs are no longer modified.
