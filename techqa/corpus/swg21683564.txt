Title: IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture reads Barcode 3of9 Extended incorrectly - United States

Text:
barcode 3of9 39; 3of9; 39 Extended; 3of9 Extended TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When reading a barcode formatted as 3of9 Extended (39 Extended), it adds extra characters to the value. 

SYMPTOM
The problem occurs when a barcode with a value of alpha/beta is read as alpha/0beta.


CAUSE
The 3of9 Extended format is actually the same as the 3of9 format but is interpreted differently, with some two character combinations read as a single character. This allows more characters to be encoded. However, Datacap has no way of knowing which format it actually is, so by default interprets the barcode as 3of9.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, disable 3of9.


 1. Run Datacap Studio and select the Zones tab. 
 2. Lock the DCO for editing. 
 3. In the Bar/P subtab, click on the Barcode Type field. 
 4. In the Barcode Type window, uncheck CODE 39 and click OK. 
 5. Save and unlock the DCO.
