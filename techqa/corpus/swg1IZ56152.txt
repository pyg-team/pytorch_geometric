   Abstract:        Can't install Language Pack of ITM4DB to TEPS
                    on 64bit AIX
   
   Environment:
   ITM 6.2.1 TEPS running on AIX 5.3 64 bit
   ITM for Database 6.2 Language Pack (P/N:C17L5ML)
   
   Problem Description:
   This is a known defect of CVMC#80104.  I open this APAR to get
   the fix in the future MDV.
   
   Japanese translated resource files, i.e. lp_db_ja.jar, wasn't
   installed to TEPS running on 64bit AIX even though the
   installation of ITM for DB Language Pack was completed
   successfully.   Because localized resource files can't be copied
   to $CANDLEHOME/aix536/cw directory, the customer cannot see
   Japanese messages on TEP Browser or TEP Java Web Start.
   
   Workaround:
   None.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Install TEMS(64bit) and TEPS(64bit) to 64bit AIX 5.3
   2. Configure TEMS (itmcmd config -S -t HUB_name, itmcmd support)
   3. Configure TEPS (itmcmd config -A cq)
   4. Install ITM for DB support files (need to issue itmcmd
      support command)
   5. Install Japanese language pack of ITM for DB ... completed
   successfully
   6. Reconfigure TEPS (itmcmd config -A cq)
   7. Launch TEP (Java WebStart) or Browser TEP
      --> ITM for DB related resources are displayed in English.
      --> There is no translated resources (e.g. lp_db_ja.jar)
          under /opt/IBM/ITM/aix536 directory

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Japanese translated resource files, i.e. lp_db_ja.jar, was not
   installed to the portal server running on 64bit AIX even though
   the installation of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for DB Language Pack
   was completed successfully. Because localized resource files
   cannot be copied to $CANDLEHOME/aix536/cw directory, the
   customer cannot see Japanese messages in portal client browser
   or portal client Java Web Start.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added the proepr IAX 64 bit platform to include for this
   Japanese language
