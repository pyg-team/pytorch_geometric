Title: IBM Java applets are blocked in IBM FileNet IDM Open Client when launched in Chrome with NPAPI disabled - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The ability to launch and display Open Client Java applets (also known as plug-ins) in a Chrome browser depends on the presence of the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI). As of Chrome 42, NPAPI is disabled by default. Therefore, web applications which use Java applets will have reduced functionality unless NPAPI is manually re-enabled 

CAUSE
When using a Chrome 42 (or later) browser, any functionality which depends on launching a Java applet such as Open Client's ViewONE applet viewer, it will be unavailable.
Chrome is deprecating NPAPI according to this published schedule: https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation [https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation] 

By September, 2015 NPAPI will be completely removed. Until then work arounds are available as documented in the above link. 


ANSWER
Chrome is available for Windows, Mac and other environments. 


The following table lists known affected functionality: 

 

Product or Component Functionality Notes Daeja ViewONE Professional and Standard Entire Product cannot run Daeja ViewONE Virtual is not affected [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964637&amp;aid=1] Features in IBM Content Navigator that are available as Java applets will not run. For example:  *  Sending documents by email File tracking Opening documents in applet-based viewers, such as the applet viewer, the line data applet viewer, and the IBM Daeja ViewONE Professional viewer Deleting teamspaces by using task manager Using plug-ins that provide Java applet integrations, such as the plug-ins provided for workflow design and management 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964637&amp;aid=1] Resolving the problem As of Chrome Version 42, an additional configuration step is required to continue using NPAPI plug-ins: 


1. In the browser URL bar, enter: chrome://flags/#enable-npapi 
2. Click the Enable link for the Enable NPAPI configuration option. 
3. Click the Relaunch button that now appears at the bottom of the configuration page.

By September, 2015 NPAPI will be completely removed. Until then, workarounds are available as documented here: https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation [https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation]

IBM recommends customers move to another supported browser, including FireFox or Internet Explorer. IDM Open Client is supported in the following browsers: http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/prereqsForProduct?deliverableId=1233042227182 [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/prereqsForProduct?deliverableId=1233042227182]
