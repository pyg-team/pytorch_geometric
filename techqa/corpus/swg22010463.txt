CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5664
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper handling of specific HTTP request methods for static error pages by the Default Servlet error page mechanism. By sending a specially crafted GET request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass HTTP method restrictions and cause the deletion or replacement of the target error page.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7674 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7674]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin by the CORS Filter. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct client and server side cache poisoning.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248] for the current score
