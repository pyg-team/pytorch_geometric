APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When shared libraries are configured at the server scope and
   referenced using a classloader, the FEM component does not have
   access to those artifacts. Inorder to make this work a reference
   of the shared library must be added to each application when it
   is deployed. This APAR is to address that limitation within FEM
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  no
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Process Server 6.2.0.x users      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: BPC Explorer or Failed Event Manager    *
   *                      may not work correctly when processes   *
   *                      depend upon artifacts deployed in       *
   *                      shared library.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In a Golden topology, if the user has shared libraries
   configured on application cluster and BPC Explorer is running
   support cluster (or FEM on DMgr), then these applications may
   not be work correctly since the artifacts in a shared library
   are not visible to these applications. BPC uses Remote AL
   functionality to locate these artifacts but Remote AL only
   indexes the artifacts in the business application and not in
   the shared library.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Enhanced Remote AL functionality to additionally index
   artifacts from shared library and make them visible to
   applications running on different servers.
