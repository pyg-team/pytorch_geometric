APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During restoration VM status changed to deleted in IWD until
   restoration completes, as this captured Image is not registered
   or known to IWD/PCG we are requesting status from Openstack/PCG
   with ID 0 and hence it is failing.
   
   
   
   API exception occurs when SL image restore takes place:
   
   GET
   https://api.service.softlayer.com/rest/v3/SoftLayer_Account/Priv [https://api.service.softlayer.com/rest/v3/SoftLayer_Account/Priv]
   
   ateBlockDeviceTemplateGroups/0.json?objectMask=mask[tagReference
   
   s,children[blockDevices[diskImage[softwareReferences[softwareDes
   
   c ription]]]]]
   
   The ID is 0.json so it is bound to fail.
