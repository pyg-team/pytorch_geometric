 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Where is the SPSS I/O module for Windows and the documentation? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide tools for writing plugins via a C api, including a C api for Statistics.


The programmability Software Development kits (SDKs) for Statistics versions 20, 19, and 18 are available on the Developer Works site in this collection [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/files/app?lang=en#/collection/9c63bfe8-ffb7-4594-915b-73b222feb1d1] [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/files/app?lang=en#/collection/9c63bfe8-ffb7-4594-915b-73b222feb1d1]. 

The SPSS I/O modules provide a way to read and write SPSS data files (SAV files) without a Statistics installation. While multiple versions are provided, the newest one can be used for all of the Statistics versions. The downloads contain the material for all the platforms supported by Statistics. The license terms on this page are different from the general developerWorks license used for other items, but they are intended to encourage broad usage of this material. 

 * The modules for Statistics Version 20 are available here [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/signup.do?source=swg-tspssp&lang=en_US&S_PKG=dl] [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/signup.do?source=swg-tspssp&lang=en_US&S_PKG=dl]. 
 * The modules matching Statistics versions 18 and 19 are available here [https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?source=swg-tspssp]. [https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?source=swg-tspssp]
