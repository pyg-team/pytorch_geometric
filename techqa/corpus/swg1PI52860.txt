PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In "Administrative User Groups" panel,  *
   *                      group search does not show any hits     *
   *                      although there are valid groups.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In the "Administrative User Groups" panel, group search does
   not show any hits although valid groups do exist. The issue
   only happens when there are multiple user registries
   configured in the same realm name.  There was a bug that
   incorrectly selected an inactive user registry when
   Application Server performed a group search.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was fixed so that the group search is performed on
   the active user registry.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.10.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
   page for delivery information:

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The temporary fix is to change the realm name for the inactive
   user registry to make it different from the active user
   registry's realm name.
