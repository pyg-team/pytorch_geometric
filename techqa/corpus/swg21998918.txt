 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities have been identified in the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. IBM Security Access Manager appliances use NSS and are affected by these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2016-2834 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2834]
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-5285 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5285]
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in PK11_SignWithSymKey / ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime when handling invalid Diffie-Hellman keys. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash a TLS/SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID:CVE-2016-8635 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8635]
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a small subgroup confinement attack in Diffie Hellman Client key exchange handling. By confining the client DH key to small subgroup of the desired group, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover private keys.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190]for the current score
