APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an LU62 channel connects to a qmgr which has
   CHLAUTH(ENABLED) and a CHLAUTH rule with TYPE(ADDRESSMAP), the
   channel authentication code attempts to process the channel's
   LU62 connection name as an IP address. This results in an
   unexpected error in the parsing code, causing the abend
   5C6-00E7014F and message CSQX774E reporting all inbound
   channels being blocked.
   
   Below messages were displayed in CHIN joblog:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 8       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: LU62 Channels will not start when       *
   *                      ADDRESSMAP ChlAuth rules are applied to *
   *                      them                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   When an ADDRESSMAP ChlAuth Rule is applied to an LU62 Channel to
   block an IP Address, the LU62 ChlAuth validation will fail
   preventing the channel from being started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ChlAuth checks that include the use of IP Addresses have been
   stopped for channels of type 'LU62'.
