ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  *****************************************************
   Title:Unable to create a ITIM account even though the Org Role
   set
   that has the person listed under Person list of Org Dynmic Role.
   
   
   
   Problem Description:
   
   
   
   The requirment is as follows:
   1. We have two kinds of Oranisation roles for our TIM Deployment
   -
   Students and Staff.
   2. Requirment here is - a TIM person can either be of the
   following
   role(s)
    a. Staff
    b. Student
    c. Student and a Staff (indicates that the Person has a Student
   role
   first and then later we add the Staff role)
    d. Staff and a Student indicates that the Person has a Staff
   role first
   and then later we add the Student role)\
   
   TEST CASES - Evertime we create a TIM person, we have the
   following
   types of accounts to be provisioned for the TIM Person
      Case A. When a TIM person is created with a role as staff,
   then the
   following account is provisioned automatically:
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a hosted service)
         The provisioning Policies are Automatic.
         The ERUID used for the above Staff Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "sXXXXXX"
   
       Case  B. When a TIM person is created with a role as
   Student, then
   the following account is provisioned automatically:
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a normal TIM service)
         The provisioning Policies are Automatic.
         The ERUID used for the above Student Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "pXXXXXX"
   
       Case C. We create a TIM Person with Staff role and this the
   following account is provisioned automatically
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a hosted service)
         The ERUID used for the above Staff Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "sXXXXXX"
         Now, we add the Student role to this TIM Person, and thus
   the
   following account should be provisioned automatically for this
   person:
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a normal TIM service)
        The ERUID used for the above Student Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "pXXXXXX"
        Now, in this case, we see that the TIM Account for the
   Student is
   not created.
       Case D. We create a TIM Person with Student role and this
   the
   following account is provisioned automatically
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a normal TIM service)
           The ERUID used for the above Student Accounts are same
   and is of
   type "pXXXXXX"
           Now, we add the Staff role to this TIM Person, and thus
   the
   following account should be provisioned automatically for this
   person:
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a hosted service)
            The ERUID used for the above Staff Accounts are same
   and is of
   type "sXXXXXX"
            Now, in this case, we see that the TIM Account for the
   Staff
   and Student is created properly.
   
   Org Role set to dynamic
   
   Staff role is
   (&(&(spStaffStatus=Active)(spStaffCategory=FT))(pager-1))
   
   and
   
   
   
   
   
   Customr Recreate: yes
   L2 Support Recreate: yes
   
   Desired Behavior:
   
   Able to create a ITIM account even though the Org Role set
   that has the person listed under Person list of Org Dynmic Role.
   
   
   Steps Duplicate:
   
       Case C. We create a TIM Person with Staff role and this the
   following account is provisioned automatically
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a hosted service)
         The ERUID used for the above Staff Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "sXXXXXX"
         Now, we add the Student role to this TIM Person, and thus
   the
   following account should be provisioned automatically for this
   person:
     i. TIM Account. (TIM Account service is a normal TIM service)
        The ERUID used for the above Student Accounts are same and
   is of
   type "pXXXXXX"
        Now, in this case, we see that the TIM Account for the
   Student is
   not created.
