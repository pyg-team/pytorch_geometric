SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 19, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. IBM DataPower Gateway has addressed the corresponding applicable CVEs. 


VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0287 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0287]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error related to the reuse of a structure in ASN.1 parsing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an invalid write to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101668 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101668] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0289 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0289]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle missing outer ContentInfo by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blob to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0292 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0292]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error when processing base64 encoded data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted base 64 data to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101670 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101670] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0293 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0293]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially-crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671] for the current score
