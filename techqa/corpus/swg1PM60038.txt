ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The xmllib->XPATH() function returns invalid data when running
   on zLinux with WTX 8.3.0.4.
   For example, a map should return data as the text value of "My
   Data" but instead garbled data of " .  ±    Â  "
   is returned.
   Same map returns the correct text value of "My Data" on Windows
   with WTX 8.3.0.4 and on zLinux using WTX 8.3.0.3.
