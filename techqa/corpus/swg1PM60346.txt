ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - Client has an analysis studio report that is migrated from
   cognos 8.4.1 FP2 to cognos 10.1.1
                                        ?- he has drill down setup
   in this report, so few of the items are not drilling up/down as
   they used to do in cognos 8.4.1
              ?- if we right click the items then we notice that
   drill down and up are greyed up while they are available to
   drill on the other items in the same column?
   
        ?Report name is :Customer usage report
                                   ?items name : Royal laser MFG
                                                              ?
   
                        ?- Client shows me that the report works
   fine in cognos 8.4.1                               ?- we removed
   all suppressions in analysis studio, and we were able to
                ?drill down but it didn't give us the whole data
   back                                       ?- tried in report
   studio (10.1.1) same problem happened but if we add
           ?"200" to the "Rows per page" so that all items appear
   in 1 page the                        ?problem will occur
   
   ?
                              ?- Client was unable to replicate
   with our samples due to the extra data                    ?they
   have in the report
                        ?- Cube datasource
                                                   ?- They are
   willing to send the cube but need a permission
                  ?- will investigate further today to check if
   there is bug on that                          ?otherwise will
   ask for cube
