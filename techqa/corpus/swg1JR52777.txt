ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After migrating from WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.x to IBM
   Business Process Manager V8.5.5, I get the following exception
   while importing a process application:

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If process applications imported from WebSphere Lombardi Edition
   use the TWTimePeriod JavaScript object and the version of the
   System Data toolkit does not match the version of IBM Business
   Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.5 or later releases, you see the
   exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Upgrade the version of the System Data toolkit to match the
   version of IBM BPM you have.
