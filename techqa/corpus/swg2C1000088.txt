OVERVIEW: 

Google is suggesting that you should upgrade to Apache Cordova 4.1.1 or higher. While it is correct that open source Apache Cordova prior to version 4.1.1 contains these vulnerabilities, this is not the case for IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation users who have applied the IBM iFixes for the vulnerabilities. 

The iFixes are available from Fix Central with builds dating July 7, 2015 and later. 

Note: The Cordova version embedded in IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation / IBM Worklight cannot be upgraded to a higher version. You must apply the fixes from Fix Central to update Cordova.
