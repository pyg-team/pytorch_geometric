Overview: 

The offering provides end-to-end, lifecycle support for business decisions invoked from COBOL and PL/I applications. This includes capabilities for decision testing and simulation within the zRule Execution Server (zRES) for z/OS environment and the ability to trace the execution of how a business decision is made in the zRule Execution Server through the Decision Warehouse feature. 

IBM ODM for z/OS provides multiple, business-rule execution choices for z/OS customers. This includes a business rule deployment option for Enterprise COBOL, PL/I, and IMS batch applications, which can run stand-alone or hosted within a CICS 4.x or CICS 5.x region. IBM ODM for z/OS also provides support for decision evaluation for COBOL and PL/I applications in IMS environments, both online and batch (support of IMS V10 and later) with the zRule Execution Server for z/OS . 

New and enhanced capabilities in IBM ODM for z/OS , V8.5: 

 * Support for PL/I Language - Extends your ability to utilize decision management and modernize your applications. 
 * Improved CICS and IMS integration with the Decision Engine - Includes performance improvements and persistent connection support. 
 * Expanded support for Decision Engine - Now available on WebSphere Application Server for z/OS . 
 * Simpler deployment configuration - Includes control card-based deployment definitions. 
 * Comprehensive change management and governance - Includes a design that is based on the new Decision Governance Framework, a ready-to-use, prescriptive approach for both large enterprises and small and medium businesses.

IBM ODM for z/OS and IBM Business Rules for z/OS , available as a separate product, help enable organizations in virtually every industry to improve the quality of transaction, batch, and process-related decisions that are made repeatedly within mainframe applications and to determine the appropriate courses of action for each customer, partner, and internal interaction by:  * Automating and governing operational decision making across business processes and applications to help improve business outcomes 
 * Helping detect opportunities and risks in real time 
 * Easily and consistently implementing changes to meet new market demands or policy requirements 
 * Supporting incremental modernization of existing CICS , IMS , and batch applications written in COBOL or PL/I without a complete re-write 
 * Facilitating consistent decision evaluation across platforms, projects, and processes by allowing the reuse of business models between rule projects in z/OS and distributed applications 
 * Detecting events and event patterns in real time to enable situational awareness and response of actionable situations ( IBM ODM) 
 * Automating the response of highly variable decisions based on the specific context of a process, transaction, or interaction 
 * Managing and governing rules-based decision logic separately from application code in order to provide better visibility, understanding, and maintainability compared to traditional application development 
 * Integrating with a number of other z/OS technologies to create comprehensive decision management solutions written in COBOL or PL/I, using CICS , IMS , or z/OS batch execution environments.
