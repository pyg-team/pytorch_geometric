Version 2.2.2.2 includes fixes for these security vulnerabilities:

CVEID: CVE-2016-6302 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6302]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length by the tlsdecrypt_ticket function A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a ticket that is too short to cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By repeatedly requesting renegotiation, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large OCSP Status Request extension to consume all available memory resources.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.

CVEID: CVE-2016-3485 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3485]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Networking component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5573 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5573]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Hotspot component has high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and high availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5542 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5542]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5597 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5597]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5387 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5387]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to redirect HTTP traffic of CGI application, caused by the failure to protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. By using a specially-crafted Proxy header in a HTTP request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect outbound HTTP traffic to arbitrary proxy server. This is also known as the "HTTPOXY" vulnerability.


See the following known limitations:

A warning event is generated when a user attempts to create a collection set on the system. 

Problem: A warning event is generated creating a collection set.

The problem is due to an issue parsing the hostname of an LDAP server described in the "LDAP provider URL". Resolution: Change the LDAP hostname to the IP address or the fully qualified hostname. 

The following table contains the Authorized Program Analysis Reports (APARs) included in this release. If an integrated pattern or component is not listed, there were no fixes for that pattern or component in this version.
