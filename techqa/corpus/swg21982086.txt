AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

Principal Product and Version(s) Product Code IBM® Tivoli® Monitoring for Virtual Environments Agent for VMware VI versions 6.1.0 , 6.1.2 , 6.2.1 , 6.2.2 , 6.2.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.2.0.2 KVM REMEDIATION/FIXES
VMware agent installs a Java runtime (J6 component) which is not the default Java runtime component installed by ITM framework (default is JM component on windows and JR component on non-windows).

The CVEs listed in the Vulnerability Details section above affect the Java shipped as part of the VMware VI agent.

To remediate the vulnerabilities do the following:
1. Follow the steps in the technote to update the VMware VI agent to use the JRE shipped as a shared component IBM Tivoli Monitoring (default is JM component on windows and JR component on non-windows).
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883100 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883100].

2. Update the shared component Java (CANDLEHOME) using the patch(es) listed: 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6 JRE Update (6.X.X-TIV-ITM_JRE_CANDLEHOME-20160408 ) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041511]
