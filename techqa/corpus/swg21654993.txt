QUESTION
 Steps to do a silent install of the ITCAM for J2EE WebLogic DC. 

ANSWER
These are the detailed and easy steps to do a silent install of the ITCAM for J2EE DC for a WebLogic server: 

(Note: This is for an Unix-based J2EE WebLogic DC but can be used for a J2EE WebLogic DC on Windows also. Just change the paths in the attached response file to the Windows format. Also note that this is a silent install only. To do a silent configuration [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21655376] of the J2EE DC, please check this link [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21655376].) 

1. Set the JAVA_HOME variable to the JRE path being used. Most DC installations will require JRE 1.5 or higher. To set the JAVA_HOME, simply use the export command. For example, export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java6 

2. Detach the attached default itcam_install.rsp file provided here. Open this file and check the default paths being used in the file. If you have different install paths on your system, change it and save the response file. 

3. Check the userid being used to install the DC. In my case this is root. In your case, the userid may be non-root but must have sufficient permissions to read, write and execute the files under the J2EE WebLogic server directories. 

4. Check file permissions of the DC install image. If they need to be changed, do it now with the chmod command. 

5. Now run the silent install as shown in the screenshot below. Immediately after the silent install command, do a echo $? as shown in the screenshot below and check the return code, it should say 0. If not, then you have an error, look at the install.log to see what caused it.

6. The install will take about 2 minutes or less to complete successfully and will create the directories specified in your itcam_install.rsp response file. Check the directories created. If you do not see any ITCAM directories created, look at your install.log and trace-install.log log files. I've also attached a clean install.log here so you can compare with your install.log if you get an error. 

7. Install the latest fixpacks for the DC and TEMA and then configure the DC, either using a silent configuration [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21655376] or a GUI configuration.
