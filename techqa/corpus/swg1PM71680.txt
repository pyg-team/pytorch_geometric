ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  VOB Feature Level 6 was introduced with IBM Rational ClearCase
   7.1.2.2.
   A VOB server running ClearCase 8.0.0 hosting a VOB replica of a
   Feature Level 6 VOB,
   is unable to syncreplica packets generated on a 7.1.2 VOB
   server, and generates packets that are not readable by a 7.1.2
   VOB server.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   EITHER
   Take an existing VOB family at Feature Level 6, with all replica
   servers running 7.1.2.x  and upgrade one of the replica servers
   to ClearCase MultiSite 8.0.0
   OR
   Take an existing VOB family at Feature Level 5 (or lower) hosted
   on a mix of ClearCase 7.1.2 and 8.0.0 servers and raise the
   family feature level to 6 (after raising the replica feature
   levels).
   
   Then generate syncreplica packets and try to import them.
   ===
   Import reports:
   
   multitool: Warning: Cannot read header of packet
   /opt/rational/clearcase/shipping/ms_ship/incoming/sync_abc_2012-
   08-
   23T095226+0200_2316: Invalid argument
   multitool: Error: File
   /opt/rational/clearcase/shipping/ms_ship/incoming/sync_abc_2012-
   08-
   23T095228+0200_8428 is not a sync. packet
   ===
   
   
   Workaround:
   
   Revert a newly upgraded VOB server from 8.0.0 to 7.1.2.7
      [Before any VOBs it hosts have been reformatted to schema 80]
   OR
   Upgrade all VOB servers to 8.0.0.3
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ClearCase MultiSite syncreplica imports fail between VOB servers
   running ClearCase 7.1.2.x and ClearCase 8.0.0.x for replicas in
   a Feature Level 6 VOB family, because of packet header mismatch
   in ClearCase 8.0.0.x.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available in ClearCase version 8.0.0.4
