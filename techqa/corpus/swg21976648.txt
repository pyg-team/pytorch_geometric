QUESTION
 Does running the ITCAM cyn_collector.sh script cause any impacts to my WAS production servers? 

ANSWER
Sometimes the ITCAM Support team will request you to run the cyn_collector.sh (cyn_collector.cmd on Windows) script. 

This script is used to collect configuration and logs from your configured WAS server. There's no impact to your WAS production server when you run the cyn_collector.sh script, so running it while your WAS servers are in production will not be a problem. The only thing is make sure you have plenty of available disk space (at least about 2 to 3 GB) in the / file system. 

Similarly, if you are using a non-WebSphere J2EE server like JBoss, Tomcat or WebLogic, there's no impacts to the server. In this case, you will run the cyn_collector_j2.sh script.
