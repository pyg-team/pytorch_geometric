APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a client application performs many MQCONN/MQDISC calls during
   its lifetime then memory usage in amqrmppa may be seen to grow
   continuously until resource errors occur.
   
   FDC's generated at failure time typically contain the following:
   Probe Id           :- XY132002
   Application Name   :- MQM
   Component          :- xstCreateExtent
   Program Name       :- amqrmppa
   Probe Description  :- AMQ6119: An internal WebSphere MQ error
   has occurred
   (Failed to get memory segment: shmget(0x14802825, 159744)
   [rc=-1 errno=22] Invalid argument)
   Comment1           :- Failed to get memory segment:
   shmget(0x14802825,159744) [rc=-1 errno=22] Invalid argument
   Comment2           :- Invalid argument
   
   The error log may contain:
   
   AMQ6119: An internal WebSphere MQ error has occurred (Failed to
   get memory segment:
   shmget(0x1480950d, 159744) ?rc=-1 errno=22? Invalid argument.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users whose applications perform many MQCONN/MQDISC MQI calls
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   In version 7 of WebSphere MQ, code was added to thread startup
   which allocated some memory for a couple of control blocks.
   This memory should have been freed before the thread was
   destroyed but this was not happening.  This meant that each time
   a thread was created/destroyed, the parent process was seen to
   be consuming memory that was not being released.
   
   Eventually, the amount of memory used may be such that the
   system runs out of available resource, causing MQ to generate
   low resource FDCs and messages in the error logs.
   
   By calling MQCONN/MQDISC, a client application would cause
   amqrmppa to create/destroy threads which results in the process
   gradually using up available memory.
   
   This problem is not specific to amqrmppa and may be seen in any
   MQ process which has a high turnover of threads.  The way that
   amqrmppa works does however make the problem more noticeable for
   this process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The control blocks are now freed before each thread is
   destroyed.
