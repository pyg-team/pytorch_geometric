APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create a managed node profile by using the BPMConfig
   command and you specify default ports by setting the
   bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions=-defaultPorts property in the
   configuration properties file, the -defaultPorts option is
   ignored and the node agent is created by using the port
   assignments computed by WebSphere Application Server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  -Defaultports should set the proper port settings

   ****************************************************************
   The BPMConfig command did not pass the - defaultPorts option
   from the bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions configuration file
   property when it created a managed node profile. As a result,
   the -defaultPorts option does not work as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.5 that ensures the
   BPMConfig command passes the -defaultPorts option (if it is
   specified) from the bpm.de.node.#.profileOptions configuration
   file property when creating the node agent.
