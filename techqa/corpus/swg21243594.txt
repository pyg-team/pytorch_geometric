PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) or IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) support team needs to see what version of the product is installed, they will ask you to run a script that outputs product version and installed patch information. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The version script gathers the current product version information including what patches are installed. The script name varies by major version release of the product.
