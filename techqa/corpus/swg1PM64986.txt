APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Set a parent page style to white and then create a child page
   for that parent. When hovering over the child page title and/or
   selecting it caused the title background to turn very dark blue
   making the title hard to read. This also didn't match the white
   page style.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To fix, you have to change a couple parameters in the white.css
   file located in /fs-type1/themes/Portal8.0/css/white/. Find
   the parameter called "filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft
   .gradient" and change the startColorstr variable to "#ffffffff".
   For the endColorstr variable, add "ff" at the beginning of the
   string (i.e. "#ededed" changes to "#ffededed").
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The navigation menu text on certain levels was not visible when
   the theme skin was set to white.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modification was done to the CSS and HTML to get the page to
   properly display when the theme skin was set to white.
