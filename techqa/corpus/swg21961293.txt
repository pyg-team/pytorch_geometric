 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL released fixes for several security vulnerabilities that may affect TPM for OS Deployment and TPM for Images customers. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0286]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp function when attempting to compare ASN.1 boolean types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash any certificate verification operation and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101666 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101666] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0288 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0288]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the X509_to_X509_REQ function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0289 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0289]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle missing outer ContentInfo by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blob to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0293 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0293]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially-crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101671] for the current score
