ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Permissions required to create a mailox in Powershell do not
   work when
   using the AD Adapter.
   
   
   Description:
   
   The customer has configured an account in AD that they are
   planning to
   use to manage AD and Exchange.  The user is able to successfully
   provision an account in AD including a mailbox, but the same
   user fails
   to create a mailbox when used to run the AD Adapter.
   
   BSE:11/11/08 07:37:11 Thread:002648 016.     <attr
   name="erademailboxstore" errorMessage="Error creating mailbox.
   No
   provisioning handler is installed.">
   
   User is a member of:
   Account Operators
   DNRGen
   Domain Users
   mpnfg
   Recipient Management
   View Only Organization Management
   
   If domain Administrator and Exchange Administrator access is
   granted,
   the provisioning is successful
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   Attempt to provision an AD Account and mailbox to a new user, or
   try to
   add a mailbox to an existing user.
   
   Desired Behavior:
   the user should be able to successfully create an AD Account and
   mailbox
   with the adapter.
   
   Environment:
   
   AD64bit adapter 5.1.7
   ITIM 5.1 FP6
   
   Windows Server 2008 R2 64
   
   Exchange Server 2010 SP1
   
   Can you please provide me as much detail as possible about your
   AD
   environment and network hierarchy?
   
   
   
   Single forrest, single domain ? utmb.edu
   
   
   
   What are the non-default groups you have for this user?  e.g.
   DNRGen,
   mpnfg ? groups serve no access role. Just used to identify
   certain
   special users.
   Where are the Exchange servers? utmb.edu
   What domain is the adapter machine in? utmb.edu
   
   As far as exchange goes..
   
   Exchange sits on a separate active directory site other than the
   campus
   AD Site (where all the users reside). We have the main campus AD
   site. A
   guhn site where the primary exchange nodes reside, and then a
   3rd site
   in Arlington where other exchange nodes sit for site resiliency.
   We have
   1 DAG that contains 8 mailbox databases. The DAG is stretched
   from the
   Guhn site to the Arlington site.. The Guhn site contains 4
   mailbox
   nodes, 2 UM nodes, 4 CAS/HUB nodes, 2 public folder servers. The
   Arlington site contains 2 mailbox nodes, 4 CAS/HUB nodes, and a
   public
   folder server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Reengineering of adapter to use remote powershe
   ll commands. Solution will ship in ISIM 6.0. Work around is to p
   ut the adapter's account into the domain admins group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Place adapter account in the domain admin group.
