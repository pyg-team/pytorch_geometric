Title: IBM FIPS Certification in Guardium Data Encryption - United States

Text:
NIST; ISO-19790:2012 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is Guardium Data Encryption Expert ("GDEE", "GDE", "DEE") certified to FIPS 140-2 ("Federal Information Processing Standard 140, revision 2")? 

CAUSE
Certain industries require FIPS certification. The certification process is long and involves multiple parties so certifications may be often out-of-date with respect to current released software. As a result of the prolonged lag time, vendors may submit a product for certification, receiving an "in process" status and customers may make a determination of compliance based upon the in-process status and a history of certifying previous releases.

ANSWER
The Guardium Data Encryption Expert ("GDEE", "GDE", "DEE") product is composed of a server and an agent that runs locally on each host. Each component handles sensitive cryptographic material ("SCM") subject to the FIPS 140-2 standard.

A list of all validated FIPS modules is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm]

Listed FIPS certificates for Vormetric back to 2012:
2343 (24-Mar-2015) covers the agent version 5.1.3 (Windows, HP-UX, AIX)
2342 (24-Mar-2015) covers the agent version 5.1.3 (linux)
1745 (25-May-2012) covers the hardware DSM, firmware version 4.4.1
1721 (05-Jun-2012) covers agent version 4.4.1 (Windows, linux, HP-UX)

The cryptographic boundary on the Version 4 DSM includes the hardware enclosure, and does not cover the software-only Guardium Data Encryption Product.

The version 5 DSM is listed as in-process (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/inprocess.html [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/inprocess.html]). As with the Version 4 device, the cryptographic boundary covers the entire hardware appliance (excluding the replaceable power supplies and front bezel). The software-only GDE installation is not covered under this certificate application.
