   Issue occurs at the cusotmer site during a incremental sync!
   Tunrned off the prebuilds as well as raised jvms
   (awaiting customer feedback on how the sync ran now- will update
   once I get feedback on possible work around)
   
   environemnt:
   TADDM 7.2
   
   ecmdb/domain running on zLinux
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  try turning off the prebuilds on the ecmdb and raise jvm (it
   sometimes works)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  OutOfMemory errors in CustomNodeFinderImpl and
   SimpleNodeFinderImpl in 7.2.0. This typically occurs during
   view
   builds and can effect any activity that drives view build(sync,
   UI, post discovery, etc.). It is most likely to occur on systems
   with more then 10k computer systems(select count(*) from
   CompSys).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   | Fix Pack | 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITADDM-FP0001
   
   Please check the TADDM Support Site for availability
   of the above maintenance package.
