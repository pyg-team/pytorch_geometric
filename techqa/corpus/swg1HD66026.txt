ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CATIVpmAggrAttribute API RemoveValue by Index
   Does Not Work
   CATIVpmAggrAttribute API, RemoveValue by
   index, does not function as documented.
   The API is used to try and remove values in a Multi-
   Valued attribute; the API returns S_OK, but after a
   refresh from the DB, the values are still there.
   .
   Following is the step-by-step scenario:
   1) Create a Workspace that removes a list of
   values from a Multi-Valued Attribute on Modify
   using the RemoveValue (by index) API.
   .
   2) A sample workspace is provided in a zip file
   uploaded to the PMR, that is fired when Editing an
   Item Instance
   .
   3) Launch ENOVIA with the User Exit declared in a
   CustomEnv
   .
   4) Create an Item Instance in a configured PRC
   .
   5) Add Values to the Discipline Attribute.For
   example: MV-1,MV-2,MV-3
   .
   6) Lock the newly created instance
   .
   7) Click the Edit button
   .
   8) Type Description in the Description Field
   .
   9) Click OK
   .
   10) The ENOVIA trace file displays the return code
   of 0, suggesting that the values were properly
   removed from the Multi-Valued Attribute.
   .
   Expected Results: The Values are not displayed in
   the GUI after a Refresh from the Database
   .
   Actual Results: After OK is selected and the trace
   file suggests that the values are removed, the
   Values are still displayed in the GUI.
   Click the Save Icon and Refresh from the Database
   the values were not deleted and are still present in
   the GUI.
   .
   I have checked the scenario on R19rel. The issue is
   reproducible.
   .
   Let me know if you need any more information.
