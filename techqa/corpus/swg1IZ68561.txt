   Please verify and confirm (seen the parameter in V7.3 Trap
   Probe)
   
   L2 Engineer:
   
   The ' RawCaptureFileBackup' is one of the general property for
   the probes.
   
   RawCaptureFileBackup <boolean> -  Specifies whether the raw
   capture file is backed up when it exceeds its maximum file size,
   determined by the MaxRawFileSize property.
   By default, the file is not backed up.
   
   You can find explination of 'RawCaptureFileBackup' property in
   Cisco info center documentation (3.6)
   http://www.cisco.com.akadns.net/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_info_c
   enter/3.6.1/administrator/guide/aguide.pdf [http://www.cisco.com.akadns.net/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_info_center/3.6.1/administrator/guide/aguide.pdf]
   
   However I guess it has been missed in the documentation customer
   is referring.
   
   OMNIbus L3 updated -  It looks like the RawCaptureFileBackup
   property has not been supported since the 3.6 timeframe.  It
   should be removed from the template .props file
