ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Quintus #225183
   
   With a model loaded, if I select an
   element in the browser and 'Edit Unit...' to deselect the option
   'Include in next load', the item still loads every way I have
   tried to
   reload the model. I've tried reloading the model from the Files
   menu and
   selecting the name of the recently opened project, and I've
   tried using
   the Open button and selecting the project with various options
   including
   'Restore Last Session'. In all cases, the unit I did not want to
   load,
   seems to load and the 'Include in next load' option is always
   returned
   to being checked.
   Of course, if I just manually unload the unit first things work
   ok using
   these various methods to reload the model but if I want to
   momentarily
   keep a unit loaded but set it so that it will not load the next
   time
   (which I thought was the intent of this option), I can't seem to
   get
   that to work. I am using Rhapsody 7.4.
