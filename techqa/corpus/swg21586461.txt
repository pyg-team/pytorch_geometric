Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Deploying Sterling Connect:Direct on Windows Vista, 7 and Server 2008 

SYMPTOM
In addition to the Release Notes, this document identifies further information for the deployment of Sterling Connect:Direct for Windows on Microsoft Windows Vista, 7 and Server 2008 with a focus on high impact issues.


CAUSE
In Windows Vista, 7 and Server 2008, the security model has been changed to minimize the need for administrative privileges. The following OS features have some impact to how Sterling Connect:Direct for Windows is managed on these platforms. 

 * User Account Control (UAC) 
 * Run as Administrator (RAA) 
 * File system and registry virtualization

ENVIRONMENT
Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. Installation

Installation of the base version or any patch must be performed by a user with local or domain administrative privileges. Use the RAA method to execute setup.exe. Failure to do so results in an error message


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21586461&amp;aid=1] 
If the server is configured to logon under a user account, it is recommended to disable the UAC feature for the account. This setting is found in the control panel->user account dialog. 

The Log on locally group policy is no longer required. It has been replaced with Deny log on locally, which by default requires no change. 


2. Service Control 

In addition to the CD Admin Tool, the CD Server and MySQL services may be controlled using the Server Manager or Services snap-in available from administrative tools menu. The user is automatically elevated to administrator by these applications. 


3. Executing Tools and Utilities 

Some Sterling Connect:Direct tools and utilities must be started using the RAA method. Failure to do so may result in file system or registry permission related errors or some functionality not working as expected. 

WARNING: In the case of CD Secure+ Admin Tool or CD Secure+ CLI, not using RAA results in per-user data configurations that are NOT recognized by the Sterling Connect:Direct Server. 

The following Sterling Connect:Direct tools and utilities do require the RAA feature  * CD Admin Tool 
 * CD Change Notification Utility 
 * CD Configuration Tool 
 * CD Database Wizard 
 * CD Message Import Utility 
 * CD Message Lookup Utility 
 * CD Secure+ Admin Tool 
 * CD Secure+ CLI 
 * CD System ID Utility


Starting with Sterling Connect:Direct for Windows 4.4.00 Patch 065, the Start menu shortcuts can be modified to automatically start these applications using the RAA method. 
For example, follow these steps to set the CD Admin Tool shortcut to always start using RAA  1. Click on the Windows Start menu button 
 2. Click “All Programs” 
 3. Click “Sterling Commerce Connect Direct v4.4.00” 
 4. Right-click “CD Admin Tool” and select Properties 
 5. On the “Shortcut” tab, click “Advanced” 
 6. In the Advanced Properties, enable the “Run as administrator” checkbox.

The following Sterling Connect:Direct applications do not require the RAA method  * CD Client Connection Utility 
 * CD Requester 
 * CD Command Line Interface 
 * LCU



4. Submitting RUN TASK/JOB 

The run task/job with DESKTOP(YES) feature is not supported on Windows Vista, 7 or Server 2008. The "Interactive Services Detection" service must be running in order for the user to see the below dialog for a RUN TASK/JOB. If this service is stopped, then the user does not get any kind of notification at all and the submitted process hangs.

5. SNMP 

The Sterling Connect:Direct SNMP feature is not supported on 64-bit versions of Windows.
