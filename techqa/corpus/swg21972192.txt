APAR IV79271; IV79271; QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5: Upgrading Unintentionally Removes Backups Older than 7 Days; backups deleted FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 This flash notice advises administrators to an issue where upgrading to QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 causes configuration / data backups older 7 days to be unintentionally removed from the system. 

CONTENT
An investigation is in process to review an upgrade issue in QRadar 7.2.5 patch 5 where configuration and data backs up created by the QRadar Backup and Recovery process are unintentionally deleted when the retention period was set to a value greater than 7 days. To ensure that further customers are not exposed this backup issue, we have temporarily removed QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 from IBM Fix Central to prevent further downloads. 




1. Urgency of this issue: Critical


 * Administrators who have 'Backup Retention Period' configured for more than 7 days and have upgraded to QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 are impacted by this issue and should review the status of their QRadar backups. This deletion issue impacts QRadar appliances with backups that are accessible to QRadar, either backups on the appliance or reachable via external location, such as an NFS mount or iSCSI storage. See the section, 'What to do next', which outlines a tool that will be made available to administrators. 
 * Administrators who have not yet installed QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 are not impacted by the issue. We are advising administrators who have downloaded, but not yet installed QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 to wait for a future update that resolves this issue. 
 * Administrators with a 'Backup Retention Period' configured for less than 7 days and on QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 are not impacted by this issue. 
 * Administrators who have configured tools that manually move or SCP the files off of the appliance are not impacted by this issue, as the QRadar backup process does not have access to these remote locations.



2. Applicable QRadar versions 

This notice only applies to QRadar software version 7.2.5 Patch 5 (7.2.5.20151027201330). 


How do I determine my QRadar version?
To determine if you are running QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5, administrators can review the procedure below. 

 * 
 * Procedure
 *  Log in to the QRadar Console. From the navigation bar, click Help > About. If the version states QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 or Patched to QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 Build 20151027201330, then you should review if you had a configuration backup configured for more than 7 days in the QRadar user interface. 
   
   For example:
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21972192&amp;aid=1] 


3. Relevant information
When the upgrade to QRadar 7.2.5 Patch 5 is in progress, a defect in the template settings forces the Backup Retention Period to 7 days, regardless of the administrator's defined value. The administrator's original Backup Retention Period (days) value is restored, however, not before a service restart deletes the backups that are beyond the 7 day retention value. Any configuration / data backups that are reachable by QRadar either on disk or through remote storage, like NFS or iSCSI will be deleted. 

 

How do I review the backup retention period in QRadar? 

 * 
 * Procedure
 *  Log in to QRadar Console as an administrator. Click the Admin tab. Click the Backup and Recovery icon. Review the value in the Backup Retention Period field.  * If the value is set to 7 days or less, then you are not impacted by this issue. Administrators who have not yet upgraded can subscribe to the following APAR IV79271 [https://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IV79271] to determine when this issue is resolved. Note: The APAR URL might take 24 hours to be visible online. 
    * If the value is set to a number larger than 7, then the administrator should review the status of their backups to verify they have been deleted. For more information, see 'What to do next'.
