APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Following an OutofMemory error on a client, a WXS servers
   threads can become hung under certain circumstances.   When
   this happens the OutOfMemoryError puts the client JVM into a
   state where Reader threads cannot be allocated, or don't
   return.   The WXS server will then get hung with all WXS or
   OGORB threads hung behind one thread dong a socketWrite().

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere eXtreme Scale        *
   *                  Version 7.1.1.0.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: OutOfMemoryError errors on eXtreme      *
   *                      Scale clients can cause the grid to     *
   *                      fail.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   There is a window of time where a thread on the eXtreme Scale
   server can get stuck in a socketWrite() method,
   waiting for work to complete on the client that will never be
   done.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An ORB property, com.ibm.CORBA.SocketWriteTimeout, can
   be used to specify the maximum number of seconds a
   socketWrite() method would remain before timing out.
   Typically, set this value to the same value as the
   requestTimeout value.
