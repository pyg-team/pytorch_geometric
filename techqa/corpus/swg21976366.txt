 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 6 and 7 that are used by WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016 and includes the vulnerability commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0475 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0475]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE Java SE Embedded and Jrockit related to the Libraries component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109946] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0448 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0448]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the JMX component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a partial confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1 

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply an interim fix, according to the table below. Interim fixes are associated with the original APAR that is documented in the table. Because these APAR references might be updated to more recent APARs, see the links in the table for the most recent interim fix information. 

This interim fix contains a new default SSL certificate, as the previous default SSL certificate, which was never intended for production use, has an MD5 signature and is no longer compatible with Java. The result is that installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere Datapower XC10 appliances that are running with an MD5 certificate, including the default SSL certificate that was shipped prior to this interim fix. If the appliance is configured with a custom keystore and certificate with an MD5 signature, it must be replaced prior to upgrading to this interim fix or the 'clear-tls-config' command must be run on the appliance before or after performing the upgrade. Failing to do so will result in the appliance failing to start. Note that changing the active certificate for an appliance collective does require that the cache be reloaded and client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.
