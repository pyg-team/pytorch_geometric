ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SAP role subform error when trying to view the SAP authorization
   roles assigned to a user
   
   
   The error in ITIM trace.log is:
    <Exception><![CDATA[; Line#: 1; Column#: 267
   javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: The reference to
   entity
   "E_2_GB01_HR_MANAGER" must end with the ';' delimiter.
   
   The user has the following SAP authorisation roles:
   Z:ECC6_SAP_EMPLOYEE_ERP|20080604|99991231|
   Z&E_2_GB01_HR_MANAGER|20080604|99991231|
   The subform breaks when it tries to load Z&E_2_GB01_HR_MANAGER.
   I know
   this because when I removed it, the form loads fine.
   Interestingly, the role comes back as Z+E_2_GB01_HR_MANAGER
   under
   supporting data, rather than account data.
   
   Unfortunately the subform load error still occurs when role
   Z&E_2_GB01_HR_MANAGER|20080819|20090819| is present. Appears the
   subform
   does not like the & (ampersand).
   
   .
   
   Customr Recreate: yes
   L2 Support Recreate:  none
   
   Desired Behavior: able to view the SAP authorisation roles
   assigned to
   the user Steps
   Duplicate:view the SAP Authorisation roles
