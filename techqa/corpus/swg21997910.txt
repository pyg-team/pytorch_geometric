Title: IBM SSL errors when trying to create or update resource configuration via Rest API - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using a web browser to access Rest API or another client and when trying to create or update a resource configuration, like a mailbox for example, you are getting a SSL handshake error.


SYMPTOM
- Using regular HTTP port, without SSL, for the connection works fine, you can create and update any resource configuration.
- Using the SSL port, you can login and read any resource configuration, but when trying to create or update a configuration, you get the following error:

Remote host closed connection during handshake



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
- Verify the liberty SIServer logs for error like below:
[1/23/17 15:17:09:705 CET] 00024d07 com.ibm.ws.channel.ssl.internal.SSLHandshakeErrorTracker E CWWKO0801E: Unable to initialize SSL connection. 
Unauthorized access was denied or security settings have expired. Exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol TLSv1 not enabled or not supported

[1/23/17 15:17:09:708 CET] 00026aa5 com.ibm.tenx.db.ui.OperationForm E GORCR9999E: None: Remote host closed connection during handshake
com.ibm.tenx.core.exception.BaseException: Remote host closed connection during handshake

- Check your web browser or the client you are using for the connection and make sure that at least TLSv1.1 or 1.2 is supported.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve the issue, follow the procedure below:

1. Stop IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI).
2. Go to <SI_Install_dir>/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/SIServer
3. Edit the file jvm.options with a text editor
4. Add a new line at the end of the file like below and save the file:
-Dhttps.protocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
5. Restart ISBI

Note: you can disable TLSv1 by removing it from the SSL versions list above, so that it would look like:

-Dhttps.protocols="TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
