PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary:
    PM28202 FOR THE SHORT TEXT ELEMENT FIELD IN WCM AUTHORING UI,
   THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ARE NOT VALIDATED FOR NON-ENGLISH
   
   Detailed Problem Description:
   When a user enters non-english text for example text with French
   Accent characters saving the item can fail with the following
   error:
   
   Error while calling a function createItems of PLS data manager.
   The user is unaware why the save failed.
   
   Problem Analysis:
   French accent characters are more than 1 byte the short text
   field is limited to 250 bytes.  The input field is limited to
   250 characters but when WCM attempts to store the item it fails
   because the field although 250 characters or less is still
   larger than 250 bytes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Solution:
   Code has been added to validate the short text field vale and if
   greater than 250 bytes truncate the text before save and display
   a warning message.
   
   Affected Users:
   All users .
