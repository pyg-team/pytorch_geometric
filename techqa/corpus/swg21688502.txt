QUESTION
 How to reset the Configuration Store in IBM Content Collector 4.0 

CAUSE
Sometimes the configuration store needs to be reset due to database corruption. 

ANSWER
Important: resetting the configuration store will purge all configuration data from the store including active and inactive catalogs. Reset the configuration store only if you have a configuration store backup (XML) or are willing to start configuration from scratch. 

Perform the following steps to reset the configuration store in IBM Content Collector 4.0: 

 1. Shut down all IBM Content Collector services. 
 2. In a command window, navigate to the ContentCollector\ctms directory and execute the following command:
    start /wait SolidDBInstallHelp.exe uninstall "C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore" 
 3. Navigate to the following folder:
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore. 
    This is a hidden folder. If you do not see this folder, modify the folder view options to display hidden files. 
 4. Rename C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solid.db to solid.db.old 
 5. Delete all files under this folder but do not delete the folder:  * C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\logs
    
    
 6. Other log files in the C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore directory may also be deleted. But do not delete the following files:  * C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solid.ini 
     * C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solid.lic
       
    
    
 7. In the command window, navigate to the ContentCollector\ctms directory and execute the following command: 
    start /wait SolidDBInstallHelp.exe install "C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore" 
 8. Start the IBM Content Collector Configuration Access service which will in turn start the following services: 
    IBM Content Collector Configuration Store 
    IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Manager 
 9. Start Configuration Manager and you will now have an empty configuration store to work with. If you have previously exported your catalog, you may import it here.
