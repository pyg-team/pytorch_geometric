PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When performing recognition on an image, recognition fails. The RRS log entry shows:

Word too tall, removed. 

CAUSE
This error can occur when the height of the word in pixels exceeds the configured limit. It can also occur when the recognition engine cannot identify the boundaries of the word.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do one of the following as appropriate for the situation. 

 * Verify that the newest recognition engine is being used. Currently this is done using the RecognizePageOCR_S action from the ocr_sr library. 
 * Increase the height limit for the action using SetMaxCharacterHeightTMM(x) where x represents the height in pixels. Default depends on the DPI, but for 300 DPI is 64. 
 * Reduce the height of the word in pixels. This may be done either by making the word smaller, or by reducing the number of pixels per inch for the tiff.
