APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer has a project running with 75 steps so that, when t
   hey are viewing the running job with auto-paginate off (as in, '
   display all'), only half of the steps are visible on the screen.
     When they scroll down to look at the last steps, the page keep
   s auto-refreshing and losing their scroll position putting them
   back at the top of the page.  I'm using IE  7.0 on Windows also
   reproducible in FireFox and Google Chrome.  Seriously annoying.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The loading process of the main listing needed splitting up
   into chunks of processing in order to keep Internet Explorer
   from locking up on lengthy listings. This kept the browser
   from properly remembering the scroll position of the
   listing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We now keep track of the scroll position and apply it upon
   rendering of the full listing.
