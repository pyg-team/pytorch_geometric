APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
     Windows any version. Upgrade from SAP 6.2.0 agent to 7.1.0
   agent.
   Problem Description:
     After the SAP 6.2.0 agent is installed, when the instance is
   created
     a section [System information] is created in the ENV instance
   file.
     This section is not supported by Basic Services or by any
   installer.
     The invalid information causes the installer to abort when an
   upgrade
     is attempted..
   
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Install and configure TEMS and TEPS for agents to report
   to.
     2. Install SAP 620 and configure instance to report to TEMS
   created
        in step 1.
     3. Install ITM 6.2.3 FP1 NT agent and configure to report to
   TEMS
        created in step 1.
     4. Install SAP 710 to upgrade SAP agent installed in step 2.
        See popup that states: Unable to install IBM Tivoli
   Composite
        Application Manager Agent for SAP support packages required
   for
        self-describing mode. Check installation log file for more
   details.
   
   
     NOTE: The agent should install. There is an unsupported
   section
     [System Information] in the ENV file. This object is not
   supported by
     any installer and is also not supported by Basic Services.
   
   
   Local Fix:
     Before upgrade review the KSAENV file and KSAENV_instance_name
   and
     remove any [System Information] section or any other [section]
   in the
     ENV file. Then install the SAV710 agent. The install will run
   to
     completion.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
