Title: IBM How to enable RCP Trace for Cognos Insight - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This TechNote will explain how you can enable the RCP Trace for Cognos Insight.

This Trace can be activated in addition to the Provagent Trace outlined in the documentation of Insight to gather debug information. 

CAUSE
Provagent Trace might not show the required information for support to analyze the call further.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 7 / XP SP3 with Cognos Insight Installation

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Under Windows 7:
Create a backup of :
C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Roaming\IBM\Cognos Insight\cognosrcp.ini
Open cognosrcp.ini in an editor of your choice
remove the leading ; 
in the ";log=log.txt" line
so it turns into log=rcplog.txt
and change 
log.level=none to log.level=debug

Start Cognos Insight and the rcplog.txt file will be written to your desktop.
You can replace rcplog.txt with another path like c:\logs\rcplogs.txt the folder in this case logs however must exist, also you cannot write the log into a root folder of a harddisk like c:\rcplogs.txt

After you have traced the behavior in question, stop IBM Cognos Insight and replace the modified file with the copy you took in the beginning.

Under Windows XP:

Create a backup of :
C:\Program Files\IBM\Cognos Insight\cognosrcp.ini
Open cognosrcp.ini in an editor of your choice
remove the leading ; 
in the ";log=log.txt" line
so it turns into log=rcplog.txt
and change 
log.level=none to log.level=debug

Start Cognos Insight and the rcplog.txt file will be written to your desktop.
You can replace rcplog.txt with another path like c:\logs\rcplogs.txt the folder in this case logs however must exist, also you cannot write the log into a root folder of a harddisk like c:\rcplogs.txt

After you have traced the behavior in question, stop IBM Cognos Insight and replace the modified file with the copy you took in the beginning.
