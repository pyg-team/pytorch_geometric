ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BFGDB0003E exception is seen when running the WMQ FTE database
   logger against DB2 z/OS when using DB2 Connect:
   
   BFGDB0003E: A problem occurred with the database. The database
   driver reported the following details: SQL State &#65517;42704&#65529;, Error
   Code &#65517;-204&#65529;,
   Message &#65517;DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-204, SQLSTATE=42704,
   SQLERRMC=FTELOG.CALL, DRIVER=3.61.75&#65529;
   &#65517;com.ibm.wmqfte.databaselogger.exceptions.DataStoreException&#65529;
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition standalone
   database logger uses DB2 Connect to connect to DB2 on z/OS, the
   currentSchema is not flown to the DB2 server due to a limitation
   of DB2 Connect when WebSphere MQ Server is used as the
   transaction coordinator.
   
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the standalone database logger connecting to DB2 on
   z/OS.
   
   PLATFORMS AFFECTED:
   All except z/OS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been modified to flow the currentSchema setting on
   each transaction when the database logger is running on a
   non z/OS platform and the database being used is DB2 z/OS.
