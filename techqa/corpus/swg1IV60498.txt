APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   
   Common behavior of the UNIX and Linux OS Agents, for all the
   attributes defined as Unicode strings and in any attribute
   groups, is to return an empty value if the string cannot be
   converted to UTF-8. This is correct but does not handle the
   case where the conversion has failed just because the converted
   string does not fit in the fixed length of the attribute.  This
   APAR is going to change such behavior in a way that truncated
   Unicode strings will be provided in such cases, instead of empty
   strings.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   
   This issue affects all the UNIX and Linux OS agents, at any
   versions.
   
   Diagnostics:
   
   KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:kux ALL) (UNIT:utf8 ALL) (UNIT:nls2 ALL)
   
   
   Example:
   
   Look for messages like "Error converting <attribute name> to
   UTF8; no conversion occurred."
   
   Initial Impact:
   
   Medium, Unicode attributes unusable if their converted value
   length exceeds their defined limit.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Empty unicode attributes when the value exceeds the attribute
   length.
   
   
   The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS does not apply truncation in
   case the conversion from the native string to UTF-8 encoding
   fails due to a buffer overflow. As a result the unicode
   attribute is filled with blanks.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed this behavior for all of the unicode attributes. They
   get now truncated and the trailing '...' string appended, if the
    converted string does not fit.
