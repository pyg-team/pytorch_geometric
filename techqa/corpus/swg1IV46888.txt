APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has defined two provisioning policies for the same
   service as follows:-
   1) Policy 1 -: Automatic entitlement, No entitlement workflow,
                  Priority: 50, Membership: Role 1.
   2) Policy 2 -: Manual entitlement, With entitlement workflow,
                  Priority:100, Membership: Role 2.
   
   Both the provisioning policies have three common entitlement
   parameters but with different values.  When a user is modified
   to have Role 1 and Role 2, policy enforcement takes place and
   approval (entitlement workflow) from the manual provisioning
   policy (i.e.  Policy 2) gets executed even though "Policy 1"
   takes precedence.
   
   Customer complaints that since "Policy 1" takes precedence,
   entitlement workflow from "Policy 2" should not be invoked.
   
   Steps to duplicate:
   
   1. Create two provisioning policies as follows
      Policy 1 -: Automatic entitlement, No entitlement
                  workflow, Priority: 50, Membership: Role 1.
      Policy 2 -: Manual entitlement, With entitlement workflow,
                  Priority:100, Membership: Role 2.
   2. Add some common entitlement parameters for both the policies
      but with different values.
   3. Modify any user to have Role 1 and Role 2.
   4. You can see that approval (entitlement workflow) from the
      manual provisioning policy (i.e. Policy 2) gets executed even
      though "Policy 1" takes precedence. The values enforced are
      from policy 1 but the system executes approval from policy 2.
   
   Desired Behavior:
   ITIM should not execute an entitlement workflow from a
   provisioning policy that has lower priority.
