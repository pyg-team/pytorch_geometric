ABSTRACT
 Level 2 Support expert Marla Morris and members of the IBM License Metric Tool team shared information on "No Scan Data."

"No Scan Data" is an issue commonly reported by ILMT customers, particularly during the initial stages of launching and testing the IBM License Metric Tool. This session explained how Scan Data is captured, and how to troubleshoot and resolve issues where "No Scan Data" is reported by ILMT. After the presentation, we opened the call to take questions from the audience. Throughout the event, attendees commented and asked questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting Web chat. This was an educational, lively session.
