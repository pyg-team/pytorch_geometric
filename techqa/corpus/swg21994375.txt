Title: IBM Security Bulletin:  IBM® DB2® LUW is vulnerable to Sweet32 Birthday Attack (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM DB2 for SSL support. The GSKit that is shipped with IBM DB2 is vulnerable to the Sweet32 Birthday attack. By default, DB2 does not use SSL for client-server communication and therefore DB2 is vulnerable only if SSL is enabled and a Triple-DES cipher is selected. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL and GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Release Fix pack APAR V9.7 TBD IT17531 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17531] V10.1 FP6 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043366] IT17645 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17645] V10.5 FP9 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044110] IT17646 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17646] V11.1.2 FP2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043789] IT17647 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17647] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The database manager configuration parameter SSL_CIPHERSPECS specifies the cipher suites that the server allows for incoming connection requests when using SSL protocol. The following are the Triple-DES ciphers allowed by the server:

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

If the SSL_CIPHERSPECS parameter have one or more of the above Triple-DES ciphers and no other ciphers then corrective action need to be taken. To prevent a Triple-DES cipher from being used by the server, choose one or more ciphers allowed that is not a Triple-DES cipher. The list of allowed ciphers can be found in the DB2 Knowledge Cente [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.config.doc/doc/r0053617.html]r.
