APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We have three DAT discovery exports that completed with errors.
   Clicking on the failed objects link in the dataserver UI does
   not display any results. Attempted to re-export with the same
   results. We would like to know if the errors are valid, and if
   yes, why are they not showing up in the UI

   indexing errors caused by an issue in previous release, but not
   able to determine that for sure.
