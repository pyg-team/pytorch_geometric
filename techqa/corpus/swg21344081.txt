QUESTION
 In Cognos Connection, Report Studio, Report Viewer and the Cognos System use Prompt Pages to interact with the Client. 
Can the SDK which is not a browser , render report prompt pages in the same manner as in done in Cognos Connection, the Studio's and Cognos Viewer ? 

ANSWER
Answer for Cognos ReportNet (CRN) :
The SDK is unable to render mandatory prompt pages, unless software for the SDK is designed to do so , with programmed Screens or Panels.

When a report with prompts is executed using the normal SDK, the same prompting is accessed as the one seen in the Report Studio interactively, done by the Report Service. 
However the actual prompt page can not be "displayed" within the SDK, since there is no Web based session within the SDK , capable of displaying any pages generated by the Report Service. 

If you would like to see the actual prompt page in CRN, the report can be executed from an URL instead of the SDK. That way there is the Webserver User Session for the Browser to handle the prompt pages.

Updated Answer for IBM Cognos Business Analytics version 8 and 10

In Cognos BA the way how mandatory prompts are handled was changed, and methods were added to the SDK API to step through prompt pages when running a report.

Check in the IBM Cognos SDK Developer Guide for the promptPaging Method Set.
There are methods that do :
forward and back( conversation, parameterValues, options)
getPromptValues(conversation, parameterValues, options)

Note that getPromptValues() also applies in C10.1.x and above for the PowerPlay Service methods.

NOTE : The getPromptValues method from earlier versions was obsoleted and removed / replaced with the same method name in the 10.2.1 Version and above of IBM Cognos. Ensure that your development environment uses the latest method.
