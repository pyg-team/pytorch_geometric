QUESTION
 How to manually install the Datacap Web controls on a client machine with IBM Datacap. 

CAUSE
Datacap Web installs to clients various controls for certain functionality such as interfacing with scanners. These controls are normally downloaded and installed automatically when accessing the website with proper browser settings and user permissions. However, there may be cases due to corporate security / user environment where manual installation may be desirable or required.

ANSWER
All Datacap Web clients 

 1. Login to the end user's machine with an account that has rights to install and register files. 
 2. Make \Datacap\tmweb.net\Task\dcim.cab from the Datacap Web server available on the end user's machine. 
 3. Extract the contents of dcim.cab into a new folder. 
 4. Copy all extracted files into the %windir%\SysWOW64 folder. 
    This is typically C:\Windows\SysWOW64
    Note: For this step and all subsequent steps, if installing to a 32 bit (x86) system, replace SysWOW64 with system32 in all paths. 
 5. Right-click and run Command Prompt with the Run as Administrator option if User Account Control (UAC) is enabled. 
 6. Execute the following commands, adjusting paths as necessary:  * regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\DcEdit.ocx 
     * regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dcimage.ocx 
     * regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dcthumbs.ocx 
     * regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dcsimage.ocx
    
    

Datacap Web scan stations 

In addition to the above, Datacap Web scan stations require the following: 

 1. Make \Datacap\tmweb.net\Task\dctwx.cab from the Datacap Web server available on the end user's machine. 
 2. Extract the contents of dctwx.cab into a new folder. 
 3. Copy all extracted files into the %windir%\SysWOW64 folder. 
 4. Right-click and run Command Prompt with the Run as Administrator option if User Account Control (UAC) is enabled. 
 5. Execute the following commands, adjusting paths as necessary:
    regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dcstwx.ocx
    regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Accusoft.TwainPro7.ActiveX.dll
