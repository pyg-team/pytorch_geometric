APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Authorization to read or manipulate BPEL process data can be
   granted either by using process instance-based authorization
   roles (such as reader, editor, potential owner, owner,
   administrator) or by assigning users or groups to the
   BPESystemAdministrator or BPESystemMonitor Java EE roles. Users
   or groups in the BPESystemMonitor role are not correctly checked
   to determine if they are authorized to perform actions on
   processes or activity instances.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Because the BPESystemMonitor Java EE role is not being honored,
   users in this role are not granted correct permissions on
   process instances.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 that adds the check for
   the BPESystemMonitor role.
