QUESTION
 Does the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance have the ability to perform certificate revocation checks? 

ANSWER
DataPower currently provides two ways to check if a certificate has been revoked: 

 * Using an OCSP extension function 
 * Using a CRL configuration object


Using an OCSP extension function 
The following DataPower extension functions can be used together to perform online certificate status (OCSP) checks: 


Function Details dp:ocsp-validate-certificate() Makes an OCSP request to an OCSP server, validates the server response, and returns an XML representation of the response. dp:ocsp-validate-response() Validates an OCSP server response, previously obtained by dp:ocsp-validate-certificate(), and returns an XML representation of the response. 

More information about these functions can be found in the Extensions-Common Guide. 

Using a CRL configuration object 
If using an OCSP extension function is not appropriate, another alternative is to create a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Retrieval object. 

For information about the CRL Retrieval object, review the " Working with CRL Retrieval objects" section of the WebGUI documentation.
