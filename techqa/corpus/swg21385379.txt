ABSTRACT
 APAR PK83534 allows the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 Service Flow Runtime (SFR) Feature to run on CICS TS V3.1. This means that if you are running CICS TS V3.1, you will be able to use all the features of the V3.2 runtime. However to use these features some migration steps will be necessary. 

CONTENT
Following are the steps that are necessary if you would like to run the CICS TS V3.2 SFR on CICS TS V3.1: 

 1. Download the SFR for CICS TS V3.2 by following the instructions under "Order Service Flow Feature" in the document entitled CICS Service Flow Feature - ordering and usage information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21286558]. 
    
    
 2. Download Rational Application Developer for z [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rdz/] V7.1 (RDz) by following the instructions under "Installing Rational Developer for System z V7.1" in that same document referenced in step 1. There is also a section in this document that tells you how to get a promotional copy of RDz V7.1.
    
    
    
 3. Install the SFR by following the instructions in the CICS TS V3.2 information center under Installing the CICS Service Flow Runtime [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMGV_3.2.0/com.ibm.cics.sfr.doc/topics/installingciaz.html]. These instructions refer to the CICS Service Flow Runtime Program Directory that you will receive when you order the SFR. 
    
    
    
 4. Apply CICS TS V3.1 PTF UK46422 for APAR PK83534 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK83534]. This will remove some code from the SFR V3.2 entry stub module DFHMADPL that prevents SFR V3.2 from running on CICS TS V3.1.
    
    
    
 5. Migrate your existing CICS TS Service Flow Feature V3.1 service flows as the two runtimes are incompatible. To migrate your flows, you will need to regenerate them again through the Service Flow Modeller tooling provided in RDz [http://www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rdz/].
    
    Create a new generation properties file for each flow that you wish to migrate:  1. During the create new generation properties file wizard, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to deploy for CICS TS V3.1 or V3.2. You will need to select CICS TS V3.2 to ensure that the correct deployable entities are created for the new level of the runtime. 
     2. Fill in the generation properties file. You might want to use your existing generation properties file as a template to help you fill in the details. Once complete, you can generate the flow.
    
    


Note some of the generated assets have changed. CICS TS V3.2 no longer requires a properties file update job and a CSD update JCL to be created. Both of these assets are now replaced with a service flow properties file that is deployed into UNIX System Services (USS). For more information please see the Enhancements to deploying and managing service flows [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMGV_3.2.0/com.ibm.cics.sfr.doc/topics/dfhcr_flowmgmt_changes.html] in the CICS TS V3.2 information center. 

It is possible that generation of an existing flow might create fewer COBOL source code modules than when the flow was generated using the V3.1 level of runtime. In this release, CICS has carried out a refactoring exercise that has allowed more code to be placed into the runtime. This means that your generated flows are easier to manage and deploy.
