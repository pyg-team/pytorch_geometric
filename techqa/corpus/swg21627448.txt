Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Collector (ICC) mail connector trace logs and blacklist contain failures with an exception referencing Lotus Notes API error code 2055: "The server is not responding. The server may be down or you may be experiencing network problems. Contact your system administrator if this problem persists." 

SYMPTOM
When running an ICC Task Route with a Lotus Domino Connector, there are error messages in the ICC mail connector trace logs and blacklist as follows (time stamps and system specific data removed):

WARNING [3745] AFUP0026E Could not stub
message com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.domino.DominoMessage@ to the
following stubbing state STUB_DELETE. Error message:AFUL0024E: A Lotus
Notes API error occurred: 2055 (2055: "The server is not responding.
The server may be down or you may be experiencing network problems.
Contact your system administrator if this problem persists.") [Resource
(Server/Database/UNID)::
] ("LNNote::noteDelete")


CAUSE
Archiving of mails from Domino failed as the message could not be retrieved from the source mailbox. This failure is due to an outage of the Domino Server.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector for Lotus Domino

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Investigate if there was a Lotus Domino crash that coincided with the black list and error log entries. Ensure that the Lotus Domino server is brought back up via a restart and archival should begin working as expected.
