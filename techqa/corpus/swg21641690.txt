PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What are the main goals achieved by the 7.2.1 TADDM FixPack 4 ? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Functionality of 7.2.1-TADDM-FP04 

This part is something that runs during the install /migration 

 
New alias recalculation tool 
The new version addresses these issues by: 
– Skipping calculation of redundant aliases that are not used in 
reconciliation process 
– Analyzing data dependencies in the database to process data in the 
most optimal order 
– Optimized algorithm of data processing 

Alias regeneration process consists of the following steps: 
– Database statistics are gathered for optimal query performance 
– Analyze existing data – count number of objects and number of 
dependent objects for each CDM class 
– Set optimal processing order for all classes (skip classes without 
objects) – as a result each customer can have different processing order
(different list of classes to process, ordered differently) 
– Remove all existing aliases (either loaded by earlier migration or 
generated by the cross alias tool) 
– Calculate aliases based on master aliases for all model objects 
(ignore CMDB_GUID_ALIAS table – no alias is copied from this table now) 
– After installation remove objects reported as corrupted using data 
verification tools (manually) and ObjectsWithoutAliasesCleanupAgent 
(automatically) 


These are the new sensors that are provided with 7.2.1-TADDM-FP04: 
Discovery over ITM 6.3 – IV30895 
Support for discovery of Cisco works 4.1 
ExtremeVlanSensor 
(create relationship between port and vlan for Extreme switches) 
Support for DB2 10 
Support for Windows 2012 
no Cygwin 
requires .NET 3.5 


New topo functionality was also added: 
Topology Builder log agents: 
Collation property: com.ibm.cdb.topobuilder.SplitAgentLog=true 
New directory will be created: TADDM_HOME/dist/log/agents 
Every agent will log now into two logs: TopologyBuilder.log (as it is 
now) and into <agent-name>.log in new directory 
Engine will log in agent's log START header/STOP footer. 
Logging will dynamically react to changing logging levels. 


Another addition, security fixes: 
Logon to Data Management Portal with LTPAToken (SSO) 
Security fixes: 
SHA2 certificates using stronger algorithm 
WEB UI security issues (e.g. cross-site scripting) 
new Java SR15
