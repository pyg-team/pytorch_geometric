 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Edit Report action from the Report Viewer widget is not functional when using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 9 or later. An alternative approach to editing a report must be used instead. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following options can be used to edit a report: 

 * Launch the IBM Cognos Connection tool from the Start Menu on Microsoft Windows. Select Start->Programs->IBM->Business Monitor->Profiles->(profile name)->IBM Cognos Connection. 
 * Launch this tool from the Report Designer widget within the dashboards by clicking on the Advanced Authoring... link. 
 * Point your browser directly at the IBM Cognos Connection URL: http://host:port/p2pd/servlet/dispatch/ext, as in http://localhost:9080/p2pd/servlet/dispatch/ext.


From within the IBM Cognos Connection tool, select Launch->Report Studio, load the report, edit it as necessary, and click Save. The next time you load your dashboard with the Report Viewer widget, it will display the edited version of the report.
