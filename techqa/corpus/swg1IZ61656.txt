APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You cannot work with a message that contains a xs:anytype
   element with
   hexBinary content in the BPC Explorer. For example, if you want
   to
   restart an activity whose input message has such a structure,
   you are
   not able to fix the message with the BPC Explorer.
   The problem is due to the fact that BPC Explorer first shows a
   form view
   that distorts the hexBinary value. If the user switches to the
   source
   view, the distorted values from the forms view are still shown.
   The fix will make sure that the user can switch to the source
   view and
   fix the message there.
