APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: N/A
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   Object heap might be not allocated in Large Pages requested by
   -Xlp option if provided -Xmx value is not aligned to LP size.
   The taken physical page size can be checked in GC verbose
   log:This is example of aligned -Xmx value: 3G heap is requested
   and it is allocated in 1G LP:./java -Xlp -Xaggressive
   -Xcompressedrefs -Xmx3072m -verbose:gc -version 2>&1 <PIPE>
   egrep "RefsShift<PIPE>pageSize"<attribute
   name="compressedRefsShift" value="0x3" /><attribute
   name="pageSize" value="0x40000000" />This is example of not
   aligned -Xmx value. Memory is taken in 4K pages:./java -Xlp
   -Xaggressive -Xcompressedrefs -Xmx3071m -verbose:gc -version
   2>&1 <PIPE> egrep "RefsShift<PIPE>pageSize"<attribute
   name="compressedRefsShift" value="0x3" /><attribute
   name="pageSize" value="0x1000" />
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use -Xmx value aligned to requested LP sizeTo get information
   about available LP sizes use -verbose:sizes
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If Object Heap allocation is requested in Large Pages by using
   -Xlp option but provided -Xmx value is not aligned to desired LP
   size an allocation in LP can be refused and memory is taken in
   small pages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR will be fixed in the following Java Releases:
      7 R1 SR1       (7.1.1.0)
   .
   Memory allocation request does rounding up for -Xmx value to
   desired LP size
