   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A CICS signon fails with message        *
   *                      DFHUS0002 A severe error (code X'0309') *
   *                      has occurred in module DFHUSAD.         *

   ****************************************************************
   A CICS signon drives DFHUSAD add_user processing. The userid
   already exists in the user directory, and DFHXSPW and DFHXSSB
   are called in turn to action the request. DFHXSSB issues an
   INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA call which returns exception with reason
   APPLID_NOTAUTH, as the userid is not authorized to the CICS
   application. Message ICH408I is issued to report the error.
   The xssb_applid_notauth condition is passed back as
   xspw_applid_notauth. However DFHUSAD does not recognize
   xspw_applid_notauth and sets usad_response to usad_disaster. A
   system dump, message DFHUS0002 and *EXC trace result.
   .
   US 0309 USAD  *EXC* Exception-unknown
   .
   The CICS signon fails with message DFHUS0002 A severe error
   (code X'0309') has occurred in module DFHUSAD.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHUSAD has been changed to correctly handle the
   xspw_applid_notauth condition.
