Title: IBM Configure probe to receive undefined SNMP traps from HP NNMi - United States

Text:
unrecognized; unmanaged; stray TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I configure the probe for HP NNMi version 8/9 to collect and process undefined SNMP traps? 

CAUSE
Customer enabled the following properties in HP NNMi to collect undefined SNMP traps:

com.hp.nnm.events.allowUndefinedTraps=true 
com.hp.nnm.events.undefinedTrapSeverity=NORMAL
com.hp.nnm.events.undefinedTrapsNature=INFO 

ANSWER
Undefined SNMP traps cannot be configured as incidents in HP NNMi. Since the probe relies on defined incidents to generate events, undefined SNMP traps cannot be propagated to the ObjectServer by the probe.
