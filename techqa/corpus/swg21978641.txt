Title: IBM EIF probe not receiving itm events - United States

Text:
om_tec.conf eif probe itm event clearing omnibus TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM is sending events to EIF probe which is then forwarded to the OMNIbus Server. Client is observing that the clearing event is sent per the ITM trace/log but the event does not seem to be received into EIF or OMNIbus as the triggered event is still seen in OMNIbus.



SYMPTOM
Situation in ITM is no longer true but event is not cleared in OMNIbus.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The iptrace shows that the EIF probe on the OMNIbus side is resetting/closing(<RST>) the TCP/IP connection after it receives the event and it never shows up in the EIF logs, so the event is just dropped.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to set the connection_mode in your om_tec.config on the ITM Server (TEMS) to use 


connection_less 

instead of 

connection oriented.

That is, change this line in your om_tec.config

ConnectionMode=co
to
ConnectionMode=connection_less

You will need to restart the EIF on your ITM. (tacmd refreshTECinfo -t eif)
