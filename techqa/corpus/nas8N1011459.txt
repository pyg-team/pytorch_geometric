 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Installing the IBM Installation Manager 
   
   To install from a live repository requires IM 1.6.0 or later. It can be downloaded from the following URL:
   
   http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Downloads/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager# [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Downloads/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager#]
   
   Expand the zip file into a directory in the IFS.
   
   The Installation Manager can be installed using one of the following methods:
   
   
   HTTP Web Administration Installation:
   
   NOTE: For this method to work properly the HTTP group PTF (V7R1 - SF99368, V6R1- SF99115) needs to be at the most current level. See the following URL for the current levels available:
   
   http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs [http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs]
   
   A) Open a web browser and go to the following URL (replace systemname with your IBM i system name or IP address):
   
   http://systemname:2001/HTTPAdmin
   
   B) Click on the 'Manage' Tab at the top and then click on the 'Installations' tab underneath.
   
   C) You should see a screen that looks similar to the following:
   
   This image shows the manage installations screen and highlights the install button. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=1]
   
   D) Click the 'Install' button.
   
   E) You then should see a screen similar to the following that prompts for the Installation Manager package location:
   
   This image shows the screen where you enter the install location of the IM imstall code. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=2]
   F) Type the location where the installation manager zip file was expanded and click Next.
   
   G) You should see a screen similar to the following (NOTE: In the screen below the location where Installation Manager was expanded was '/home/rklarsen/im'
   
   
   This image shows the icon that is displayed while the install process is running. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011459&aid=3]
   
   
   IBM i Command Line installation:
   
   Run these commands to start the installation:
   
   o STRQSH
   o cd /<IM_installfiles_dir>
   o umask 022
   o installc -acceptLicense -log /was8/imlog.log
   
   Note: In the example commands above, /was8/IM is the directory where the install files were expanded.
   
   
   


 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Installing the WebSphere Application Server v8.0 Product 
   
   To access the Passport Advantage live repository, you must have a valid user ID and password. Those credentials must be stored in a secure storage file so they can be used during the installation. If you want to verify your PA credentials, you can go to the following URL: 
   
   https://www-912.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80/repository.xml [https://www-912.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80/repository.xml]
   
   It should prompt for user ID and password. If the logon is successful, the XML file will be displayed.
   
   Important Note: To continue, you must know which edition of WebSphere Application Server 8.0 you are trying to install. The edition is represented by the "offering ID"
   
   Here is a list of the offering IDs: 
   
   com.ibm.websphere.BASE.v80 = Base com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80 = ND com.ibm.websphere.APPCLIENT.v80 = Application Client com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v80 = Express from ISO or 5722-WE2 DVD com.ibm.websphere.EXPRESS.v80 = Express from Passport Advantage 
   The live service repositories also contain the offering ID. These URLs are based on the following pattern: 
   
   http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/]<offering_ID> 
   NOTE: This URL will be used in the commands to create your secure storage file and install the WAS product. 
   
   There are two install methods that we can use to install the product: 
   
   1) Use the IBM Web Administration for i GUI  * 
    * 
    * 
    * http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibmi/library/i-webSphere_spplication_server_installation/index.html
   
   
   or 
   
   2) We can use native Installation Manager commands via the IBM i command line. 
   To use the command line method we need to do the following: 
    * a) Create a secure credential storage file
