Title: IBM Unable to get email Listener to work with SSL - United States

Text:
TPAEEL TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am able to use IMAP without SSL and it works fine so we know the account and destination
address are working. However, the organization standard is SSL 

CAUSE
The error is: 
javax.mail.MessagingException: Server chose SSLv3, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.;nested exception is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Server chose SSLv3, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.


ANSWER
Add the following property & value via the Maximo System Properties application. A reboot of the MXServer instance will likely be required as this is a JVM level JavaMail property. 


property: mail.imaps.ssl.protocols
value: SSLv3
