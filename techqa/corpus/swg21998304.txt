PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed a Guardium STAP agent and want to configure inspection engine for the Oracle database. However, I can't see Oracle as an option in the DB_TYPE while creating an inspection engine on collector GUI under Manage > Activity Monitoring > S-TAP Control 

CAUSE
You do not have proper licenses installed.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Execute command show license as user CLI on the collector. If the license keys are properly installed, you should see Parser ORACLE listed. If you can't see it in the list, you won't be able to configure an inspection engine for Oracle database. 

e.g. Following is an example from a managed appliance that has one of the licenses installed as Guardium Advanced Monitoring License :

Before proceeding further, you should be aware of the license keys you need to set up. Click here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21973263] to know more.
