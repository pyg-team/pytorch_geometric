Title: IBM Using the "911" tool to troubleshoot FileNet P8 Process Engine (PE) and Image Services (IS) issues. - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I use the "911" tool to troubleshoot FileNet P8 Process Engine (PE) and Image Services (IS) issues? 

CAUSE
911 is an Image Services-based script, available on FileNet P8 PE and IS servers, that takes a snapshot of the server by running a set of system tools, quickly capturing a cross-section of some key server metrics. (Note: Some earlier versions of PE did not include the 911 script. If you do not find 911 on your PE server, contact IBM FileNet Support.)

ANSWER
The 911 script is normally located in the /fnsw/support directory (\fnsw\support on Windows). To run the script, enter 911 at the command prompt:

911

911 displays its progress on the screen as it runs. For example:

Upon completing successfully, the 911 script collects the generated logs and configuration files and then either tars and compresses or zips them, depending on your platform, into one file. If necessary, this file can then be easily sent to IBM Support for analysis:


911.YYYYMMDD.##.tar.Z on UNIX in /fnsw/local/logs/911 911.YYYYMMDD.##.zip on Windows in \fnsw_loc\logs\911

where ## is the 911 run iteration number.

By default, the collected files have the following naming convention: 

<tool _name>.<yyymmdd>.<##>.

Using a text editor, you can view each generated report file to help you resolve any problems detected.

911 should be run when the server begins to show symptoms of the problem or issue. Run 911 more than once if, after the first run, the server continues to show signs of the issue. 

Occasionally, the 911 script hangs due to an issue encountered while running one of its component tools. When this happens be sure to check where, or at which tool, the problem occurred by looking in the 911.YYYYMMDD.## output file. Then, if possible, attempt to run the component tools individually, or manually, as described in the "Collecting data" technotes referenced in For more information below.


Data to collect if uploading to an IBM Support PMR: All files in the /fnsw/local/logs/911 (or \fnsw_loc\logs\911) directory reflecting the current dayâ€™s date. Additionally, as applicable, all the files you created in /fnsw/local/tmp (or \fnsw_loc\tmp) when you ran the component tools manually. Include a description of any known circumstances leading up to the issue along with any other server error logs. Also document the time at which the issue occurred.

For more information: Depending on your operation system platform, please see one of these technotes for more information on the 911 tool, including how to run the component tools manually, and the files and logs to collect to facilitate troubleshooting efforts:
