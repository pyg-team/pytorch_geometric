QUESTION
 I want to forward events from IBM Tivoli Monitoring to OMNIbus, is there a best practice for forwarding event information? 

ANSWER
The ITM Installation and Setup Guide documents the process for setting up event forwarding from ITM to OMNIbus through the Tivoli EIF probe. Optionally, OMNIbus can send back updates to ITM on events which originated from ITM through the Situation Update Forwarder. See the ITM Installation and Setup Guide for your installed ITM version. The ITM 6.3 event forwarding documentation is available at
