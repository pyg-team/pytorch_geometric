AFFECTED PLATFORMS: 
IBM Notes 8.5.x


REMEDIATION: 

Fix:
This issue is being tracked as SPR# KLYH8UDNXD and is fixed in the base code of Notes 9.0. The fix will also be included in 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4. Refer to the Notes & Domino Fix List [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/Progress/$first?opendocument] to monitor availability of 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4. 

Workaround: 
None 

Mitigation:
None 







VULNERABILITY DETAILS: 

CVE ID: CVE-2012-6349 

DESCRIPTION: 
IBM Notes buffer overflow in the Autonomy KeyView File Parser for .mdb files. This vulnerability could lead to remote code execution. 

CVSS: 
CVSS Base Score: 9.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/80669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/80669] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) 

AFFECTED PLATFORMS: 
IBM Notes 8.5.1.x, 8.5.2.x, 8.5.3.x. 
REMEDIATION: 

Fix:

This issue is being tracked as SPR# KLYH92XL3W and is fixed in the base code of Notes 9.0. The fix will also be included in 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4. Refer to the Notes & Domino Fix List [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/Progress/$first?opendocument] to monitor availability of 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4. 


Workaround: 
Delete or rename the keyview.ini file in the Notes program directory. 
This disables ALL viewers. When a user clicks View (for any file attachment), a dialog box will display with the message "Unable to locate the viewer configuration file."

Delete or rename the affected DLL file.
After removing the dll file, when a user tries to view a file that requires that viewer, a dialog box will display with the message "The viewer display window could not be initialized." All other file types work without returning the error message. 

Comment out line in keyview.ini to remove the association with .mbd
To comment a line, you precede it with a semi-colon (;). When a user tries to view the specific file type, a dialog box will display with the message "There is no viewer filter available for this file. Would you like to try to open the file? To protect your computer from malicious files, do not open a file unless you trust the source. If you aren't sure, view the file or save it to your computer and scan it with an antivirus program before opening.".

Example:
;263=wkb 0 kvwkbve.dll ; MSAccess presented as a spreadsheet ---> this would be the result of removing the association

Mitigation:
None
