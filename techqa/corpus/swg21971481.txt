Title: IBM Accessing the Process Inspector results in the error "javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match" - United States

Text:
javax.net.ssl.SSLException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to use the Process Inspector from the IBM Cloud Orchestrator Business Process Manager (BPM) Process Portal results in the error "The attempt to establish a secure connection to the server has failed." 

SYMPTOM
Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Login to BPM Process Admin Console 
 2. Select Process Inspector


The following error is seen in the BPM SystemOut.log: 

[10/6/15 11:34:13:628 EDT] 0001273e ProcessAdminR E The attempt to establish a secure connection to the server has failed. See <ahref="../../../BPMHelp/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/troubleshooting_hostname_failure.html" target="_blank">SSL fails when host name configuration fails</a> for details. 
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <back_end_hostname> != <front_end_hostname.ibm.com> OR <front_end_hostname.ibm.com> 
CAUSE
This issue can be seen if you have two interfaces for IBM Cloud Orchestrator servers such as a front end interface (eth1) and a back end / management interface / physical host (eth0).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Review the Configuring IBM BPM endpoints to match your topology [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tsec_thirdpartyauthentication_endpointservice.html] topic in the IBM Knowledge Center to properly configure all endpoint URLs or all external endpoint URLs to go to a particular server (such as a web server). 


With all URLs (which is the scenario described above), it will include internal server to server communication like with Process Inspector.

As you may not prefer the default behavior of using the internal servers, review the Customizing the Process Server or Process Center cluster to work with a web server on V8.5.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tconfig_custom_cluster_env_8501.html] topic in the IBM Knowledge Center for details to customize your environment so that it can function properly as a cluster with a web server.

Note: In later versions of BPM, there are some added admin tasks to make some of this work easier. Review the Customizing IBM BPM to work with a web server [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.6/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tconfig_custom_cluster_env.html] topic in the IBM Knowledge Center for details.
