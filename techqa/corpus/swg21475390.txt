Title: IBM Statistics 19 will not install via MSI command line, receive error: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Statistics 19 will not install via MSI command line. I try to install version 19 on a Windows 32 bit machine via MSI. Therefore I copied the complete win32 folder from the DVD to C:\temp folder because in this folder you can find the necessary MSI and other files needed to push the installation.
I open a command prompt and change the directory to C:\temp\win32 and run the following command according to the instructions in the SPSS License Administrator's Guide on page 4 in the Command Line Example:

MSIExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 19.msi" /qn /L*v 19log.txt

After running the command the program was installed in the default directory C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19. In the C:\temp\win32 the 19log.txt was also created and the text in the log confirms that the program was installed successfully.

However, the following error is returned when attempting to run the program:

"C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19\stats.exe

This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."

How to install IBM SPSS Statistics 19 on Windows via MSI?

This problem also appears when installing on a Windows 2003 server for a network license and try to start Statistics 19 on the server, I get the message:
"The application failed to initialize properly." 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround 

Available
.
One possible cause of this problem is that the Microsoft Visual C++
redistributables the application requires did not execute and install
properly during installation of the Statistics application. You can run
them manually post-installation from here:
.
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19\VC8\Vcredist_x86.exe
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19\VC9\Vcredist_x86.exe
(the file names may be slightly different for 64-bit installations)
.
For Vista, Windows 7, or Server 2008 installations, be sure to
right-click and select Run As Administrator to properly execute the
installation of the redistributables.
Temporarily disable anti-virus, firewall and spyware software.
.
Once those installations complete, you should be able to launch the
application successfully.
.
If you would like to run the installation of the redistributables silent
you can create a batch file from the instructions below.
.
These are the commands used to create the batch files:
.
For 32bit Windows:
.
cd \program files\ibm\spss\statistics\19\vc8
msiexec -i "vcredist.msi" /qn
cd \program files\ibm\spss\statistics\19\vc9
vcredist_x86.exe /q:a /c:"VCREDI~1.EXE /q:a /c:""msiexec /i vc_red.msi
/qn"" "
.
For 64bit Windows:
.
cd \program files\ibm\spss\statistics\19\vc8
msiexec -i "vcredist.msi" /qn
cd \program files\ibm\spss\statistics\19\vc9
vcredist_x64.exe /q:a /c:"VCREDI~2.EXE /q:a /c:""msiexec /i vc_red.msi
/qn"" "
.

VC9 (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86 9.0.21022) shipped
with SPSS 19 extracted files appear in root directory. Alternatively you
can use VC9 SP1 (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86
9.0.30729.17) which is available at Microsoft.com
