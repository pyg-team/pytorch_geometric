Why are Java applications blocked by your security settings with the latest Java? [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml]

In the Java 6 Control Panel, 

1. Click on the "Advanced" tab. 
2. Under "Security" section, Expand the "Mixed code (Sandboxed Vs. trusted) security verification" option We will see the four options under this. 
3. Click on the second option i.e. "Enable - hide warning and run with protections" By enabling this, the user will not see the warning dialog box and Java will internally take care of executing the application with protections.
