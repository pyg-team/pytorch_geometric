APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product: i5OS for AS400 agent
   
   
   Severity: 3
   
   Approver: John Ripstra
   Reported Release: 6.2.2
   Compid: 5724C04A4
   
   Problem Description: i5OS Agent starts but then ends abnormally
   
   
   Problem: When using ENDOMA or GO OMA option 3 and specifying
   *IMMED,
   JOBSn *USRSPC(s) are not properly deleted in QAUTOTMP.  The next
   startup
   of the agent causes additional user spaces to be created.  If
   this is
   done several times, once the list of user spaces reaches 36, the
   agent
   will fail to start up.
   
   LOCAL FIX: When ending the agent, make sure to use the default
   of
   *CNTRLD rather than *IMMED to allow the agent to remove
   temporary workspaces.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When ending the agent, make sure to use the default
   of *CNTRLD rather than *IMMED to allow the agent to remove
   temporary workspaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Monitoring Agent for i5/OS starts but ends suddenly with an
   error.
   
   During startup of the Monitoring Agent for i5/OS, an attempt to
   create a user space in the library QAUTOTMP for an enabled
   situation fails because we have already reached the maximum
   number of unique user spaces for that situation. The job log for
   the CT_AGENT job will have a C2M1601 message that indicates a
   SIGABRT signal was raised, followed by a CEE9901 message that
   indicates that the application ended abnormally due to an
   unhandled exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Monitoring Agent for i5/OS now performs cleanup of known
   uniquely named user spaces prior to starting the agent. This
   will allow the agent to create new user spaces and start
   successfully.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0009
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  When stopping the agent, make sure to use the default option of
   *CNTRLD rather than *IMMED. Stopping the agent with the *CNTRLD
   option allows the agent to shutdown cleanly, removing the
   temporary user spaces.
