QUESTION
 Will the WebGUI work with the new operating mode in Internet Explorer 11 called Enterprise Mode? 

ANSWER
Internet Explorer Enterprise Mode only applies to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, these operating system versions are not supported by TIP 2.2.

This means that this mode is not supported by WebGUI and this is also not planned.
