Title: IBM IlrBRLError when checking project consistency in ODM Decision Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Decision Center, when I click on "Check Project Consistency" under the Analyze tab, I see the following eror:
ilog.rules.teamserver.brm.builder.IlrBuildException: 
ilog.rules.brl.util.IlrBRLError: file not found: language/extendedBAL.xsd 
at ilog.rules.teamserver.brm.builder.IlrBuilder.doConvert(IlrBuilder.java:700) 
at ilog.rules.teamserver.brm.builder.IlrBuilder.getBuildResult(IlrBuilder.java:446) 
at ilog.rules.teamserver.ejb.ruleset.IlrRulesetArchiveGenerator.doAddRuleArtifactToArchiveBuilder1(IlrRulesetArchiveGenerator.java:882) 

The logs file show the following error: 
SEVERE: Fail to create BRL parser: Unable to found class 
'ilog.rules.studio.samples.custombrl.ExtendedBAL'


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This indicates that you are using a custom Business Rule Language (BRL), but have not packaged all of the required classes into the Decision Center ear.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Package the custom BRL implementation classes into Decision Center ear. Refer to the documentation at 

Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Decision Center > Customizing Decision Center > Integrating business rule authoring extensions > Integrating rule authoring extensions into Decision Center > Integrating a custom business rule language into Decision Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.dcenter.custom%2Ftopics%2Ftsk_authoring_dc_custombrl.html]

Make sure that no required classes are missing, and that the classes have been compiled with a JDK level which is the same as the Java level used by the application server on which Decision Center is deployed.
