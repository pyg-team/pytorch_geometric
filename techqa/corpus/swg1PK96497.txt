ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Doc Defect: Installation Guide does not clarify with Oracle inst
   allation character set AL32UTF8 requirement
   
   As of Build Forge 7.1.1.1 installation guide, the Oracle databas
   e creation requirement for the character set is not appropriatly
    clarified.
   
   Currently, the database character set requirement is listed unde
   r the installation guide as UTF-8.
   This is listed under the 7.1.1.1 instalation guide under the fol
   lowing section.
   
   Pre-installation Setup
   
   International data setup (p20)
   p.
   [...]
   3. Configure databases to use the UTF-8 character set and fonts
   that support international data. (p21)
   [...]
   Oracle: Set the character set to UTF8 - Unicode 3.0 on the insta
   nce when you install it.
   In the Database Configuration Assistant, the setting is made on
   the Initialization Parameters
   step on the Character Sets tab.
   
   Database Setup (p21)
   [...]
   Configure support for the UTF-8 character set and an appropriate
    collation. Typically, support
   for international data is specified when you create your databas
   e; international data support
   cannot be configured after database creation. You must install t
   he fonts you intend to use to
   display data. *Build Forge requires the use of international dat
   a (UTF-8 character sets).*
   
   Customer will generally set the Oracle database character set to
    UTF-8 as this character set is listed specificly in the install
   ation guide and supports Unicode 3.0 as of Oracle Database relea
   se 8.1.7 and later.

   Enabling Multilingual Support with Unicode Databases
   
   [...]
   UTF8
   
   The UTF8 character set encodes characters in one, two, or three
   bytes. It is for ASCII-based platforms.
   
   The UTF8 character set has supported Unicode 3.0 since Oracle8i
   release 8.1.7 and will continue to support Unicode 3.0 in future
    releases of Oracle Database.
   
   This defect is to specificly list the character set requirement
   from UTF-8 to AL32UTF8, as the initial specification is somewhat
    misleading.
   
   Customer who configure their Oracle databases for character set
   UTF8 will recieve the following error message during the databas
   e test that is confusing.
   
   This database is not created with the UTF8 character set.
   
   The installation script is using the following query to obtain t
   he Oracle database character set.
   
   SELECT SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'LANGUAGE') FROM DUAL
   
   From this, the installer is searching for the AL32UTF8 listed at
    the end of this query.
   Customer who has set their database to UTF8 will be left consufe
   d until they are informed of the AL32UTF8 requirement.
   
   After the database is recreated with AL32UTF8 character set, cus
   tomer can complete the installation as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   encoding for Oracle.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added instructions for specifying AL32UTF8
