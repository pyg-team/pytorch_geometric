APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During SSL Handshake, DataPower will include extensions when
   using a TLS version prior to 1.2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1.  Change behavior of backend device to ignore extensions
   (which should already be)
   
   2.  Use a different TLS version which supports extensions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower injected TLS signature algorithms extension for all
   protocol versions, when it is only applicable to TLSv1.2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.2.0.14, 7.5.0.8, 7.5.1.7, 7.5.2.6 and
