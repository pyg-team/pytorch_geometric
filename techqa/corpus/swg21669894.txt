Title: IBM Collect troubleshooting data for process applications that implement an Advanced Integration Service for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having trouble implementing an integration using the Advanced Integration Service . You would like to know what information you must collect (MustGather) so that support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support, it will expedite the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

SYMPTOM
The interaction between the business process definition (BPD) and the Service Component Architecture (SCA) application through the Advanced Integration Service component does not go through successfully and you see errors or exceptions or incorrect data being exchanged through it. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To help us diagnose the problem, provide the following preliminary information: 

 1. Run the following command to obtain the version information of IBM Business Process Manager Advanced:
    BPM_Installation_root\bin\versionInfo.bat |sh -fixpacks -ifixes
    
    
 2. Provide the complete process application (.twx) file. If your application consists of more than one AIS component, provide the details of the AIS component that is causing the problem.
    
    
 3. If the AIS component is working correctly in a similar environment, for example development or test, then provide a sample input and output for this AIS service when the corresponding AIS component executes successfully. If possible, create a simple sample that demonstrates the issue along with the corresponding input and output data.
    
    
 4. Collect trace by completing the following steps in the Integrated Solutions Console:
    
    
    Note: Enabling trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction time outs and errors. Disable trace after collecting the requested information.
    
     1. Click ​Troubleshooting​ ​>​ ​Log and Trace​ and select the server for which you want to change the settings. ​Note: AppTarget is the main process server Java™ virtual machine (JVM).
        
        
     2. ClickChange Log Detail Levels​. 
        
        
     3. Select the runtime​ tab to dynamically set the trace. The runtime tab does not require a restart. 
        
        
     4. Set the trace string on the AppTarget cluster member server to *=info:SCA.*=all:WLE.*=all
        
        
        If there are any permission-related errors in the log files, then add the following trace string to the previous trace specification:
        com.ibm.ws.security.*=all
        
        
     5. Ensure that you have set the maximum trace file size (recommendation: 20MB) and the number of historical trace files (recommendation: 20) to an appropriate value. You can find those values atServers > Application Servers >server_name> Diagnostic Trace Service.
        
        
     6. Reproduce the problem and write down the time stamp. Check thetrace.logfile to ensure that the time of the issue is covered in the file.
        
        
    
    
 5. Gather the complete server log files and the ffdc directory. Archive (.zip file) all of the log files.
    
    
 6. Delete the trace string from the Log Detail Level for your server. When you remove and save settings in the Runtime tab, this process stops the log tracing.
    
    
 7. Send the data that is gathered in the first four steps using the information from the Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] document.
