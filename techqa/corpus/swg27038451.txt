Q&A 
Q : What steps should one take to enable responsive webdesign (tablet support) in older themes (7.x / 8.0) after migration? 

A: To complete the responsive design in a 6.1.5 modular theme, you can use the mobile navigation from 8001 theme as it is much lighter . The layouts however do not need to change. These are already responsive. 

Here are two articles on responsive design:

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-responsive-design-2/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-responsive-design-2/] 


Q: Do we have any document or links which explain migration from Teamsite to WCM 8 or 7? 

A: We do not have any external documentation that documents the migration from Teamsite to WCM 7 or 8 at this time. There are several strategies that can be used to perform the migration and some customer's have successfully migrate from Teamsite using WCI 


Q: Will the PPM tool take care of all the content on a page? 

A: Yes, all metadata and content will remain intact (@approx 44.05 of recording) 


Q: Can I file my layouts to be used? (@approx 45.46) 

A: Yes, it is an .HTML file that you use to apply the layout (more detail @approx 46.14 of recording)
