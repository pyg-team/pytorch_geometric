APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RACF uses dates with a year of '71' as the century cutover date,
   treating dates with years less than '71' as 20xx but years '71'
   and higher as 19xx.
   .
   CICS is using the year '70' instead for this comparison. So,
   userids with revoke date, resume date, group revoke or group
   resume date with a year of '70' will be treated differently in
   CICS than by RACF.
   .
   For example, a user id with a REVOKE DATE of 01/01/70 will be
   considered by RACF to be revoked in the year 2070, so they still
   should be able to logon, but CICS considers it to be 1970, so it
   disallows logon.
   .
   The following messages may be seen:
   .
   DFHXS1203  The userid supplied in the verification request for
   userid <userid> is revoked. This occurred in transaction
   <tranid> when userid <userid> was signed on at netname
   <netname>.
   .
   DFHSN1120 Signon at {netname |console | terminal }portname by
   user <userid> has failed because the {userid | group access} has
   been revoked.
   .

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a year other than '70'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MSGDFHCE3546 appears when using CESN to *
   *                      signon to a terminal with a USERID      *
   *                      which is already signed on at the       *
   *                      terminal and has a REVOKE date of 2070. *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   RACF uses REVOKE dates with a 2-digit year. RACF interprets
   dates as 20yy when yy is less than 71, and 19yy when yy is 71 or
   higher. This means that year 70 is 2070. When a RACF USERID is
   initially signed on to a terminal using the CESN signon
   transaction, a RACROUTE VERIFY ENVIR=CREATE command is used to
   signon the user. The policing of the REVOKE status of the USERID
   for this signon is performed by RACF.
   The same USERID signs on again at the same terminal using CESN.
   This time, CICS invokes DFHXSSB INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA to
   perform an optimized check of USERID and PASSWORD and to check
   the REVOKE date of the USERID.
   DFHXSSB treats a revoke year of 70 as 1970 instead of 2070 so
   fails the signon request. This produces message DFHCE3546 at the
   terminal.
