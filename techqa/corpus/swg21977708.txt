AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter for HP ALM 1.1.2 and 1.1.2.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The IBM Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter can be updated with a corrected Tomcat by following the instructions below. This is only applicable to products deployed on Apache Tomcat. Be sure to upgrade all the components that your deployment uses.

Note: Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter 1.1.x product modification may contain updated Tomcats, however 1.1.x iFixes typically do not update Tomcat. 

NOTE: Apache Tomcat is only included by IBM Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter version 1.1.2 and 1.1.2.1 Previous versions of the RLIA SE HP Adapter were released as WAR files only.

To obtain the latest Apache Tomcat, please visit the Apache Tomcat website [https://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi] and download versions 6.0.45 or higher version (in 6.0 stream). Once the Tomcat is obtained, follow the instructions below to replace the existing Tomcat:

Upgrading Tomcat installation 

 1. Stop the Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter server.

Note: The applications may be running in different application server instances or using a delegated converter. 

 2. Navigate to the original install directory and rename the Tomcat folder

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat

to

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat-Original

This will ensure that the original Tomcat is kept as a backup in the event a restore is required.

Example (Linux):
mv <InstallDir>/server/tomcat <InstallDir>/server/tomcat-Original 

 3. Unzip the new Tomcat file provided by support to the Installation directory. 

Example (Linux): unzip <newInsallZip> -d <InstallDir>/server/tomcat/ 

 4. Delete the following directories from the exploded archive:

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/webapps/docs
<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/webapps/examples
<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/webapps/host-manager
<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/webapps/manager 

 5. Copy the Apache Tomcat SSL Keystore from the backup:

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat-Original/ibm-team-ssl.keystore

to

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/ibm-team-ssl.keystore 

 6. Copy the Apache Tomcat Server configuration from the backup:

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat-Original/conf/server.xml

to

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/conf/server.xml 

 7. Copy the HP Adapter WAR file from the backup:

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat-Original/webapps/hpqm.war

to

<InstallDir>/server/tomcat/webapps/hpqm.war 

 8. Restart the Rational Lifecycle Integration Adapter server
