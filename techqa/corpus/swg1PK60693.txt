APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following information needs to be included in the
   Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1:
   
   Prior to WebSphere Application Server V6.1, the
   management processes did not honor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
   configurations that were set by system properties.
   
   Starting with WebSphere Application Server V6.1, the method to
   manage SSL configurations changed. Prior to V6.1, you could
   not centrally-manage SSL settings, which caused various
   conflicts. Having centrally-managed SSL settings removes the
   ability for applications to use their own configuration code.
   Centrally-managing these configurations improves application
   portablitiy.

   ****************************************************************
   In WebSphere Application Server V6.1, application servers
   inherit the SSL configuration as deployed from the cell level
   down to the endpoint level. If your applications rely on
   individually-managed SSL configurations from a previous version
   of WebSphere Application Server, communication errors, such as
   handshake errors, might occur among the servers. Ensure that
   your applications are using the central management features of
   WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 for SSL configurations.
   
   The documentation needs to warn as well as explain why
   "handshake errors" are occurring under these conditions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Two information center topics have been updated to explain this
   issue.
   
   In the "Secure communications using Secure Sockets Layer,"
   topic, the following note has been added to the"Scope Selection"
   section:
   
   Note: If your applications are relying on SSL configurations
   that were set as individual settings for each SSL configuration
   in the topology, but your application servers have inherited the
   SSL configuration as deployed from the cell level down to the
   endpoint level, then there is the possibility of communication
   errors occurring among servers (for example, handshake errors).
   You need to ensure that your applications are operating
   consistent with the central management of SSL configurations.
   --------------------------
   In the "Errors configuring Secure Sockets Layer encrypted
   access" topic, the following note has been added to  "SSL
   handshake failure error when no trusted
    certificate is found" section:
   
   Note: As default, Websphere Application Server uses the key.p12
   and trust.p12 files for any communication between WebSphere
   Application Servers (for example between node agent and
   the application server or vice versa). If WebSphere Application
   Server is looking for a certificate in some file other than
   these, then it is possible that your application establishes the
   secure socket layer (SSL) configuration by using system
   properties, established with the System.setProperty() method.
   That is, SSL configurations are managed for each of your
   processes, and you have had to maintain individual settings for
   each SSL configuration in the topology.
   
   Prior to WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1, the WebSphere
   Application Server management processes allowed the
   individually-managed SSL configurations which were set by system
   properties. Your pre-Version 6.1 system properties settings were
   processed successfully.
   
   With WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1, central
   management of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) configuration occurs.
   Applications that use SSL connections based on values set for
   system properties instead of using the centrally managed default
   dynamic SSL configuration can experience handshake failures.
   Node agent to application server communications is being
   governed by the default dynamic SSL configuration in WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.1 and not through the system
   properties you set. You may need to adjust your application to
   use the centrally-managed SSL configuration of WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.1.

   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you read
   this text. To access the latest on-line documentation, complete
   the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click the
   appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version and
   in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more information on
   the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following Web site:
   http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the March 2008
   update to the information center.
