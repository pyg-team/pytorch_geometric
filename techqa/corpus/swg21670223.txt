QUESTION
 There is no longer a samadapter resource in my automation policy in Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatform (TSAMP) Version 4.1, so how can I find out if samadapter is running? 

ANSWER
With TSAMP v4.1, the samadapter no longer needs to be part of the automation policy ... there's no IBM.ServiceIP resource required anymore. The samadapter is now has its own event publisher to allow it to communicate with the master IBM.RecoveryRM process. In addition, the samadapter is now always running on the same node as the Master IBM.RecoveryRM process. 

The command "samadapter status" can still be used to returns status. This command checks status of Publisher and the samadapter process on the MasterNode 

samadapter would be running if 'lssamctrl' shows : 

 * EnablePublisher = EEZ 


It would not be running if 'lssamctrl' shows :  * EnablePublisher = Disabled 


If samadapter is running, then 'ps -ef' would also show a running process named "SAMAdapter"
