ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue:
   The customers users use a browser to access certain databases
   e.g a custom application or standard mailfile & they sometimes
   use the browsers option to "Send"-> "page as email". They have
   Lotus notes set as the default mail sender. When you use the
   "send page as email" function, the document/mail is rendered as
   a html file and this is what gets imported into the client. They
   have noticed that the date stamp from the document/mail will be
   placed into the new mail in americian format mm/d/yyyy instead
   of european format dd/mm/yyyy.
   
   The customer has tested this across several platforms & found
   the issue occurs with all of them:
   Browsers: IE6, IE7,IE8
   Notes clientss: Notes 7.0.1, Notes 7.0.2, Notes 7.0.3
   Servers: Domino 7.0.4FP1 on AIX, Domino 7.0.2FP2 on wintel
   
   He also found that the problem does not occur with domino 5.0.12
   (The customer is aware that this is no longer supported but
   feels that as it worked in that version, it should work in this
   newer version)  the customer also tested with other
   (non-domino) servers and there is no issue. so he is convinved
   that the issue is a domino issue.
   
   - I tested with Domino 7.0.2 and IE8
   
   1. installed 7.0.2FP2 server
   2. installed admin 7.0.2 client
   3. created user with a mail7 template & internet password.
   4. I sent several mails to both, some with just text, some with
   attachments & some with screenshots
   5. I created a location document for the user, and set the
   Internet browser to "Microsoft internet Explorer"
   6. I opened the Internet exploerer browser snd set the deafut
   mail provided to lotus notes. I closed the browser for the
   changes to take effect.
   7. I logged into the notes client & in the addressbar i
   enterened the address for the mailfile, an internet explorer
   window appearred and entered the login credentials.
   6. I opened a mail and tried to use the option File -> Send ->
   "Page by email"
   ===> the IE8 browser then creates and renders the page as a html
   file and this is what gets imported into the client, and the
   date entry is placed into a data entry in the format mm/dd/yyyy
   instead of what it was dd/mm/yyyy
   
   e.g:
   :
   <div align="center"><b><font size="2">Nessa
   Admin/EN702</font></b>
   <p><font size="2">09/24/2010 04:12 PM</font></div></td><td
   width="1%"
   bgcolor="#E1E1E1"><img width="102" height="1"
   src="/icons/ecblank.gif"
   border="0" alt=""><br>
   <div align="right"><font size="2">To</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
   :
   
   see html file sent to attachments db: test1.htm
   
   whereas in the mailfile it correctly shows in the format
   dd/mm/yyyy -> 24/09/2010 so to me it seems like the issue is an
   IE8 issue, IE8 renders the page as html & this is what gets
   imported into the notes client or thunderbird mail clients.
   however the customer disagrees as the problem did not occur in
   Version 5, and does not occur with other non-domino servers.
