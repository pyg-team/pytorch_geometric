ERROR DESCRIPTION

   preservation plan, there are lots of details displayed for the
   first custodian.  If you then press the "Next" or Previous"
   buttons to show other custodians, less information is
   displayed.  Even if you navigate back to the original
   custodian, there will be less information displayed than the
   first time that custodian was displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If you go back to the full list of custodians for the
   preservation plan, and click the link for another custodian,
   the full details wil be returned.
