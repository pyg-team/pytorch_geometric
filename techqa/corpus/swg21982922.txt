 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Opening too many documents in ICN causes a hang and requires a restart. 

SYMPTOM
Errors similar to the following may be found in the logs: 

 Timed out waiting for 180000
Too many open files


CAUSE
Not enough resources assigned for opening documents.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Tune your ICN Datasource's connection pool in accordance with the following:
Set minimum connections to 0 (to avoid any stale connections).
Set Maximum connections to 200.
Set Connection timeout to 180.
Set Reap timeout to 180.
Set Unused timeout to 1800.
Set aged timeout to 0.
Set Purge Policy to FailingConnectionOnly.

Any changes to the Datasource configuration will require a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) restart to get activated.
