Title: IBM Error "Cannot library DXL file or directory" when opening IBM Rational DOORS Module - United States

Text:
DXL; library; access; client; script; Addins TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I open a module, I receive this error:

Cannot library and DXL location Permission Denied" 
Followed by the path to the DXL script. What does it mean? 

CAUSE
The error "Cannot library DXL file or directory." only happens when there is a problem opening a particular file by using a system open call. All the DOORS client is doing is asking the system to open this file and if the system can't then it returns an error and DOORS interpret that and provide an error as a result. 
The general cause for this error is the fact that due to various reasons that DXL file is not accessible for the DOORS client.



ANSWER
Ensure the path to, and the target DXL file, are accessible to the system and the user running the DOORS client.
