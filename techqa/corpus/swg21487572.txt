Title: IBM NPTESTS won't produce K-S tests in Release 19 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm running Release 19 of IBM SPSS Statistics. I'm attempting to run K-S tests in the newer NPTESTS procedure, but despite my specifying one or more tests, using either observed sample values or specified values for parameters, I'm unable to get my test results. I keep getting the following message:

No tests or confidence intervals have been requested.
Execution of this command stops.

Why is this happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been fixed in for Release 19.0.0.1. In Release 19.0, please use the older NPAR TESTS procedure (in the menus, Analyze>Nonparametric Tests>Legacy Dialogs>1-Sample K-S. Or, if you want a K-S test using a normal distribution with observed mean and standard deviation, you can paste in the NPTESTS command and edit it so that it doesn't mention any specific test on the ONESAMPLE subcommand, such as:

NPTESTS 
/ONESAMPLE TEST(x).

We apologize for any resulting inconvenience.
