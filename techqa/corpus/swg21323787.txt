QUESTION
 How can I use a DLL built with IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

ANSWER
If you wish to call a DLL built with Rational Rhapsody from a program external to Rhapsody, then you will need to make sure that you initialize the Rhapsody framework in order to successfully start and run a statechart in the DLL. 

To do this: 

 1. Make sure that you have copied the framework dll (MSoxfdll.dll) from Rhapsody (Share\LangCpp\Lib) to your EXE project directory. 
 2. Then you will need to execute OXF::start(); 


One way to do this would be to just copy the contents of main() from the Rhapsody generated main file to your current project main file.
