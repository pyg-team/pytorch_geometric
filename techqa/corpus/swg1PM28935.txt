ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Dimension editor - Performance degradation from 9.0 to 9.4.1fp3
   or 9.5 adding elements and moving elements to a
   consolidation.????Customer reported that since upgrading from
   9.0sp3 to 9.4.1fp3_hf12 they have experienced performance issues
   when cutting and paste a large amount of elements (500) from an
   excel sheet into Tm1 server explorer dimension and also when
   Copy and paste 500 n-level elements to top consolidation as
   children.????RESUTLS:??Add 500 elements to dimension ???
   ??9.0sp3 took 56 sec. ??9.4.1fp3_hf12 took  10 min.??9.5.2
   pre-release took 8min 40sec.????RESUTLS: Copy and paste 500
   n-level elements to top consolidation as children.????9.0sp3
   took 2 sec. to complete??9.4.1fp3_hf12 took 14min 45sec??9.5.2
   pre-release took 15min. 45sec.????Customer understands they can
   use Turbo Integrator to add large amounts of element to a
   dimension but have a standard procedure  in place that  forces
   them to copy  elements from an excel sheet and paste into
   dimension editor.??After copying  elements into the dimension
   they then need to move them under appropriate
   consolidations.????I did suggest  using dimension worksheets
   but they  said they have over 500000 elements in the dim. and
   only have Office 2003. ???? They  said that this process can
   take up to 35min to complete in version 9.4.1fp3 and  only  2 -
   3 min in version 9.0????Customer would like to have this logged
   as bug.   Is  this a bug or  by design due to the new objects
   locking model  starting with 9.1 version. If this is by design
   and no current plans to fix  can we get  an official statement
   /explanation to pass along to customer???
