PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting data for problems with the integration between Sterling Applications and IBM MQ. Collecting this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


COLLECTING DATA
1. GENERATING TRACES
 * For MQ problems, when you are not sure whether fault is with Sterling or MQ, use the following to enable a detailed trace on both Server and client (JMS consumer) machines. These traces can then be passed over to MQ team(see queue names) for analysis. WebSphere MQ provides the ability to generate trace files containing information about its internal processing. These traces can capture problems reported by the operating system or the network, report on application [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21174924] activity, and pinpoint the root cause of unexpected or unwanted behavior. This document provides instructions for generating WebSphere MQ traces in many different environments across all supported WebSphere MQ platforms in order to investigate and solve problems.




2. REPRODUCE PROBLEM 
 * Provide recreate steps.
 * Provide relevant screen shots.




3. COLLECT DATA
 *  Collect all data and send to MQ Support




SUBMITTING DATA TO IBM SUPPORT
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis:

 * Service Request (SR)
 * E-Mail
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
 *  If the compressed file is less than 5M then send via Ecurep e-mail @ sterling_support@ecurep.ibm.com and enter the following in the subject line PMR 12345.999.000.zip 
 *  If the compressed file is greater than 5M then send to Ecurep via FTP
