APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Interview questionnaires are automatically being set to
   "Completed" status when one of the custodians responds to an
   interview reminder even though there are still other custodians
   who have not responded.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In certain circumstances, standard Virtual Interviews are
   automatically closed before all of the matter targets responded.
    When the status of the interview is changed during the process
   of sending notices, IBM Atlas Suite incorrectly interprets the
   interview as completed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.6.
