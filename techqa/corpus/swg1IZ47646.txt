ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITIM server truncates attributes on provisioning to
   TARGET
   system:
   ENV: ITIM SERVER ALL 4.6 and 5.0.  REPORTED On 5.0
   ADAPTER = N/A/  TESTED with RACF ADAPTER SSL
   PRODUCTION ENFIRONMENT
   DESCRIPTION
   In ITIM, we cannot save an attribute value with leading or
   trailing
   spaces. In provisioing policy, if the customer has tried to add
   an
   entitlement parameter with a leading space in its value and
   saved it as
   a constant, then this parameter would have been saved in the
   policy only
   after trimming this value. The same is true for creating an
   attribute
   with leading/trailing spaces  for any other entity like person
   or other
   type of accounts.
   Hence, I don't see a way to have a workaround in ITIM  to retain
   the
   leading space as demanded by the customer scenario.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:  create a leading space for an attr on a
   provisioning request.  Valida the target get  the modify request
   and
   removed the leading space.  Set the leading space on the target
   and
   recon back.  Modify on ITIM server and leading space will be
   removed.
   
   TESTED on RACF TARGET.  Installitaion DATA filed.
   Desired Behavior:  Have the server allow the leading space when
   valid to
   the target,:
   
   WORKAROUND on place but not completely functional for all
   provisioning
   request.
   
   My current work around is to use the ITIMEXIT to catch the ADD
   AFTER and
   there I list the user grabbing the INSTALLATION DATA
   reconstructing it
   with a leading space and changing  it with an Alteruser command,
   not
   pretty, but it seems to work

LOCAL FIX
 *  WORKAROUND on place but not completely functional for all
   provisioning
   request.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected:
   Customers using leading or trailing spaces in attributes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix for this APAR is contained in the
   following maintenance packages:
   | Interim Fix | 5.0.0.5-TIV-TIM-IF0027
   With the exception of the password attribute, ITIM Server trims
   the leading/trailing spaces for an attribute value.  When an
   attribute value with leading/trailing spaces is submitted
   through GUI.
