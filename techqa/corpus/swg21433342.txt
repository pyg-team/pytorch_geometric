RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct this problem: 


 1. Remove the contents of the backup directory used for the WPMigrate.bat or WPMigrate.sh portal-pre-upgrade command. 
 2. Double check and/or redo all the steps for "Preparing the target environment" and "Preparing the source environment" documented in the Lotus Quickr 8.5 product documentation on the wiki at http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Migrating_qp85 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Migrating_qp85]. Pay particular attention to:  1. Run the wsadmin command from Lotus Quickr 8.5 to 8.1.1.1 to exchange security certificates. 
     2.  Verify that you performed the scripting updates on 8.1.1.1. 
     3. Verify that the soap port is defined correctly, especially if you are migrating from a primary node. 
     4. Verify that the 8.1.1.1 server is started prior to running portal-pre-upgrade. 
    
    
 3. Rerun the full WPMigrate.bat or WPMigrate.sh portal-pre-upgrade command on 8.1.1.1 (see "Exporting the source data") and continue with migration.
