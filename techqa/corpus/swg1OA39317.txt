ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IMS events missing BSM_Identity and BSM_SubIdentity fields.
   
   A lot of Event Pump events for IMS address spaces such as
   IBA1IRLM, IBA1FDBR,IBA1SCI, and IBA1GOM, do not have 19 column
   for BSM_Identity, except the IBA1IMS address space. Also there
   are a set of events like IHS407I which have no BSM_SubIdentity
   field for AREA name.

   Some z/OS regions can run on a different z/OS image than the IMS
   subsystem that it is tracking or can appear as a child of the
   z/OS image under which it runs or as a child of the IMS
   subsystem it is tracking. This feature has not been included in
   the Tivoli EIF rules files for IMS event feed. BSM_Identity and
   BSM_SubIdentity fields can be filled by blanks after processing
   events from such kind of IMS objects. In this situation Tivoli
   Business Service Manager unable to correlate IMS events to
   service instances and determine service instance status.
   
   Several Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS event feeds, including IMS,
   send legacy events that are not meaningful for Netcool/OMNIbus
   server and are not used by it anymore. Most of them contain
   empty Summary field and severity for these events are not set -
   they all have Intermediate severity. User unable to get any
   meaningful information from such kind of events.
   
   Tally field in alerts.status table of Netcool/OMNIbus database
   is not automatically incremented for duplicated events. User is
   unable to observe identical events on Netcool/OMNIbus console
   or/and in Tivoli Integrated Portal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  OA39317 APAR is a fix pack package which resolves several
   independent issues with Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS on
   distributed platform. Most of these issues are not related to
   each other and combined together into a single package for easy
   use to apply. Rules zos_event.rules and zos_ims_event.rules
   files were updated to properly fill the BSM_Identity and
   BSM_SubIdentity fields, discard legacy TBSM 3.1 and IMS events.
   Netcool/OMNIbus zos_deduplication trigger was updated to
   to increment Tally field each time the duplicated event is
   received.
   
   There is an associated distributed platform update for Tivoli
   EIF Probe. This update is in MDV 4.2.2.7-TIV-EP-FP0007,
   and can be located on the IBM Tivoli Event Pump support site
   under Downloads.
