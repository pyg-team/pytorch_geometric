java heap websphere TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users running Datacap Navigator get an error stating Error 599: Java Heap Space. This error can occur during any operation although is more commonly seen during login. In some cases, the user can click through the error and continue operation. 

CAUSE
There is not enough WebSphere heap space configured for the total load being placed on it by all Datacap Navigator users.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the WebSphere heap space. 

 1. On the WebSphere server, run the WebSphere administrative console. 
 2. In the Servers section, select WebSphere application servers. 
 3. Select the server being used by Datacap Navigator, usually server1. 
 4. Expand Java and Process Management and select Process definition. 
 5. Select Java Virtual Machine. 
 6. Select the Runtime tab and note the current values for Maximum heap size and Current heap size. 
 7. Click on the Configuration tab and enter new values for these fields. The recommendation is to select a value for each that is 50% to 100% larger than the current value. 
 8. Click OK, then restart WebSphere.


If the error still occurs, repeat the process and increase the values further.
