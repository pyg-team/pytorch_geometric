Image 2 shows that a Non-Admin User cannot see the comments using the same Organization Record


CAUSE
1. Root Cause: The Default WorkGroup has no OrgName / Scope access set.
2. When a comment is initially added, it has no OrgAccess set. After the Parent Org is changed / activated, a wokrflow called and updates the OrgName field of the comment records. This is what causes the comment to become lost.


ENVIRONMENT
10.5.1/3.5.1.3



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
a. Login to TRIRIGA as Non-Admin user.
b. Navigate to Portfolio>Organizations.
c. Open any form under Organizations Module. 
d. Go to Notes and Documents Tab.
e. Revise form and add comment under Comments section.
f. Save and then Activate form. 
g. User unable to see recently added comment.
