QUESTION
 What is the difference between the Download All action and the Download As Original action in IBM Content Navigator? 

ANSWER

Download As Original action will just download the first part of the document and is available for use with documents that have only one part or when a document has multiple parts, but you don't want a user to download beyond the first part, i.e when the goal is to not expose the ability to download all parts of a multipart document.

Download All action will download all parts of the document. If the document has just one part, then it will be downloaded as is, instead of as a compressed zip file. If there are multiple parts, then all the parts are downloaded as a single zip file. This action is available for use with documents containing multiple parts.
A document part refers to the logical entity that stores the contents of the document. A document can have more than one type of content, say text, image etc. Each of those content elements can be put into a document part. Thus a document is a collection of one or more document parts.

Note that neither action downloads the annotations created on the document. Only the base content parts are downloaded by these actions.
