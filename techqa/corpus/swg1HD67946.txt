ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  KWE : RULES IN NC STARTER MODEL ARE NOT
   APPLIED.
   .
   Scenario.
   .
   1) Open the CATProcess
   2) Activate CATPart (design) under assembly of the
   part Operation
   3) Return to CATProcess
   4) Double click on Drilling operation
   5) See that the option cycle syntax and spindle
   output (It is OFF)
   6) See the option of Spindle Speed and Feedrate
   (They are ON)
   7) Expand the attributes node in the PPR structure
   rule base should show update symbol
   8) Contextually select manual solve of rules base
   9) Return to the drilling operation
   10) Cycle syntax and spindle output should be on
   (but not happened)
   11) Auto feed / speed buttons should be turned off
   ( but not happened)
   .
   Expected Result
   .
   Knowledge rule should be correctly executed and
   the options should be changed accordingly.

   Documentation Modification.
   Modifications done in two chapters
   .
   1)
   Knowledge Expert
   About Expert Checks
   .
   Be careful when using multiple types in the (for
   all)  field.
   If there is no object of one type declared in
   the ?For All? field in the document (for example no
   Shell in the document), the rule will not be
   executed even if there are object sof other types
   declared in the ?For All? field in the document (for
   example one object Hole in the document).
   2)
   Methodology
   Optimizing the Evaluation of Knowledge Expert Rule
   Bases
   Handling Conditions With One Type
   If in the body of a rule or of a check, there are
   only conditions (after the If keyword) with one
   type, it is more efficient to create several rules with
   one type in the ?For all? field.
   S:Shell;H:Hole
   If (H.Activity == true)
   Message(?All holes are activated?)
   If (S.Activity == true)
   Message(?All shells are activated?)
   You must write two rules :
   H:Hole
   If (H.Activity == true)
   Message(?All holes are activated?)
   And
   S:Shell
   If (S.Activity == true)
   Message(?All shells are activated?)
   .
