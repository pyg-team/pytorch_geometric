   The IBM Packaging Utility was not setting a proper lock
   while running, that would prevent the user from mistakenly
   trying an uninstall of the Packaging Utility while the
   Packaging Utility is running.  The uninstall attempt while
   the offering was running was leading to an error message and
   an incomplete uninstall of the Packaging Utility
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix was made in the IBM Packaging Utility to add a lock to
   prevent an uninstall attempt while the Packaging Utility is
   running.  This fix will be delivered in the 1.5 version.
