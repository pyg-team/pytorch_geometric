   java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
   com/ibm/di/utils/OS400AdapterUtils (Unsupported major.minor
   version 49.0)ﾚ>>
   ------
   There is a bug in the dispatcher installer v5.002 which is
   bundled with the i5OS 4.6.4 adapter. One of the classes in the
   itdiAgents.jar has been built with a higher java version than
   the one that runs with ITDI 6.0. Hence this exception is being
   observed on ITDI 6.0 with this dispatcher installer. It works
   fine on ITDI versions greater than 6.0.
   .
   CUSTOMER RECREATE: Yes, L2 and L3 as well
   .
   DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
   Do not throw the error message above.
   .
   STEPS TO DUPLICATE:
   Install i5OS 4.6.4 Adapter on ITDI 6.0.
   Run any adapter operation.
   .
   ENVIRONMENT: i5OS 4.6.4 Adapter
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use ITDI version greater than 6.0.
