   ****************************************************************
   01.The Developer for z Systems (RDz/IDz) CARMA installation
      verification program (IVP) mentions the default timeout
      value in the following message, not the actual value.
   
      1. Creating CARMA connection (timeout after 60 seconds)
   02.Re-associating an MVS sub-project with CARMA repository
      causes the PDS member in the MVS sub-project to lose its
      reference to the CA Endevor element on the host.
   03.This update matches the fix for IBM Debug Tool APAR PI81873 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI81873].
   04.When debugging COBOL V4, the listing listing reader was not
      processing some variables correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The CARMA component is updated to show the actual connect
      timeout value.
   02.The IBM IDz Endevor integration has been changed to
      re-associate the PDS member when an association change is
      detected between the CA Endevor element and the PDS member
      in the MVS sub-project.
   03.This update matches the fix for IBM Debug Tool APAR PI81873 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI81873].
   04.The Integrated Debugger engine was updated to correctly
      process variables in the COBOL V4 listing, so that variables
      are displayed.
