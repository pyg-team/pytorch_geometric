 * Dynamic Workload Console installation fails on Windows 10 (166339)
 * Dynamic Workload Console installation fails on Windows 10 if JazzSm is installed in a virtual directory (i.e. C:\Program Files) and a pop-up message is displayed asking for credentials. To circumvent the problem, provide the JazzSm credentials or install both Dynamic Workload Console and JazzSm in a non-virtual directory.
