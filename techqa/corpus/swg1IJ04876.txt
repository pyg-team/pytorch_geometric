APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Incident cannot create an Investigation(oil) if the
   incident has an  inactive person record
   
   
   Error Message: BMXAA4214E - An unknown error has occurred.
    Please contact your system administrator for assistance.
   Gather the logs from the <HOME> directory and determine where
   and why the error is thrown.
   
   The above error message is issued when both the "Reported by"
   and the "Affected Person" are the same person record and in
   inactive status on the Incident(oil) record, when you now try to
   create  an Investigation(oil) record the error message is
   issued.
   
   Tested reproduced: 7607 with IFIX
   7.6.0.7-IFIX20170505-1619/also with lastest IFIX, 7609 and
   oil&Gas 7610

   This is a TAPE issue not oil&Gas
   
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1)Resources> People > create a person record TEST1 > status
   Active  / create associated Labor record TEST1 (Resources
   >Labor)>status Active
   2)Resources >People > create a person record TEST2> status
   Active / create associated Labor record TEST2 (Resources>Labor)
   > status Active
   3)Safety and Quality Management(oil) > select Incident(oil)
   4)Create new Incident  1171 > Reported by = TEST1 created in
   step 1,
   Affected Person = TEST1(both the same)
   5)change Incident status to queued(this can stay as new as well)
   6)Create new Incident 1175 > Reported by = TEST1 created in step
   1,
   Affected Person = TEST2(created in step 2)
   7)change  Incident status to queued
   8)People > select Person record TEST1 =  change satus to
   inactive
   9)People > select Person record TEST2 - change status to
   inactive
   10)Saftey and Quality Management(oil)  > Select Incident (oil)
   11) select Incident # 1171 (created in step 4)  note: Reported
   by and  Affected person are the same  person record and inactive
   12) More Actions > select create option > select Investigation
   Receive Error:  "BMXAA4214E - An unknown error has occurred.
   Please contact your system administrator for assistance. Gather
   the logs from  the <HOME> directory and determine where and why
   the error is thrown"  click ok
   13) select Incident #1175 - Reported by and Affected Person are
   different Person records and  both inactive
   14)More Actions > select create option > Investigation >
   Investigation record is successfully created  receive message
   "BMXAO0089E Investigation XXXXX created."
   
   What is the expected behaviour: Maximo should allow an
   Investigation record to be created from an Incident that has the
    same  "Reported By" and "Affected Person"  that is in inactive
   status
   
    Note: Maximo allows Investigation record to be created from an
   Inicident if the "Reported By" and the  "Affected Person"
   record  in  inactived status when it has  different Person
   records, so Maximo should allow an Investigation record to be
   created when the Incident's
   "Reported By" and "Affected Person" record are both the Same
   inactive Person record.
