Title: IBM Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapter Collection (CVE-2014-8730) - United States

Text:
WTX secure adapter collection security vulnerability SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) padding vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack affects WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapter Collection. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]

DESCRIPTION: 

Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapter Collection 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Download and install the interim fix for APAR PI32341 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Transformation+Extender&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=PI32341] from IBM Fix Central.

Installing this fix sets the following environment variables by default: 

 * 
 * 
 * 

Verify that this configuration change does not cause compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
To mitigate the vulnerability before you install the fix, set the environment variables with the following commands:

For WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection running on Windows, the commands are:
set GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE
set GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES_SSL=GSK_TRUE

For WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapters Collection running on Linux/UNIX/AIX, the commands are:
export GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE
export GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES_SSL=GSK_TRUE

Before you start WTX, set the environment variables in the shell where WTX runs.
Environment variables defined in a shell are inherited by any child processes.

To set the environment variables automatically, add the commands to the profile of the user ID that WebSphere Transformation runs under.

Verify that this configuration change does not cause compatibility issues.
