PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following error is occurring when attempting to apply the Tivoli Integrated Portal Feature Pack: 

""CTGWA0069E Not a valid TIP 2.1 Install Location." 

SYMPTOM
Installation fails with above error message.


CAUSE
A possible cause is that TIP 2.2 is already present, and hence there is no need for the Feature Pack. 

ENVIRONMENT
Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.1 feature pack

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the listIU output if TIP 2.2 is already installed. It would list an entry like this:


IU RootIU UUID: 2ADC4A33F09F4E85AD27963E850290C3 Name: TIPCore Version: 2.2.0.0 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
