APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have manipulated date strings and numeric values to create a
   DATETIMEw.d formatted date variable in SPSS Statistics.  You
   find however that while the underlying numeric value (formatted
   as a Fw.d) has very few to no non-zero decimal values, the
   DATETIMEw.d formatted version of this exact same value is filled
   with 'noise' in the decimal portion.

   Please refer to the Fix Pack schedule at
