QUESTION
 Using the TWL Table widget in the Dashboard Application Services Hub, can I "paint" the rows in different colors based on a "status" field in the Widget? 

CAUSE
Here is an example of what is being asked:
Rows painted a different color based on the "Status" field. The rows containing "In Progress" should be one color, and the rows containing "Future" should be in one color.

ANSWER
The TWL table widget does not support coloring the whole row. If you are using JazzSM 1.1.2.1 (DASH 3.1.2.1) or above, then you can use the custom column rendering feature to control the background color of a numeric column based on a value or threshold. 

( Available when editing the table configuration and selecting the columns to be included in the table. When you highlight one of the selected columns, and it is numeric, then the ConfigureColumnRendering button below the column list becomes enabled and you can configure various custom appearance options.) 

 
This is discussed in the online help for the table widget under "Editing a Table Widget". There is also a blog post on developerWorks that briefly covers this feature:
