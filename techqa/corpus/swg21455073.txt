PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When multiple Monitoring agents (including ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications, ITCAM Agent for J2EE Monitoring Agent, ITCAM Agent for HTTP Servers, and any other Tivoli Monitoring agents) are installed on a host, no more than 15 are visible in Tivoli Enterprise Portal at the same time. 

SYMPTOM
When multiple Monitoring agents (including ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications, ITCAM Agent for J2EE Monitoring Agent, ITCAM Agent for HTTP Servers, and any other Tivoli Monitoring agents) are installed on a host, no more than 15 are visible in Tivoli Enterprise Portal at the same time.


CAUSE
This is a limitation of IBM Tivoli Monitoring. No more than 15 Tivoli monitoring agents, as well as Tivoli Enterprise Managing Servers, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers, can be displayed under a host node.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that the total number of Monitoring agents running on a host at the same time does not exceed 15. If any Tivoli Enterprise Managing Server or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server processes are running on the host, the total number of these processes and Monitoring agents must not exceed 15.


Important: This limitation does not apply to the number of application or HTTP server instances monitored by any agent. Therefore, you can leave only one copy of each required agent on the host, and use it to monitor any number of application or HTTP server instances.
