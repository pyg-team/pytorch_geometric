PROBLEM
You have two domains and you only want user traffic to work in one direction between the domains. How do you cross certify domains in only one direction?

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

How you set up cross-certification for this depends on what you would be using it for. If you are setting this up strictly for user access, one-way cross-certification would work great. If you want to be able to replicate, it is more complicated.

For example, you have two domains, Domain A and Domain B, and the goal is to allow Domain A access to Domain B, but not allow Domain B access to Domain A.

To use this for user access:


 * 


To also replicate: 
 * 
 * 2. On your Domain A server create a cross certificate for your Domain A organization to your Domain B organization. 
 * 3. On your Domain A server in the Server Document -> Security tab ->Access Server field, list your Domain A organization (for example, if your Domain A organization was /notes, the entry in this field would be */notes) . Also list the Domain B server's name (for example, if this is Server1/notes2, the entry in this field is Server1/notes2).
   
   Step 3 will allow server-to-server replication, but will not allow any users in Domain B to access the Domain A server.
