Title: IBM CICS TG  web start and applets report errors due to an expired signer certificate - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 The signer certificate used to sign ctgclient.jar expired on 7th April 2016. 

CONTENT
APAR PI59047 has been opened to document an issue where the certificate used to sign the CICS TG provided ctgclient.jar expired on 7th April 2016. The default security configuration for Java 7 running in a browser changed significantly in the January 2014 CPU (Oracle 7u51, IBM 7 SR6-FP1). If the ctgclient.jar signed by the expired certificate is used in a web start application or applet where this update has been implemented, error messages reporting the expired certificate could be issued. 
The fix is delivered in the following Fix Packs: 

CICS TG release Fix Pack delivering PI59047 V9.1 CICS TG V9.1 Fix Pack 3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039274] V9.0 CICS TG V9.0 Fix Pack 4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034438] V8.1 CICS TG V8.1 Fix Pack 4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032484] V8.0 CICS TG V8 Fix Pack 6 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028200] 
With the relevant fix pack applied the updated ctgclient.jar will be in the <CICS_TG_install_dir>/classes directory. 

If the customer only needs to use the updated ctgclient.jar in a web start application or applet, they can take the ctgclient.jar from the 9.1.0.2-CICSTG-PI59047-1.zip package and apply this to the distributed application. There is no requirement to update the ctgclient.jar in the <CICS_TG_install_dir>/classes directory and, as long as they do not update the ctgclient.jar in the <CICS_TG_install_dir>/classes directory, they do not need to use any of the other JARs in the package. 

Package Notes: 
1/ We have included conftool.jar, ctgadmin.jar, ctgserver.jar and ctgstats.jar for completeness, because these files are required to have the same signer as ctgclient.jar IF they are running in the same JVM as the updated ctgclient.jar, as they do in the Gateway daemon JVM. These JARs are built at the levels stated in the table above and should only be applied to systems at the stated "Built at" level. 

2/ The packages apply to both CICS TG for Multiplatforms or CICS TG Desktop Edition 

3/ cicseci.rar is also included in the package because they also contain signed jars. 

4/ CICS TG for z/OS customers can obtain the updated ctgclient.jar by installing the relevant PTF: CICS TG for z/OS release APAR PTF CICS TG V9.1 PI59167 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI59167] UI36400 CICS TG V9.0 PI59167 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI59167] UI36399 CICS TG V8.1 PI59166 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI59166] UI36407 CICS TG V8.0 PI59166 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI59166] UI36406 RELATED INFORMATION
