take action KT3: stopApplication TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Using ITM TEP GUI Navigator -> Application Management Console -> Robotic scripts -> I select a script -> right mouse click -> Take Action -> Select an action like 'Stop Monitoring Application' and pass as value parameter the correct Application Name. I'm expecting the application to turn red in TEP at some point, but no. Is that normal? 

CAUSE
n/a

ANSWER
Yes, what you are experiencing is expected. When you stop an application, the application is no longer monitored; The robotic script behind the monitoring of such application is simply stopped. By default there is no alert informing that the script playback no longer occurs. So the application will not turn 'red'.

When you stop an application, it leads to the robotic agent simply stopping to playback the script, the robotic profile is stopped and changed. The script disappears from being played, as seen in Robotic Script Playback status workspace.

The application is no longer monitored, but there is no red icon anywhere to inform administrator about the fact that the application was "stopped".

You would need to create your own situation, for example using the Robotic Playback status attribute and somehow verifying if the last run playback occurred more than a certain time ago, and raised an alert if such situation becomes true.
