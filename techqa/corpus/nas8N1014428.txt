To obtain BRMS GUI plug-in debug information, do the following: 

1. Close the IBM iSeries Navigator window. 2. Download the following JETraceOn.reg file to a drive that is accessible from the client PC (for example, C:\).

JETraceOn.reg [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1014428&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1014428&aid=1] 3. Run the JETraceOn.reg file by double-clicking on it from Microsoft Windows Explorer or by typing its file name directly in a command prompt window.

Note: This .reg file creates a registry entry that causes iSeries Navigator to start the Java Console [http://w3.rchland.ibm.com/%7Elpp/brmsGui/customerTips/brmsGuiCustomerSetupAndDebugNotes.htm#JavaConsole]. 4. Start iSeries Navigator. 5. Set the following Java Trace Options:
