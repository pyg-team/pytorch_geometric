Title: IBM Workplace XT Advanced Search times out when combining content and property criteria - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using FileNet Workplace XT advanced searches time out when combining content with property criteria. 

SYMPTOM
Advanced Search using both content and property data does not return results and appears to be hung. It is also possible that the error, A System Error Has Occurred, displays. Note as of Workplace XT version 1.1.5 a more friendly message is propagated to the client where it instead will say; 

This search could not be completed. The server timed out before the search completed. Modify your search criteria to narrow the scope of your search.


CAUSE

Workplace XT 1.1.4 (and prior) has the search conditions ALL, ANY or NEAR to choose between. Workplace XT defaults to ANY which, when it builds the query string, is the same as SQL's 'OR'. This is causing multi-word content searches to be broken in at least 3 separate searches that yield a much higher result-set. For example, searching for the words "Content Management" will search for:

Content
Management
Content Management

Manually changing the search condition from ANY to ALL (which is equivalent to 'AND' when building a SQL string) will search only for 'Content Management' and nothing else thus yielding a more precise result-set.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. When using multi-word in a content contains search select the search condition ALL.



2. Upgrade to Workplace XT 1.1.5 where (using web.xml) we are able to change the default search condition to be ALL instead of ANY. This is not possible in Workplace XT releases prior to 1.1.5.
