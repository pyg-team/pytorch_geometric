APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an user uploads a new file in an IBM SPSS Collaboration and
   Deployment Services (C&DS) repository folder, the owner of the
   folder does not retain their permission, defined via folder
   properties, to the newly added file.
   
   Instead of the folder owner being granted 'Modify' permissions,
   which is assigned to them via the folder properties, they are
   granted 'Read' permissions.
   
   This goes against our current documentation -
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS69YH_7.0.0/cads_man
   ager_ddita/model_management/thick/permissions_copyormove.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS69YH_7.0.0/cads_manager_ddita/model_management/thick/permissions_copyormove.html]
   
   which states:
   
   "Creating resources. When a resource is added to the repository
   (for example, when a new job is created), it inherits the
   permissions of its parent folder; a user with Write permissions
   to a folder he will by default have the same permissions to any
   resources created in it."
   
   The key sentence here is "it inherits the permissions of its
   parent folder".
   
   
   The expected behaviour, according to the description within the
   documentation, is that when a user uploads a file to a specific
   folder within the C&DS repository, the owner of that folder
   would retain their permissions, such as Modify, rather than
   being set the default 'Read' permission.
   
   This was reported using C&DS 7.0-FP1 but can also be replicated
   using C&DS 8.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In order to propagate the Folder Permissions down to the child
   objects and subfolders, right click the Parent folder and select
   Properties.
   
   Switch to the Permissions tab and select the drop-down option:
   Cascade all permissions to all child folders and content. (This
   action only applies once.)
   
   
   Note that doing the above step will remove the ownership of the
   uploaded file from the user who added it to the repository.
