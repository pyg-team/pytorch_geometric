Title: IBM TCR 2.1.1 installation fails - United States

Text:
installation directory not valid; TCR installation fails; error message; provided location; invalid; bitness; TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installing TCR 2.1.1 64bit on an existing TIP immediately fails with error message

"The installation directory you specified is not valid"
"The provided location contains Tivoli Integrated Portal instance with incompatible bit support level" 

CAUSE
If the reused TIP is the one delivered with Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus V7.3.1 Web GUI, it is a 32bit application, so you cannot install TCR 2.1.1 64bit on it.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You have two possible options to solve the issue:

A) if you want to reuse the existing TIP, install the 32bit version of TCR 2.1.1
B) if you want to leverage on 64bit architecture, perform a standalone TCR 2.1.1 installation on another machine.
