ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) document store
   application starts for the first time after you migrate to IBM
   BPM V8.5.5, a number of configuration steps run to enable new
   document store functions. One of these steps corrects the
   permissions on document store objects. If a document store
   authorization is unresolved, this step fails with the following
   exception:
   
   EmbeddedECMIn E   CWTDS1100E: An error occurred while validating
   or creating the default configuration for the IBM BPM document
   store.
   
   com.ibm.bpm.embeddedecm.exception.UnexpectedFailureException:
   CWTDS0000E: An unexpected failure occurred.
   Details: 'FNRCE0051: E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND: The requested item was
   not found.
   Principal
   S-1-98-828663094-926245218-909390893-909389109-959263843-7583960
   02-1647587384-1701209398-1681220404-67108864 not found.'
   
   As a result, the permissions of document store objects are
   inconsistent. When the configuration restarts because the
   document store application starts again upon server start, the
   failed step does not repeat and you encounter another error:
   
   EmbeddedECMIn E   CWTDS1100E: An error occurred while validating
   or creating the default configuration for the IBM BPM document
   store.
   
   com.ibm.bpm.embeddedecm.exception.ObjectDefinitionCannotBeMigrat
   edException: CWTDS0002E: The object definition
   'CustomObject.ObjectDefinitionState' cannot be migrated.
   Details: 'The requester has insufficient access rights to
   perform the requested operation.'
   Explanation: During the migration of a predefined object
   definition for the IBM BPM document store, an unexpected
   exception occurred.
   Action: Check the server log files.
   
   In addition, you observe that the Event Manager has not started
   and IBM Process Center cannot connect to IBM Process Server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  With this fix, the step that corrects the document store
   permissions can be enforced to run when the document store
   application starts.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is/will be available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that ensures the
   step runs that corrects the document store permissions during
   migration. In addition, IBM BPM checks whether the a permission
   is still valid and prevent the first exception from recurring.

   1. Log in to the administrative console and choose All Servers.
   2. For each application target server, complete the following
     steps:
    a. Click Process definition > Java Virtual Machine > Custom
      properties.
    b. Click New.
    c. Name the JVM property as
      "DocumentStoreConfigurationForceFixPermissions" and the value

    d. Click OK and then Save.
   3. Restart the application server.
   
   When the IBM BPM document store application has started without
   errors, remove the custom property, otherwise the document store
   permissions update each time the server starts.
