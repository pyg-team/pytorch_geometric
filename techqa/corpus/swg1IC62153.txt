APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Firmware: 3.7.3.2
   
   When customer reimported  MQ server definition via SOMA, the CPU
   value was triggered to high.
   
   steps to re-create:
   1. Add a new domain "sit01".
   2. In this domain, define a MQ Queue Manager.
   3. Reimport the definitions of this MQ Queue Manager via SOMA.
   Do it several times.
   4. CPU value raises to high and won't go back to normal.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When restart (disable/enable) MQ QM objects, user might
   encounter random cpu spin. This is caused by deadlock of
   resources.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We change a internal call from fork to vfork to avoid deadlock.
   The fix will be in 3.7.1.10, 3.7.2.6, 3.7.3.5
