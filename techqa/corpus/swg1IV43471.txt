APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SOA documentation includes a section detailing how to set up
   .NET DC for use with SOA and TT.

   p?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcamfapps_soa.doc_72%2Fsoa_install_guide%2Fc [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcamfapps_soa.doc_72%2Fsoa_install_guide%2Fc]
   onfigttinterface.html
   We will update the SOA documentation for SOAv7.2 FP1 (due for
   release end July/early August - date to be confirmed) to
   include:
   1. A link to the Transactions documentation detailing a
   procedure for installing .NET DC with TT when SOA .NET dc is
   already installed. The link to TT documentation for this is at:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.js

   p?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3%2Ftt%2Fdita%2Ftask%2Fkto_dom_n [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3%2Ftt%2Fdita%2Ftask%2Fkto_dom_n]
   et_inst_soa.html  (TT 73)
   2. A note to indicate that when both TT and SOA are installed
   .NET DC from one product only should be started.
   In other words, install SOA Agent 7.2 and .NET DC 7.3 in the
   same box: we use .NET DC to collect the events and send them to
   both SOA Agent 7.2 (without SOA DC) and Transaction Collector
   Agent.
   IMPORTANT: When configuring the new converged DC to enable SOA
   integration, as a last step a Config GUI tool will be
   automatically launched. This GUI should be aborted by clicking
   on "Cancel" otherwise the SOA DC will be enabled!
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To enable SOA and TT monitoring of .NET frameworks please
   follow the steps below. This procedure has been verified to be
   correct.
   1. Install KTJ agent v7.3 LA0040 or FP1
   2. Configure KTJ and specify "default.kd4.enabled=true"
   2.1 Stop all .NET based application including IIS (iisreset
   /stop)
   2.2 Modify the dotNetDcConfig.properties.inactive file that is
   located in the CANDLE_HOME\TMAITM6\K4\config directory :
   default.kd4.enabled=true
   2.3 Open the command prompt, and change the path to the bin
   directory:cd
   CANDLE_HOME\TMAITM6\K4\bin
   2.4 Run the configdc activateconfig command
   2.5 Start all .NET based application including IIS (iisreset
   /start)
   3) Install SOA agent v7.2.
   4) Configure the new converged DC to enable SOA integration,
   without enabling the SOA DC. This means that you need to abort
   the last part of the Config Process, by clicking on "Cancel".
