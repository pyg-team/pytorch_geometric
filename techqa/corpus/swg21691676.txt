Title: IBM Error Installing IBM Stewardship Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I ran the InstallGovernanceApplication.sh install_configure_governance_apps step, the script produced the following error in the update_BPM_LoginCSS step: HostName:Port/mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/login/bspace/login.css null (Bad Request)



I have verified that the username and password are valid, and the user ID I specified had full admin rights on our Process Server. Why am I seeing this and how can I circumvent it? 

CAUSE
The error suggests that the user used by the installer does not have appropriate permission to update the webdav folder. Full Error Stack:

ANSWER
The user that has permissions to be execute this interaction can be found in the WAS admin console as shown below: Just log in to the console, click on Resources->Resource Environment->Resource Environment Providers, select the Mashups_ConfigService and then select custom Properties. For convenience, then create a filter and search for MashupAdmin*, and you should see something like the following: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21691676&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21691676&aid=1]


You will need to restart the server for it to take effect. After this the script should complete successfully.
