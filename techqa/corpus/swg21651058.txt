PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You see messages IEW2303E or GIM23911E when applying maintenance to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 or V3.1. This occurs if the XML Toolkit 1.9 member IXM4C56X is not found in dataset SIXMEXP. You recently upgraded to a new release of z/OS and requested the XML Toolkit. 

SYMPTOM
Your GIMSMP APPLY job fails with BINDER message:
IEW2303E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.ieam800/pmbmes.htm#pmbmes] member IXM4C56X of the data set specified by SIXMEXP could not be found.

You might also see message GIM23911E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.gim0000/gimmcd5108.htm].


CAUSE
The XML Toolkit is a separate product that is not included in z/OS base. When you request the Toolkit with a new release of z/OS, like z/OS 1.13, you receive the current release of the Toolkit (1.10) But, XML Toolkit 1.10 does not include the 1.9 libraries and CICS TS 3.2 (and 3.1) have a dependency on XML Toolkit 1.9 modules.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download the V1.9 version of the XML Toolkit from the XML Toolkit for z/OS V1.9 download information [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/tools/xml/download/v19_download.html] or use the V1.9 Toolkit libraries from your own system.

Note: You can avoid getting this error by saving XML Toolkit V1.9 before installing z/OS V1.13 with the XML Toolkit.
