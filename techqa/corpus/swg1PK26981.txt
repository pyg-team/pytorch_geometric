   ****************************************************************
   The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 does not contain information on how to set a
   permanent replyTo property for users using the Java Message
   Service API to transport Web service requests. For users who
   are using Web services with SOAP over JMS, it can be beneficial
   to configure a permanent replyTo queue on the client. This
   process prevents the client from having to use the replyTo
   property for the JMS message each time a Web service request
   is made.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new topic entitled, "Configurating a permanent replyTo queue
   for Web services using SOAP over JMS", has been added to the
   Version 6.1 Information Center. The following information is
   available in this new topic:
   
   When using two-way Web service communications using SOAP over
   JMS, it can be beneficial to configure a permanent replyTo
   queue on a Web services client to prevent the client from
   having to set the JMS message's replyTo property each time a
   Web service request is made.
   
   A permanent replyTo queue can be configured on the Web service
   client in one of two ways. For setting a permanent replyTo
   queue using either of the two options, only client-side
   configuration is necessary. There is no configuration
   necessary on the Web service provider side. The two ways to
   configure a permanent replyTo queue are:
   -Set the replyTo queue programmatically on the client
   JAX-RPC Stub
   -Set the replyTo queue as a JVM System property
   
   Note: By setting the replyTo queue as a JVM system property,
   it will affect all of your SOAP over JMS clients running in
   the particular JVM. If there are multiple clients in the
   same application which need to use a different replyTo
   queue, then the best option would be to set the property
   programmatically.
   
   -Set the replyTo queue programmatically on the client
   JAX-RPC Stub.
   The JAX-RPC Stub is the same Stub which the client uses to
   invoke the Web service.
   
   ((javax.xml.rpc.Stub)stub)._setProperty(com.ibm.wsspi.
   webservices.Constants.JMS_REPLY_QUEUE_JNDI_NAME,
   "jms/Permanent_Q");
   
   The value of the property is a String.
   
   -Set the replyTo queue as a JVM System property.
      -For a Java client invocation, enter at a command prompt
       on one continuous line:
       java -Dcom.ibm.websphere.webservices.
         JMSReplyQueueJndiName=jms/Permanent_Q
      -For a WebSphere Application Server JVM:
       Set a JVM system property using the administrative console
       for the application server which runs the Web service
       client application.
       To set custom properties, connect to the administrative
       console and navigate to the Java virtual machine custom
       properties panel.
       1. Click Servers > Application Servers > server_name >
       Java and Process Management -> Process Definition >
       Java Virtual Machine > Custom Properties > New
       2. Set the Name property to: com.ibm.websphere.
          webservices.JMSReplyQueueJndiName
       3. Set the Value property to: jms/Permanent_Q
       4. Click OK to save your changes.
       5. Click Synchronize changes with Nodes.
       6. Restart the application server.
   
   Your Web services client can now receive SOAP/JMS messages
   to a permanent replyTo queue.
   
   Additional related reference links to this new topic have been
   added to the "Using the Java Message Service API to transport
   Web services requests" and "Web services SOAP/JMS protocol"
   topics.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the next update
   to the Informatin Centers, which is scheduled to occur on or
   before September 30, 2006.
