ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You downloaded the Silent Installer file for the installation of
   IBM SPSS Statistics 24 on Macintosh.
   The version you downloaded was the refreshed media posted on
   passport Advantage on 23. June 2016, part number CND2FML:
   IBM SPSS Statistics Client 24.0 Mac OS Silent Multilingual
   (CND2FML)
   Size 1,457MB, Date posted: 23 June 2016
   As a prerequisite you need to have a working License Manager
   8.6.1 (Concurrent licensing Tools 9.6) installation on any host
   the Mac Client can connect to.
   The file you will download is SPSS_Statistics_24_mac_silent.dmg
   You put the file on a Mac desktop and extract the contents
   The files you have after extraction are
   SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin and installer.properties
   You create a new folder on desktop and copy both files into the
   new folder.
   On this folder open installer.properties file in TextEdit.app
   and change LSHOST name to the IP address of the host where you
   have installed the license manager
   For example LSHOST=10.142.201.199
   You do not change any of the other properties in
   installer.properties file (only LSHOST) and save the file with
   same name
   Next, open Terminal.app and change directory to the folder where
   you put SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin and installer.properties
   file
   Start the silent installation from this folder with command
   below
   Sudo ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin -f installer.properties
   When prompted enter your password
   Wait until installer is ready.
   Then open Finder and go to release 24 installation directory on
   this Mac. The content looks good.
   Right click on SPSSStatistics and select Show package content.
   Then go to Contents - Bin folder and open lservrc. The file is
   empty which is correct.
   Then, open file spssprod.inf file in a text Editor and look for
   the DaemonHost value.
   Current behavior:
   On file spssprod.inf you see DaemonHost=no-net which is not
   correct.
   Instead there should be the LSHOST=IP address (or host name) of
   the Sentinel license manager host you entered on
   installer.properties file
   Consequently, when you now launch SPSS 24 on this Mac it says
   IBM SPSS Statistics has expired and will stop functioning. On
   Output Viewer you see license error 7001 - symptom 18 "There is
   no license for SPSS Statistics".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround please enter the daemonhost value in
   spssprod.inf manually to reflect the Sentinel LM host name and
   save the file with the same name.
   Then SPSS 24 will launch properly and get a license token from
   the License manager.
   This issue will be addressed in a future release of IBM SPSS
   Statistics.
