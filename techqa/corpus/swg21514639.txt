PROBLEM
 Attempts to install and uninstall Webform Server 4.0 result in a failed install with an ACUINI0082E error when using IBM Forms 64-bit version on a AIX 64-bit operating system.

SYMPTOM
 When trying to install, the following exception displays in the FormsServerInstall-00.log:
2011-05-18 17:02:00.225-04:00 : STDERR : com.ibm.ac.si.install.RegisterCmdFailedException: ACUINI0082E The register or deregister request has failed. ClassName: com.ibm.ac.si.tpreg.TouchpointRegistryImpl and Options:[Ljava.lang.String;@614c614c.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Manually clean up the previous install by removing the installation directory and all the child files and directories. 

 

Manual Clean up steps: 

** Note: Make sure you remove all directories, files and child directories from the installation path. Remove any .lock files. 

1. Remove the /var/ibm/common directory. 

2. Remove the /usr/ibm/common directory. 

3. Clean up the /tmp directory, by removing the acu_de.log file , if it is there. The installer may leave some additional folders in /tmp as well, check for persistent_state, StdErr.txt and hsperdata_<username> from the /tmp and delete them before install 

4. Remove the /tmp/<username> directory, where <username> is the ID of the user that installed DE (e.g. "root"). 

5. Remove all DE references from the /etc/inittab system file. The DE entries should be delimited by "#Begin AC Solution Install block" and "#End AC Solution Install block". Remove all of the text between these delimiters, and the delimiting text, as well. 

6. Remove all DE references from the /etc/services system file. 

Also clean up any forms file items left in the following locations: 

 install location = /usr/ibm/common/acsi 

 common location = /var/ibm/common/acsi 

 

Prior to attempting a reinstall, verify the 32 and 64 bit libraries are on the AIX machine. Details of the files are found in technote 1474222 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474222].
