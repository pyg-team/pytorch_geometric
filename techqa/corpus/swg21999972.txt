QUESTION
 How does IBM Content Collector (ICC) create a secured connection with the active directory for the Microsoft Exchange environment? 

CAUSE
IBM Content Collector for Email needs to establish a connection with the active directory before it can archive any emails from the Exchange environment. 

LDAP connection fails when using the port 636 (LDAP port over SSL/TLS) and 3289 (global catalog port over SSL/TLS). 


ANSWER
 

 * To create a secured connection with the active directory, ICC uses STARTTLS on the unsecured port (i.e. 389 for LDAP and 3268 for global catalog). 
 * For more details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS]. 
 * If you require SSL/TLS connection between ICC and active directory, in ICC configuration manager, Connectors > Email > Active Directory, continue to use the unsecured port 389 and 3268. 
 * In the email connector sysout log, you can see this INFO level message and verify that it is using TLS connection:
