Title: IBM Issue when exporting the deployment list from Event Builder 5.0: the deploy *.csv displays garbled Japanese when opened in Excel - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working in Event Builder 5.0 J as we are trying to build a Japanese demo version of EB. I exported the optimization list (Deployment table) for my Japanese optimization scenario via *.csv. in Event Builder with no errors. However, when I open the file in Excel the Japanese is all garbled.

If I open the file in Notepad it displays just fine. Now, if I save the file with UTF-8 encoding then the Japanese displays OK when I re-open the file in Excel.

There appears to be an encoding issue with with the *.csv file. The garbled Japanese should not happen. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development. However, there are no plans by development to fix this issue. Please use the following workaround below:

Opening the csv file in text editor and resaving the file. Opening it again in Excel will get rid of the garbled Japanese characters. 

For details please see the procedures below:
1. Open the csv file in a text editor like NotePad and you find the Japanese displays just fine.
2. In text editor re-save the file (either a simple save or Save As and selecting the encoding UTF-8)
3. Start Excel and open the csv file by File>>Open And select the file format to "Text files (*.prn; *.txt; *.csv)"
4. Follow the Text file wizard to import the data correctly. The Japanese characters will display correctly
5. Save the csv file again in Excel
