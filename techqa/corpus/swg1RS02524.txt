APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When pasting a negative value with operator, like "<-9", into a
   decision table cell in Business Console, cell is in error (
   unknown word <). Sometimes an "Unexpected error" is shown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In order to have the values properly formatted, you can
   copy/paste from the DT into Excel instead of using the Download
   feature.
   
   Ex: open the DT, Press CTRL-A to select all + Copy
   Then in Excel: paste, edit, copy, and paste back into BC
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is the formatting of a cell with an operator and a
   negative value.
   We need to fix the formatting when we generate the Excel file
   for download.
   When you specify a format in Excel like '"<" General', for a
   value of -9, it will produce:
   -< 9 (instead of < -9) It puts the minus sign before the <
   operator. Quite unexpected ...
   In that case, the decision table is enable to recognize the
   operator when you paste this kind of value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
