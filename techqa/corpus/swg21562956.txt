QUESTION
 How to install WebSphere MQ version 7.0.x (or higher) jars in SI/GIS 

ANSWER


To install MQ 7.0.x(or higher) jar files in SI/GIS, all jar files located beneath the directory of the WebSphere your_install_dir/java/lib 
MUST be run through the install3rdparty script, not just the com.ibm.mq.jar file as noted in the section ‘Installing the WebSphere MQ Adapter’ 
at the documentation located in the Sterling SI/GIS official documentation. A formal documentation update will be forth coming. 
This only includes the jar files contained in the WebSphere your_install_dir/java/lib directory, but not any subdirectories beneath /lib.

The jar files to be installed as third party files vary with the different versions of WebSphere MQ.
You can view the list of jar files from your_install_dir/java/lib on the WebSphere MQ server. For MQ version 7.0.x and above,
all jar files contained in the WebSphere your_install_dir/java/lib directory should be installed using the SI/GIS install3rdParty utility.

Note: The WebSphere MQ adapter may work with previous versions of the WebSphere MQ classes for Java,
however it was designed for use with the version 5.3.x or higher. In all cases, the version of the WebSphere MQ jar file(s)
installed to the application MUST match the version running on the WebSphere MQ server.


PREREQUISITES:
The instructions below assume all of the following prerequisites have been met:
-SterlingIntegrator/GentranIntegrationSuite has viable database & file system backups
-The SI/GIS user account that the application runs with is the account performing the below instructions
-The WebSphere MQ Server is accessible to obtain the MQ 7.0.x (or higher) files necessary for the install



INSTRUCTIONS:
To install the WebSphere MQ adapter (below version 7.0.x):

1) From the computer where the WebSphere MQ server is installed, copy the com.ibm.mq.jar file to a directory on your local server.

2) From the directory on your local server, copy the com.ibm.mq.jar file to a directory on the host computer where Application is installed.

3) Shut down SI/GIS if it is running.

4) From the bin directory where SI/GIS is installed, install the vendor library package (com.ibm.mq.jar) by running
the install3rdParty script. Use the WebSphere MQ server version number and the path and name of the
directory that you used in step 2 to enter commands similar to the following examples:


 * 
 * On a UNIX\Linux system, enter:
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 5_3 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jar
   
   
 * 
 * On a Windows system, enter:
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 5_3 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jar



5) Restart Application.



To install the WebSphere MQ adapter (above version 7.0.x):

1) From the computer where the WebSphere MQ server is installed, copy ALL the jar files in the your_install_dir/java/lib directory
to a directory on your local server. No files located in subdirectories beneath the WebSphere your_install_dir/java/lib location need to be copied over.

2) From the directory on your local server, copy the jar files to a directory on the host computer where SI/GIS is installed.

3) Shut down SI/GIS if it is running.

4) From the bin directory where SI/GIS is installed, install ALL the vendor library packages by running the install3rdParty
script included with the application. Use the WebSphere MQ server version number and the path and name of the directory that was used
in step 2 to enter commands similar to the following examples (Please note: the exact names & number of the
vendor's filenames appearing in the list below may vary):


 * 
 * On a UNIX\Linux system, enter:
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.defaultconfig.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.fta.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.headers.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jms.Nojndi.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.postcard.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.soap.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.tools.ras.jar
   
   install3rdParty.sh ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mqetclient.jar
   
   
   
 * 
 * On a Windows system, enter:
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.defaultconfig.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.fta.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.headers.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.jms.Nojndi.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.postcard.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.soap.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mq.tools.ras.jar
   
   install3rdParty.cmd ibm 7_0 -j directory/com.ibm.mqetclient.jar
   
   

5) Restart Application.

 

VERIFICATION:
There is currently no successful completion message upon successfully applying the jar files.
To verify the install3rdParty update applied to the product successfully, open the property files in your SI/GIS install directory here:
/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg.in
/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg

and confirm several entries of 
VENDOR_JAR=\some\file\path\some.ibm.mq.jarfile.jar

that match the jar files applied in the instructions above.
