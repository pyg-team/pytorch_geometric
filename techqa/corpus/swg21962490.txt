Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Internet Explorer 11 with EP 10.1.1 FP4 even though it is a supported configuration the error:

Object doesn't support property or method 'createNSResolver' would occur when opening a Contributor Application. 

SYMPTOM
Component error: 
(0x800a01b6) 
Component description: 
Object doesn't support property or method 'createNSResolver' 
Script catching error: 
planning12.js::errorCheckThrow 
Loading this page: 
Error definitions XML: errorLookupStringsAtClient: Object doesn't support property or method 'evaluate'



All other errors/error stack: 
(errorServerReturnedError) planning12.js::errorCheckThrow 
(errorCatch) planning00.htm::continueLoad:catch 



CAUSE
IE 11 will work with planning but not in the default (Edge) mode.
Compatibility mode needs to be use instead.

ENVIRONMENT
EP 10.1.1 FP3 or FP4 with IE 11

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the error occurs, go to Compatibility View Settings in IE and add the Contributor page to the list.
