APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If there are many subdirectories with names that consist of
   digits only (for example "2", "12", or "102") in the %TEMP%
   directory, the IBM Content Collector Web Application service
   might not start. An error similar to the following is reported
   in the SystemOut.log file:
   
   0000000e ThreadMonitor W   WSVR0605W: Thread "server.startup :
   2" (0000000a) has been active for 714888 milliseconds and may be
   hung.  There is/are 2 thread(s) in total in the server that may
   be hung.

   der.java:140)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete all subdirectories with names that consist of digits only
    (for example "2", "12", or "102") in the %TEMP% directory.
   Then, restart the Web Application service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM Content Collector Web Application service runs into a
   loop when the Document Viewer attempts to create a temporary
   directory that already exists. This problem occurs more
   frequently if there are many subdirectories with names that
   consist of digits in the %TEMP% directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 2.2.0.5 and 3.0.0.5, IBM
   Content Collector deletes the temporary directories after use,
   so that the %TEMP% directory does not fill up. As a result, the
   web application server can be started successfully.
