 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You can configure Rational DOORS for integration with another Requirements Management (RM) application, such as Rational DOORS Next Generation, by using Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC). When linking between an object in a Rational DOORS module and an artifact in the other RM application, a scripting error might occur if you choose the option to create a linked artifact in the remote application. 

SYMPTOM
When creating a linked artifact, an error similar to the following might occur:


An error has occurred in the script on this page
Line: 99
Char: 2198
Error: Unable to get value of the property 'getRanges': object is null or undefined
Code: 0
URL: https//server_name.example.com:8443/dwa/ckeditor/ckeditor.js
Do you want to continue running scripts on this page? Yes/No

CAUSE
This problem is caused by a known problem in the CKEditor for Microsoft Internet Explorer 7: http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/7968 [http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/7968] 



ENVIRONMENT
Server operating system: Windows Server 2003
Client operating system: Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To reproduce the problem: 

 1. In the Rational DOORS client, click File > OSLC > Remote Services. Add the RM application server and the required collaboration link types. 
 2. In Rational DOORS module, select any of the RM link types, and select Create artifact. 
 3. Complete the steps to create the artifact and click Finish.


The error is displayed. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is no way to prevent the display of the error message in this scenario. However, if you clickYesorNoin response to the error, the artifact and link are created.
Workaround: Create artifacts in the remote RM application. Create links directly to the existing artifacts.
