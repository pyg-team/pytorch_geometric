ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Rapid Deploy generates an incorrect Looseconfig.xmi
   file when Web projects specify Web Library Projects in RAD 6.
   This means that the Library Projects are not actually on the
   WebSphere Classpath at runtime. In this case it manifested as
   a failure to find a JSP helper class when the JSP was compiled
   at runtime
   PK05702 is the WebSphere Application Server equivalent APAR
