APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a long-running address space opens a VSAM cluster,
   performs some updates and then closes the VSAM cluster
   another non-CICS address space may open the same VSAM cluster.
   However, if this VSAM cluster is defined for replication logging
   the logging fails with DWW252I with return code 24 and reason
   code 717053CB and DWW280I with return code 8 and reason
   code 71725319.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects CICS VR 5.1 and 5.2 users  *
   *                 that exploit VSAM replication logging.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Currently replication logging for a     *
   *                      VSAM sphere is not supported            *
   *                      simultaneously from multiple non-CICS   *
   *                      address spaces.                         *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   This APAR provides an enhancement for VSAM batch replication
   logging:
   If a VSAM sphere is defined for VSAM batch replication logging
   only (without forward recovery or batch backout logging,i.e. as
   LOGREPLICATE,FRLOG(NONE)), CICS VR will disconnect the sphere
   from the replication log at VSAM CLOSE operations, not at end
   of job step. This allows a second job to perform replication
   logging once the first job has completed the CLOSE even though
   the first job has not yet completed. It is still the case that
   only one job at a time can have the file open with replication
   logging active.
   In this scenario, the logstream contains only replication log
   records for use by the IIDR for VSAM for z/OS product. It
   cannot be used by CICS VR forward recovery and batch backout
   utilities.
