VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2012-5783 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5783]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Commons HttpClient, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79984 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79984] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0227 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0227]
DESCRIPTION: Apache WSS4J could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements property. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using various types of wrapping attacks to bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100837 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100837] for the current score

DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

DESCRIPTION: OpenSAML could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when parsing XML entities. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted XML document containing external entity references, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
