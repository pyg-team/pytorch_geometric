ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This customer has configured a CICS RAR resource at the node
   scope.  The servers on this node are part of a cluster.  When he
   deploys his application at the cluster level he receives the
   following message:
   .
   ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope.  Resources are within
   the deployment target scope if they are defined at the cell,
   node, server, or application level when the deployment target is
   a server, or at the cell, cluster, or application level when the
   deployment target is a cluster. Assign resources that are within
   the deployment target scope of the application or confirm that
   these resources assignments are correct as specified.

   ****************************************************************
   While deploying an application using the Administrative Console
   with Resource Validation, after mapping the resources a customer
   might see validation errors stating that the mapped resources
   are out of scope even if the resources that are mapped belong
   to the correct scope. The problem is that the validation logic
   incorrectly sets the resource to be out of scope before actually
   verifying the scope at which the resource is declared.
   The following validation error message can be observed in the
   next screen:
   ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope.
   
   This problem was introduced by APAR PK23311 in WebSphere
   Application Server 6.0.2.17.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been modified to correct the validation logic to
   ensure the correct scope of the resource is taken into
   consideration before throwing the validation errors.
   
   APAR PK56028 is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
   Level (Fix Pack) 6.0.2.27 of WebSphere Application Server
   V6.0.1.
