HOW CRITICAL IS THIS FIX?
This is a recommended fix for IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise v3.7.0.



PROBLEMS SOLVED
The following problems have been addressed with IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise v3.7.0.1. 

 * The filter bar text fields no longer change width depending on the input. The width is now adapted to be the view width. 
 * When duplicating a scenario, the goal importance factor of one of the goals was set to its default value even if it had been modified. 
 * Domain object model modifications performed on a single row table are no longer persisted to the scenario. 
 * The setting of transaction isolation on external data sources has now been suppressed as some drivers do not support this. 
 * The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is now prevented from being raised, in the rare case where it had previously occurred, when clicking on the header of the column. 
 * DB2 sequences now use bigint sequences instead of int sequences in order to have a larger maximum limit. 
 * A copied date or time in a table cell previously did not display correctly in editing mode. 
 * Previously, when you entered a time in a table cell by selecting a time offered in the drop-down list available in editing mode, the displayed time in the table cell was not correctly displayed. 
 * Previously, numbers formatted in the ODM Enterprise IDE, for example with comma separators or alphabetical characters, were displayed formatted in the Studio view, which made it impossible to exit the editing mode. This has now been fixed so that all characters are now displayed without formatting in the editing mode, but the formatting can be still seen in the Studio view. 
 * Previously, IloDomModelChangeEvent.getElementaryUpdateCount(...) might have returned an incorrect count. 
 * Updates to DOM objects mapped to a single row table were not persisted. 
 * Previously, aborting a custom task quickly, sometimes led to an exception. 
 * Previously, aborting the custom solve task of the ObjectModelCustomTask sample quickly, sometimes led to a crash. 
 * Now, cycles in derived tables are detected at runtime and an error message is displayed mentioning the tables involved in the cycle. 
 * Exceptions are no longer raised in case of multiple Multi Scenario Views.


KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS
Upgrades existing installations of IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise v3.7.0 to v3.7.0.1.



CHANGE HISTORY
The following enhancements have been added to IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise v3.7.0.1. 



ODM Enterprise Perspective. The ODM Enterprise IDE now opens with the ODM Enterprise perspective as the default.

New Java Project. When creating new projects in the ODM Enterprise IDE, you can now specify a name and location for an associated Java project at the same time. A new section has been added to the New Project window.

Java tasks in the Decision Process Control editor. You can now use a new option to generate the associated implementation class for Java tasks in the Implementation tab of the Decision Process Control editor. 

Scenarios Overview. The Scenarios Overview view has been enhanced. You can switch between tree view or new table view of scenarios. Additional properties can be displayed for each scenario such as the last modified date, or who it was modified by. The Scenarios Overview window is now floatable so that it can be viewed on a separate monitor away from other views, freeing up your screen space.

ODM Application Branding. You can now customize some of the visual elements in an ODM application. 

Exporting the OPL model in clear text. By using a new option in the Deployment Descriptor editor, you can now package your .mod files in your ODM application's .odmapp files in clear text, rather than in their compiled form. This can be useful for debugging purposes. 

Engine and server logging enhancement. You can now control engine logs using the java.util.logging category ilog.odm.optimcore . Task logs running on server can now be retrieved from the server console. You can now easily control task log levels at the server, application or task level. For more information see Log files with Optimization Server.

Lazy table creation. Database tables are now physically created in the database on the first update. This improves scenario creation time and defers the physical creation time to the first table update. Communication with data server is now improved as only created tables require server access. Lazy table creation is activated by default, but it can be disabled using the repository property MATERIALIZE_TABLE_LAZY (see IloRepositoryProperties).

Concurrency performance has been improved when accessing data from data server cache.

Triggers. It is now possible to execute triggers that will execute at each transaction and that can continue to update the object model as part of the current transaction.

Management of action icons. A new section in the online documentation has been added which explains how you can manage small and large icons for actions. 

Better performance with garbage collection and memory management. Instructions for using the -Xdisableexplicitgc option are provided in the online documentation to help you to improve performance with large volumes of data.
