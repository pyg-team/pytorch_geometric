APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Please open an apar with the following severity and information:
   Severity: 3
   Approver:PB
   Compid: 5724C04LN
   Abstract: False positives from situation on Linux File Pattern
   group
   Environment: The Monitoring Agent for Linux OS 6.2.3
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Situations defined against the File Pattern attribute group may
   trigger false alerts when applied to large files.
   
   Due to a lack in controlling the timeout for the underlying grep
    command that the OS agent spawns for the Linux File Pattern
   group, the Match Count attribute may evaluate as Not Collected
   (-2) if a timeout does occur. If this condition is not permanent
    and a subsequent query returns a valid Match Count, situations
   based on Match Count delta function will trigger even if Match
   Count did not really change.
   
   In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment, a new environment variable has been added. See the
   "Install Actions" section of the APAR conclusion for more
   details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Introduced new environment variable KLZ_GREP_TIMEOUT with
   default value 5 seconds, minimum allowed value 3 seconds and
   maximum value 30 seconds. Increasing the timeout should mitigate
    the occurrence of above described cases.
   
   Install Actions:
   Set the environment variable KLZ_GREP_TIMEOUT in the Monitoring
   Agent for Linux OS configuration file.
