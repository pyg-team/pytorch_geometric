PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When deploying a SOAP Web Service to v2.6 of the IBM IWS server, the web service endpoint URL has changed. This document explains why. 

SYMPTOM
When deploying a SOAP web service to a v2.6 IWS server, an extra layer is added to the web service endpoint URL in comparison to previous IWS server versions (1.3 and 1.5).


ENVIRONMENT
IBM i OS

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When upgrading to IBM i 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, you may need to migrate and deploy your SOAP web services to a new IBM Integrated Web Services (IWS) server version; moving from v1.3 or v1.5 to v2.6. In doing this, you will notice the endpoint URL for the SOAP web service will change. 


NOTE: This will only affect SOAP web services. 


For example: 

v1.3/v1.5 URL: http://as400:20102 /web/services/myService 

v2.6 URL: http://as400:20102 /web/services/myServiceService/myService 

where myService is the name of the SOAP web service being deployed. 

As you can see, the v2.6 URL contains an extra layer in the path. The change in the URL is the result of an upgrade to the underlying application server runtime to use the WebSphere Application Server Liberty product. Unfortunately, the URL change was necessary as part of the upgrade and is working as designed.

Since the SOAP web service endpoint URL has changed, clients will need to redistribute their SOAP web service's WSDL file to their SOAP web service clients and/or inform the clients of the new HTTP/HTTPS Endpoint URL for the SOAP-based services after upgrading to an IWS v2.6 server.
