APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The fix adds extra checking to the ncp_virtualdomain process so
   that a backup virtual domain process only sends a failure event
   for the primary domain if all it's processes are running, it
   hasn't received a status event from the primary domain and the
   new extra check that it has also received a status event for
   itself to ensure the eventing system is operatonal on the
   backup server.
