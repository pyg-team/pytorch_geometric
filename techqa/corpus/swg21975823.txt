The new JREs that are supplied by the above fixes resolve the CVE-2015-7575 (SLOTH) vulnerability. 

Note that CSS 5.1 uses Java 6 and has issued a patch. 
CSS 5.2.0 and CSS 5.2.1 use Java 8 and are not issuing a patch at this time because the vulnerability can be eliminated as follows: 

For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA


Note: If you install a Java fix pack, that will overwrite the above java.security file changes.
