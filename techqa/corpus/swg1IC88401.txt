APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using monitoring, events are published as non persistent
   and there is no way in WebSphere MQ to make these events
   persistent.
   
   This APAR will change monitoring to publish the events using
   the "persistent as topic" option instead of non persistent.
   Customers will be able to configure a topic under MQ to change
   the persistence of the message.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker who use monitoring and
   want to change the persistence of monitoring messages to be
   persistent.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Event monitor messages are currently published as non persistent
   messages to WebSphere MQ.
   There is no way for a user to change the persistence to
   persistent messages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to change the
   persistence of monitor messages to use persistence as per
   topic instead of non persistent.
   It does not change the current persistence of monitoring
   messages unless a customer defines a topic name in WebSphere
   MQ that matches the monitoring topic and makes that topic
   persistent.
