APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Configuring the hang detection policy" topic for
   WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 is missing the name
   of a custom property. Under the section for name value pairs,
   the following information exists in the topic:
   
   Name:
   Value: The number of times (T) that false alarms can occur
   before automatically increasing the threshold. It is possible
   that a thread that is reported as hung eventually completes
   its work,resulting in a false alarm. A large number of
   these events indicates that the threshhold value is too small.
   The hang detection facility can automatically respond to this
   situation: For every T false alarms, the threshold T is
   increased by a factor of 1.5. Set the value to zero (or less)
   to disable the automatic adjustment.
   Default: 100
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Need to add in the value for:
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.false.alarm.threshold

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In the "Configuring the hang            *
   *                      detection policy" topic for WebSphere   *
   *                      Application Server Version 6.1, one     *
   *                      of the custom properties is missing     *
   *                      from the documentation. The topic       *
   *                      contains information that describes a   *
   *                      custom property and states "The         *

   *                      considered hung. " However, the name    *
   *                      of this custom property is not listed.  *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.threshold custom property
   is missing from the "Configuring the hang detection policy"
   topic.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuring the hang detection policy" topic for
   WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 will be updated. The
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.threshold custom property name
   will be added to the topic. With the change, the following
   information will exist for this custom property:
   
   Name:
   com.ibm.websphere.threadmonitor.false.alarm.threshold
   Value:
   The number of times (T) that false alarms can occur before
   automatically increasing the threshold. It is possible that a
   thread that is reported as hung eventually completes its work,
   resulting in a false alarm.  A large number of these events
   indicates that the threshhold value is too small. The hang
   detection facility can automatically respond to this
   situation: For every T false alarms, the threshold T is
   increased by a factor of 1.5. Set the value to zero (or less)
   to disable the automatic adjustment.
   Default: 100
   
   Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our

   current documentation before you read this text. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the December
   2008 update to the Information Centers.
