Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Cannot launch FileNet P8 Process Configuration Console (PCC) via Workplace XT (XT). Getting java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. 

SYMPTOM
Successfully install P8 4.5.1.x on Windows 2008 using WorkplaceXT. Attempt to launch FileNet P8 Process Configuration Console (PCC) and get java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class filenet.ws.listener.utils.WSListenerProperties


CAUSE
The FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE) and P8 WorkplaceXT (XT) were installed/deployed on the same java virtual machine; in other words the same application server instance.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Uninstall XT from the JBoss application server hosting the CE. 
 2. Create new JBoss application server to host XT. 
 3. Use scripts under <XT_install_path>/deploy directory to recreate the WAR and EAR files. 
 4. Install/deploy newly created XT EAR file to newly created JBoss application server.

You should now be able to successfully launch the PCC.
