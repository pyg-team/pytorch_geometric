RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document explains how to collect data for issues with the IAS/LWI/Web Services Servers. Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

Integrated Application Server (IAS)/ Lightweight Interface (LWI) Server/ Web Services Server specific MustGather information

If you encounter an issue when accessing your IAS/LWI/Web Services Server, you should collect the following information when the internal application server and/or application(s) are experiencing the problem: 

1. Execute and gather the lwicollector tool and output.
Appendix A. How to execute and gather the lwicollector tool and output. 2. Follow the instructions to collect and send the data into IBM Support.
Appendix B. How to collect and send diagnostic information to IBM Support. For a listing of all technotes, downloads, and educational materials specific to the IBM i Server components, search the Support for IBM System i Web site at the following URL:

   1. If the QMGTOOLS library has not yet been installed, you should refer to the following document for information on how to download and install the QMGTOOLS toolkit on your IBM i server. http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011297 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011297] 2. ADDLIBLE QMGTOOLS 3. LWICOL HTTP_INST(<INSTANCE>) FTP_RSP(Y) PMR(55555) BRANCH(555) COUNTRY(555) EMAIL_ADDR('YOUREMAIL@COMPANY.COM')
   
   where <INSTANCE> is the name of your IAS/IWS server
   
   *The above command will run for 5-15 minutes and will automatically FTP the /tmp/collectorscripts/data/<instance>collector.zip file to ecurep and forward it to the PMR number noted. If the local IBM i does not have FTP access, it will fail to upload, and the zip file will need to be uploaded manually to

         Important Note: You must have a PMR created to complete these steps. 
         1. Prepare your files for transfer: 
         
         a. You should compress (if possible) each file, or multiple files, into one zip archive. This will speed up the transfer process and make the overall process easier. 
         b. Rename your file(s) prior to transfer. Use the following file naming convention to name your file: 
         
         Caution: The file must use this format to be associated with the PMR; this is the complete PMR record number. Using any other file name will cause the file to be deleted. 
         Enter your PMR record information and file type as follows: 
         xxxxx.bbb.ccc.yyy.zzz 
         
         where: 
         xxxxx = PMR number 
         bbb = Branch 
         ccc = Country code 
         yyy = Unique file name 
         zzz = File type or file extension 
         
         Example 
         
         12345.055.000.collector01_29_Aug_06.zip 
         
         2. From a command prompt, terminal window, or FTP client, FTP to the following site: 
         
         ftp testcase.boulder.ibm.com 
         
         3. Log in as anonymous. 
         
         NOTE: At some point in time, IBM will remove anonymous login. Refer to this URL for information to obtain an IBM ID and password.
