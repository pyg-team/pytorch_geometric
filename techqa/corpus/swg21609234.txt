Also NullPointerException(NPE) with following stack is logged on portal server side when the problem occurs:

How do you solve the problem? 

CAUSE
This is known issue and Fixed in Fix Pack 1. 

If the user already logged into the search application on ICA server side, the user's configuration is once stored at ICA side then shared when the user uses the search portlet on Portal server side. Then, ICA V3.0 GA's search portlet mishandles the configuration information, then as a result above error occurs.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade the search portlet to the one bundled with ICA with ES Version 3.0 Fix Pack 1.
