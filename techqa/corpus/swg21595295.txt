PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the probe log file, I am receiving an error "Read from the server has timed out." and "Connection to object server 'NCOMS' marked DEAD ! " 

SYMPTOM
The probe is receiving a read timeout error this time, this means the Object Server has not responded to the probe request before the NetworkTimeout probe property. 

2012-05-04T13:12:54: Error: E-UNK-000-000: ct_results(): user api layer internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out. 

2012-05-04T13:12:54: Error: E-UNK-000-000: ct_results(): network packet layer: internal net library error: Net-lib operation timed out OS Error: Operating System Error - 0 

2012-05-04T13:12:54: Error: E-UNK-000-000: Connection to object server 'NCOMS' marked DEAD ! 
2012-05-04T13:12:54: Error: E-UNK-000-000: Results processing failed. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The NetworkTimeout should be increased to prevent these probe disconnections when the Object Server is busy. The NetworkTimeout should be set to a value higher than 10 seconds to allow the Object Server client heartbeat to keep the probe connected. The default client heartbeat rate from the Object Server is 10 seconds. 

The PollServer property should always be higher than the network timeout or the probe will not be able to send events properly when it is failed over to a backup Object Server. 

With the settings below, the probe will wait 30 seconds for a response from the object Server before the connection times out. When the probe is connected to a Backup Object Server, it will attempt to reconnect to the primary Object Server every 60 seconds, wait for 30 seconds to determine the Object Server is unavailable, and then connect to the Backup Object Server to send events. 

 
NetworkTimeout : 30 
PollServer : 60
