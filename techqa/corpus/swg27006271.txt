Hardware Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1]  * Linux for iSeries and pSeries: 64-bit iSeries and pSeries IBM POWER processor-based systems only, capable of running the required level of a compatible operating system with enough storage to meet the combined requirements of the programming prerequisites, WebSphere MQ, the access methods and the application programs.

Databases [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1] Where IBM WebSphere MQ is acting as the transaction manager.
 * DB2 Universal Database V8.2 [see note 1] 
 * IBM DB2 V9.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows (JDBC/XA not supported) [see note 2]

Compilers [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1]  * GNU C Compiler (gcc) and g++ V3.2 
 * GNU C Compiler (gcc) and g++ V3.3 
 * GNU C Compiler (gcc) and g++ V3.4 [see note 7] 
 * GNU C Compiler (gcc) and g++ V4.1 [see note 7] 
 * Micro Focus Server Express V4.0 (COBOL) 
 * Micro Focus Server Express V5.0 (COBOL) 
 * Micro Focus Server Express V5.1 (COBOL) [see note 11] 

Connectivity [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1]  * IBM Communications Server for Linux V6.2 
 * TCP/IP (IPv4 and IPv6 provided by the operating system)

Transaction Manager [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1] Where one of these products is acting as the transaction manager and IBM WebSphere MQ is acting as a resource manager, it's recommended that you contact the transaction manager vendor in the first instance for support. 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.1 or later Fix Pack (for SLES V9 only) 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.0.1 or later 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V6.0.2 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307212&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more information) 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V6.1 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307203&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more information) 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the WebSphere Application Server client container, V7.0 (see this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&dc=DB540&uid=swg21316899&loc=en_US&cs=UTF-8&lang=en&rss=ct171websphere] for more information)

SOAP Support [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1]  * IBM 32-bit or 64-bit SDK for Linux for iSeries and pSeries, Java 2 Technology Edition V1.4.2 (supported on pSeries only, supplied with WebSphere MQ) 
 * Apache Axis V1.1 (supplied with WebSphere MQ) 

Cryptography Cards [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006271&amp;aid=1] Refer to the Cryptography Card List for WebSphere MQ v6 and v7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&context=SSFKSJ&context=SSEP7X&q1=cryptography&uid=swg21326434&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] document for further information.  

Notes: 

 1.  JDBC/XA usage is not supported on this platform. 
 2.  Only 64-bit DB2 instances can be used with 64-bit WebSphere MQ. 
 3.  WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.0 or later is required. 
 4.  For details of the Support Statement for JCA (on WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.1 or later only) please see here. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27009524] 
 5.  WMQ Fix Pack 6.0.2.3 or later is required. 
 6.  Defect support is available for virtualisation environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualisation environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualisation environment itself. 
 7.  On Linux platforms, if you need to use SSL in a C++ MQ application then you must link the application against the libstdc++.so.5 runtime library. This is because the version of the GSkit SSL libraries supplied with MQ depends on libstdc++.so.5 and this GSkit version is not compatible with other C++ runtime library versions. MQ C++ applications built against the GCC 3.2 or 3.3 C++ runtime libraries comply with this restriction and will be able to use SSL. 
 8.  WMQ Fix Pack 6.0.2.5 or later is required. 
 9.  SELinux must be disabled. 
 10. WMQ Fix Pack 6.0.2.6 or later is required. 
 11. WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 or later is required. 
 12. Defect support is available for Linux environments that are fully compatible - both source and binary - with Red Hat Enterprise Linux V5. Unless stated otherwise, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in such compatible environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the linux environment itself.
     If issues arise that are related to the compatible linux environment, the user may need to contact the linux environment vendor for support, or the issue may need to be recreated inside an environment tested by IBM in order to receive WebSphere MQ support.
