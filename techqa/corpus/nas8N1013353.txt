Text:
MESSAGES TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document discusses how to remove all messages in the system operator message queue (QSYSOPR) except unanswered inquiry and unanswered senders' copy messages by invoking the Remove Nonprogram Messages (QMHRMVM) API from the command line or within a CL program. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Tired of using DSPMSG MSGQ(QSYSOPR) and pressing F16 just to remove all except unanswered messages from the system operator message queue (QSYSOPR) ?. Do not worry, because there is another way to accomplish the same task, and even it could be automated within a CL program or submitted as a batch job. The Remove Nonprogram Messages (QMHRMVM) API can do the trick for you. 






To do exactly the same thing you do with DSPMSG MSGQ(QSYSOPR) and pressing F16, follow these simple steps: 

1 Sign on the IBM OS/400, IBM i5/OS or IBM i. 
 *   * 2 From the IBM OS/400, IBM i5/OS or IBM i command line, type the following: 
      
      CALL PGM(QMHRMVM) PARM('QSYSOPR *LIBL ' ' ' '*KEEPUNANS' X'0000000000000000') 
      
      This ends the procedure to remove all except unanswered messages from the system operator message queue (QSYSOPR).
