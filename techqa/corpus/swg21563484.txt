QUESTION
 GIS DNS cache never updates an IP after a DNS name IP changes 

ANSWER


By Default Java uses an infinite time storage for the DNS cache. To change this you need to edit the <gis install directory>/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security file and update the following parameter after uncommenting it. GIS will need to be restarted for this setting to take effect.

networkaddress.cache.ttl=-1

#
# The Java-level namelookup cache policy for successful lookups:
#
# any negative value: caching forever
# any positive value: the number of seconds to cache an address for
# zero: do not cache
#
# default value is forever (FOREVER). For security reasons, this
# caching is made forever when a security manager is set.
#
# NOTE: setting this to anything other than the default value can have
# serious security implications. Do not set it unless 
# you are sure you are not exposed to DNS spoofing attack.
