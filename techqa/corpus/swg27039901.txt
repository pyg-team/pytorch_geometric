CONTENT
Description


IBM Atlas Policy Suite is part of IBM Information Lifecycle Governance solutions, which enable you to efficiently retain and archive information of value and effectively meet eDiscovery obligations across both structured and unstructured data. With other IBM Information Lifecycle Governance products, IBM Atlas Policy Suite enables the systematic and defensible disposal of unnecessary data, which reduces storage growth, reduces IT and legal costs, and lowers legal risk for organizations. 

For brief descriptions of new features, see the topic "What's new in IBM Atlas Policy Suite, V6.0.3?" in Planning, Installing, and Upgrading IBM Atlas Policy Suite(Planning_Installing_and_Upgrading_IBM_Atlas_Policy_Suite.pdf)

Compatibility issues with earlier versions 

You can upgrade directly to version 6.0.3 of IBM Atlas Policy Suite from any release of IBM Atlas Policy Suite Version 4.0 or later.

If you are using the IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication for IBM eDiscovery Manager connector from V6.0.2 or earlier and you want to upgrade to IBM Atlas Policy Suite V6.0.3, do not continue the upgrade. Instead, contact IBM Software Support. 

 

Installing IBM Atlas Policy Suite Version 6.0.3 

For information about installing version 6.0.3 of IBM Atlas Policy Suite, see the following guides in
the techdoc IBM Policy Atlas Suite V6.0.3 documentation library [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038846].

 * Planning, Installing, and Upgrading IBM Atlas Policy Suite 



32-bit runtime support on Red Hat Enterprise Linux V6 
By default, when you install the 64-bit version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux V6, only 64-bit runtime support is installed. However, some applications require 32-bit runtime support. 

If you did not choose to install 32-bit runtime support when you installed the 64-bit version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux V6, you must now install that support on any system that hosts one of the following applications:  * IBM Atlas Policy Suite 
 * IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication SDK 
 * IBM Retention Policy Syndication SDK


Use the appropriate rpm (Red Hat Package Manager) or yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) command to install the 32-bit version of the following packages. Operating systems that support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications require both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these packages. 

compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-69 
compat-db-4.6.21-15 
libstdc++-4.4.4-13 
libXp-1.0.0-15.1 
libXmu-1.0.5-1 
libXtst-1.0.99.2-3 
pam-1.1.1-4 
libXft-2.1.13-4.1 
gtk2-2.18.9-4 
gtk2-engines-2.18.4-5 

The IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication for InfoSphere Optim connector requires encrypted user names and passwords 
In IBM Atlas Policy Suite V6.0.3, the sourceOdmUsername, sourceOdmPassword, holdOdmUsername and holdOdmPassword values that are used in the OptimACASettings.xml file must be encrypted so that they can be used by the IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication for InfoSphere Optim connector. 
See the techdoc The IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication for InfoSphere Optim connector requires encrypted usernames and passwords [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040325].
