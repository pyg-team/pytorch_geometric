APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An online reorg utility failed in the log phase.  The index for
   the mapping table was user defined.  Prior to issuing the term
   utility command, the data sets for the mapping table index were
   deleted by a clean up process.  The subsequent term utility
   failed with RC00E40305.  Shadow data sets were deleted, but the
   utility was still in SYSUTILX.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 V8 and DB2 9 for z/OS utility        *
   *                 users of REORG SHRLEVEL CHANGE with          *
   *                 user-managed mapping table objects.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: TERM UTIL results in ABEND04E           *
   *                      RC00D70002 and console message          *
   *                      MSGDSNP017I identifying a missing       *
   *                      data set for the mapping index.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply corrective PTF when available.         *
   ****************************************************************
   An Online REORG, REORG SHRLEVEL CHANGE, was executed
   specifying a mapping table with user-managed objects.
   The REORG job failed during the LOG phase so that a
   DISPLAY UTIL command showed it was stopped.  At that
   point no TERM UTIL had been done, but the customer
   then deleted the user-managed data sets as part of
   their post utility cleanup processing.
   
   A subsequent TERM UTIL was then issued to clean up the
   stopped utility, but reset processing on the mapping
   index failed with message MSGDSNP017I and reason
   RC00D70002 because the mapping index data set was
   not found.
   
   At this point the utility could not be terminated. The
   TERM UTIL command could not complete because it always
   abended with the same error for the missing data set.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When issuing a TERM UTIL command, if the reset of the
   mapping index fails because the data set cannot be found,
   the error is tolerated, and TERM UTIL will complete without
   ABENDing.
