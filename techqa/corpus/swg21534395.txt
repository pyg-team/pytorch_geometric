QUESTION
 How do I configure pacing? (SCI50244) 

ANSWER


There are two places where pacing can be set; initparms, which determines the default values for all transfers, and netmap which defines the values on a per node basis.



_initparms_



pacing.send.delay 
Specifies the default time, in milliseconds, to wait between send operations if the value is not in the network map entry. The value entered in the Pacing Send Delay field of the TCP/IP Communication Mode object overrides this value. A value of zero indicates that a data buffer should be sent as soon as possible. A numeric value from 0?a??86,400,000 (one day in milliseconds). The default is 00.00.00.



_netmap_
Same as above, but relates specifically to one node:



Buffersize 
Specifies the buffer size for transmitting data to and from the remote Connect:Direct node. This value overrides the value in the initialization parameters file. A numeric value from 256 - 32,767. The default is 4096.



Pacing Send Count 
Specifies the number of send operations to perform before automatically waiting for a pacing response from the remote
Connect:Direct node. A value of 0 indicates that there is no pacing. This value overrides the value in the initialization parameters file. A numeric value from 0?a??63. The default is 0.



Pacing Send Delay 
Specifies the amount of time Connect:Direct waits before sending each outbound data buffer to the remote node. This can prevent flooding the network. A value of 0 indicates that Connect:Direct sends each data buffer as soon as possible. This value overrides the value in the initialization parameters file. An integer from 0-86400. The default is 0.
