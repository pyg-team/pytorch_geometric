APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When clicking on a first level folder of the Classification
   Library, there are two History buttons - one at the top of the
   page, one on the bottom.
   The top one creates a breadcrumb that redirects to
   templateFolderView.jsp. This is working as expected. The bottom
   one creates a breadcrumb that redirects to
   policyTemplateView.jsp.
   This is incorrect; it should also point to
   templateFolderView.jsp.
