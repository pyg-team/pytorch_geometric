ABSTRACT
 You would like to know if CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) V5.1, V4.3 and V4.2 fully support CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.2. You would also like to know if any additional PTFs are required. 

CONTENT
CICS VR V5.1, V4.3 and V4.2 fully support CICS TS V4.2. 

For CICS VR V5.1, refer to the CICS VR 5.1 Detailed System Requirements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=1266668088954&osPlatform=z/OS#] 'Prerequisites' tab.

If you plan on deploying the CICS VR support for automated recovery [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwig/whatisthecicsvrautomatedrecoveryforcicsts.html] within CICS TS V4.2, you will need to apply the PTF for CICS VR APAR PM34799 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM34799] to add this support to CICS VR V4.2 and V4.3.

If you do not plan on deploying CICS VR support for automated recovery or forward recovering extended ESDS [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.applicationprogramming.doc/topics/dfhp3_esds_upgrade.html] files within CICS TS V4.2, you can continue to use CICS VR V4.1 (although it is no longer in service).

As of 31 July 2013, CICS VR V5.1, V4.3, and V4.2 are the supported versions of CICS VR. Refer to the CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS website [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/vr/] and the Announcement letters for CICS products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21227090] for information on the latest releases of CICS VR.

Both CICS VR V3.2 and V3.3 are no longer supported, nor is CICS VR V4.1. Refer to the Support Lifecycle page [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/index_c.html] for more details.
