LOCAL FIX
 *  Rename problem ver files andrun uninstall again.
   
   Perform following steps to prevent this problem:
   
   1) Stop all ITM components incl failing agent - here e.g. the OQ
   (Microsoft SQL Server) agent - using the Manage Tivoli
   Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) utility
   
   2) Go to the folder %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\ver\ where the
   appropriate .ver files exist ( e.g. here for the failing agent
   KOQ*.ver like KOQWICNS.ver, KOQWIXEB.ver, KOQWIXEW.ver,
   KOQWIIEH.ver, KOQWICMS.ver)
   
   3) Rename just these KOQ* files to e.g. bkkup_KOQ*
   
   4) Re-launch the un-installation process as before:
   
   Start -> Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs
   5) Restore the KOQ* files in  %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\ver\
   renamed in step 3 to original names.
