APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While you try to install an advanced process application on a
   process server, you might see the following error:
   
   CWWBF0152E: The contribution '<advanced project name>' cannot be
   found in snapshot '<snapshot id>'.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Before deploying different snapshots, restart the deployment
   manager when switching deployment between process servers or the
    Process Center server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Deployment can fail when a process server is on the same cell as
    an IBM Process Center or other process servers and an advanced
   process application is deployed to the Process Center server or
   installed on the process server. This failure occurs because the
    server information is cached by the deployment manager during
   the first advanced deployment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that prevents the server information from being cached during
   deployment when there are multiple deployment environments
   detected on the same cell.
