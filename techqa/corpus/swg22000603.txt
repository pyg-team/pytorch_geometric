What is Bulk/Mass Candidate Upload? 
Mass/Bulk candidate upload came out in Release 13.1 and allows users with the appropriate privilege to import up to 100 candidates at a time into BrassRing via an excel spreadsheet. Users can include the candidates’ education/experience history, req info, and candidate form data. This functionality provides a way for clients to get candidate data into the system without having to create candidates one at a time or requiring the candidates to apply via the Talent Gateway. Clients may collect the candidates’ information while at a job fair or career expo and import them into BrassRing at a later time. 

How do I enable/configure Bulk/Mass Candidate Upload for my users? 
To enable this feature, provide the respective user type with the "Candidate Actions 2" privilege: 
Candidates – bulk upload. 

Tools > Users > User Types > select Edit Type Permissions for the user type you would like to enable this functionality for > Candidate Actions 2.

Candidates that are submitted through the bulk/mass upload feature will be checked/stacked based on the stacking logic configured in Client Settings. Client settings can only be configured by Kenexa representatives so if you would like your stacking logic changed, please reach out to your contact. For reference, the client setting is called Bulk Upload, and the stacking logic options mimic the options available for the Talent Gateways. 

How do I prepare my Excel file for upload? 
Review the Instructions Excel document on the Add Multiple Candidates page ( Hiring > Candidates > Add Candidate > Add Multiple Candidates). After you review the Instructions, launch the sample file for a 'template' from which you can base your import file off of. (You can skip this step if you have already prepared an appropriate structured .xls file for upload.) 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&aid=2] 

Instructions and Requirements for the file:  * Must be a .xls or .xlsx file type for upload. 
 * Candidates should only be listed in the FIRST sheet of the excel spreadsheet. 
 * Max upload: 100 candidates 
 * If uploading data for a Date field type, make sure the cells are formatted as text before entering the date. 
 * Only ACTIVE candidate form fields can be used as column headers. 
 * The following columns must be filled out: First Name, Last Name, Email, Home Phone, Language. Clients will also want to include any fields that are used in their Stacking Logic to ensure that the candidates are stacked appropriately. 
 * ALL required fields on a candidate form must be present on the spreadsheet (column header and field value) in order to upload successfully. 
 * Req ID is a mandatory field if at least one per-req candidate form is in the upload file. 
 * For User list fields on a form, include the User’s name in the exact format of how it appears in the candidate form UI.

Instruction Example Date fields should be entered in following format: DD/MM/YYYY or DD-MM-YYYY 22/12/2016 or 22-12-2016 Use ## as the delimiter for multiple values in multi-select fields. Lincoln##Madison Include the Req ID value as displayed in BrassRing, including the BR if shown. 12BR Use code OR description for candidate form field options. Y or Yes Column names for candidate form fields should be in the format: <candidate form field – database name> [EmploymentApplication]PreviousEmployer
[OfferForm]Salary 

How do I import the Excel file?

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&aid=5] 
(4) The system completes a mapping verification which verifies that all the column headers in the file are appropriate and that candidate records have not exceeded 100, and displays a confirmation message. If there are no errors, a successful message will be displayed and the user can click Next. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&amp;aid=6] 
 * If the file fails mapping verification, the system displays an error message. To resolve this error review your spreadsheet columns.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000603&amp;aid=8] 

(6) The file is then submitted for processing and a message is displayed to the user notifying them that an email will be sent once the file has completed processing.

What are some of the potential error messages and how do I resolve them? 
Error: '"Gradyear2" is not in a valid format: Valid characters are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,”,”-“,”.”,”,”,”(“,”)”, “ “, “A-Z”, “a-z" 
Resolution: Make sure the file has a valid year format for the Gradyear column. A valid year example is 2002. 

Error: "GPA2" is not in a valid format. Valid format is ###.## 
Resolution: Make sure the file has a valid GPA format for the GPA column. A valid GPA example is 3.76. 

Error: '"State" is not a valid value 
Resolution: Make sure the file has a valid State format for the State column. A valid state example is NE. 

Error: "Country" is not in a valid format: Valid countries are 2 or 3 characters (standard ISO codes) 
Resolution: Make sure the file has a valid Country format for the Country column. A valid country example is US. 

Error: "Country" field exceeds max length:<max length> 
Resolution: Make sure the file has a valid Country format for the Country column. A valid country example is US. 

Error: '<skip>The candidate record was not created or updated. Invalid HR status order specified. Statuses must be imported in an order consistent with the configured tracking logic steps. 
Resolution: Make sure that the HR Statuses listed in the HR Status column are valid statuses according to the tracking logic within your system. If the candidates being uploaded are new, check the Start status that candidates are filed into the req form with. If any status is used for auto-filing into the req, that status should be used and other start statuses will not be able to be included in the upload. 

Error: <skip>The candidate record was not created or updated. A valid job req code is required while importing or updating HR Status. 
Resolution: If you would like to file a candidate into a req via the upload, the Req Code (AutoReq ID) must be include in both the ReqID and Codes columns. Also ensure Requisition ID is suffixed with BR.
