APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On the JSESSIONID a delimiter is used to parse the session ID
   from the Application Server ID.  This delimiter is set and
   returned from the Application Server to the ODR for session
   routing.
   
   By default this is set to colon (:) in the application server.
   However, the Application Server session management or
   webcontainer (deprecated in 7.0) properties CloneSeparatorChange
   and CloneSeparator can be used to change the delimiter to
   another character.  Most commonly if changed this will be set to
   plus sign (+) however, this does not have to be the case.
   
   Since the delimiter is returned from the application server and
   the ODR can route to multiple application servers there is no
   guarantee that each application server will use the same
   delimiter.  However, currently the ODR can only read a single
   delimiter.  This means that the ODR could fail to route to
   application servers which are not using the same delimiter that
   the ODR is using.  This can be seen in the ODR trace as the
   example below:
   
   [1/5/12 12:17:19:928 EST] 0000001c XDDWLMClientS 3   delimiter
   ':' not
   found in session ID '1111j4KdU1111DCtec_MuEiujK_+16mkl87y6'
   
   This shows a response from an application server which is using
   a separator of '+' however, the ODR is looking for a delimiter
   of ':'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set all the CloneSeparators in the application servers to the
   same value and use this value in the ODR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere Virtual Enterprise   *
   *                  that                                        *
   *                  have configured a web container to use non- *
   *                  default clone id separators.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The On Demand Router does not properly  *
   *                      handle non-default clone id             *
   *                      separators.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The On Demand Router does not properly handle clone id
   separators
   when web container custom property CloneSeparatorChange has been
   set to true.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Support for the CloneSeparatorChange web customer property has
   been added to the On Demand Configuration component. Please note
   that PM55852 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM55852] is also needed before the On Demand Router will
   properly handle the CloneSeparatorChange web customer property.
