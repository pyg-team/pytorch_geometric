APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Rational Developer for System z - RDz / IDz
   
   Attempts to use Push to client to install a client update
   may cause the client to hang.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Check the <workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\
   com.ibm.ftt.resources.zos.folder to see what has been
   downloaded from the host for installation.
   
   The client may already have the necessary files downloaded.
   The following files will be in com.ibm.ftt.resources.zos :
   runinstallation.bat
   runrestart.bat
   
   If so, you can manually shutdown the RDz/IDz client.
   Then, start the installation by executing the
   runinstallation.bat file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The workbench may hang when push-to-client is attempting to
   update a product version because the update needs to disconnect
   from the host before shutting down the workbench at the same
   time that the initial connect which triggered the update is
   trying to complete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The solution is to move the disconnect and shutdown off the main
    thread.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
   IBM Rational Developer for z Systems V9.5.1.6 Fix Pack which
   is available from the Recommended Fixes support download page:
