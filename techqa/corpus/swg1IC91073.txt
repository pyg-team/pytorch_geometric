APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a lan-free environment, the following can occur, when
   VM control file data located in a primary storage pool
   that does not have a lan-free path is required ;
   
   1.   A client asks for a file to be restored.  Since this goes
   through the storage agent, the first request will ignore disk
   storage pool volumes.
   2.   If the file is available through a lan-free path we will
   restore it from there, that is why a copy pool volume mount can
   occur if there is no lanfree path to a primary storage pool is
   available.
   3.   If the file is not available through a lan-free path but
   available on a LAN accessible storage pool then
   the data  will be proxied over the lan from the server through
   the storage agent to the client.
   
   
   So, if VM backup data is organized the following way :
   
   1. disk primary pool for CTL data
   2. sequential lan-free accessible primary storage pool for the
   VM data
   3. lan-free accessible copy pool for the data of both previous
   pools
   
   In case a backup VM or restore VM process needs CTL data and all
   primary pools data has a copy in the copypool, then we will
   mount a copypool volume to get that CTL data since the primary
   diskpool is not lan-free accessible.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CTL files are now restored over LAN even if lanfree is used.
