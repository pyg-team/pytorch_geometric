Title: IBM Prevent SEA Broadcast or Network Storms - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I prevent SEA broadcast or network storms? 

CAUSE
Proper sequence of steps to configure SEA failover has not been followed and the result is a broadcast or network storm. 

ANSWER
Refer to "How to Setup SEA Failover on DUAL VIO Servers" document for proper sequence of steps to create SEA failover. 

The Shared Ethernet Adapter is designed to prevent network loops. However, as an additional precaution, you can enable Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard on the switch ports connected to the physical adapters of the Shared Ethernet Adapter. BPDU Guard detects looped Spanning Tree Protocol BPDU packets and shuts down the port. This helps prevent broadcast storms on the network. 

Note: When the Shared Ethernet Adapter is using GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP), it generates BPDU packets, which causes BPDU Guard to shut down the port unnecessarily. Therefore, when the Shared Ethernet Adapter is using GVRP, do not enable BPDU Guard. 

For information about how to enable the Spanning Tree Protocol, the portfast option, and BPDU Guard on the ports, see the documentation provided with the switch.
