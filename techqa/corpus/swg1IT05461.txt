APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The schema file 'Z_Segments.xsd' is shipped as an empty schema
   with no global declarations. This file imports definitions
   from another schema.
   If you add a type or element to 'Z_Segments.xsd' that
   requires DFDL annotations, then errors will appear in the
   'Problems' view, such as:
   
   CTDX1103E Type reference ... is unresolved
   CTDX1103E The element is not permitted as contrained by ...
   
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): HL7, DFDL Schema
   Z_Segments.xsd
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually edit the schema files and ensure that any
   xsd:annotations are declared after any xsd:imports.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack needing to add
   their own Z-segments into the schema 'Z_segments.xsd.
   
   
   Platforms affected:

   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If you try to create a new global element in Z_segments.xsd
   using the DFDL editor, a Null Pointer Exception is reported and
   errors appear in the Problems view claiming that the xsd is not
   valid.

   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now ensures that xs:include statements are
   positioned before xs:import statements in all DFDL xsd files.
