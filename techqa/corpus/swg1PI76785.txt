APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The time stamp in the output listing from the REXX compiler does
   not take into account leap seconds, so it is currently 27
   seconds out with other z/OS time stamps.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of REXX Compiler on z/OS               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Time stamp on REXX compiler listing     *
   *                      was incorrect by leap second amount.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The time stamp in the REXX compiler listing was out by about
   27 seconds because it used its own old implementation of the
   C time() function which was written before MVS provided the
   leap second offset.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The internal version of the time() function used by the REXX
   compiler has been modified to adjust the time to take account
   of the leap second offset if available, so the time stamp on
   the listing is now correct.
