All fix pack levels of IBM DB2 V9.7, V10.1 and V10.5 editions listed below and running on AIX, Linux, HP, Solaris or Windows are affected. 

IBM® DB2® Express Edition
IBM® DB2® Workgroup Server Edition
IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition
IBM® DB2® Advanced Enterprise Server Edition
IBM® DB2® Advanced Workgroup Server Edition
IBM® DB2® Connect™ Application Server Edition 
IBM® DB2® Connect™ Enterprise Edition
IBM® DB2® Connect™ Unlimited Edition for System i® 
IBM® DB2® Connect™ Unlimited Edition for System z®

IBM® DB2® pureScale™ Feature for Enterprise Server Edition, V9.8, running on AIX or Linux is affected.

The IBM data server client and driver types are as follows: 

IBM Data Server Driver Package
IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI 
IBM Data Server Runtime Client
IBM Data Server Client 

For DB2 Advanced Copy Services
IBM DB2 Advanced Copy Services included in IBM DB2 and DB2 Connect V10.1 and V10.5 editions listed below and running on AIX and Linux are affected. 

IBM DB2 Express Edition
IBM DB2 Workgroup Server Edition
IBM DB2 Enterprise Server Edition
IBM DB2 Connect™ Application Server Edition 
IBM DB2 Connect Application Server Advanced Edition 
IBM DB2 Connect Enterprise Edition
IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Edition for System i® 
IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Edition for System z®
IBM DB2 Connect Unlimited Advanced Edition for System z
IBM DB2 10.1 pureScale Feature
IBM DB2 10.5 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition
IBM DB2 10.5 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition
IBM DB2 10.5 Developer Edition for Linux, Unix and Windows

NOTE: The DB2 Connect products mentioned are affected only if a local database has been created. 

Only users of DB2 Advanced Copy Services (snapshot backup) are affected by this vulnerability. IBM DB2 includes restricted version of IBM Tivoli Flash Copy Manager, i.e. FCM v3.2 and v4.1, and both versions are affected by this vulnerability. IBM DB2 Advanced Copy Services in conjunction with IBM Tivoli FCM 3.2 or 4.1, on all current fix packs of IBM DB2 V10.1 and V10.5, are affected. AIX installations of DB2 may have this package installed by default, though it may not be in use on the system.

 * 
 * Fix for customer running IBM data server client and driver types
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Upgrading of global GSKit is required if either of the following applies to you:
 *   * IBM data server client and driver types V9.7, V10.1 level and any V10.5 level before fixpack 5. 
    * IBM data server client and driver types V10.5 fixpack 5 and the additionally installed global GSKit version is 8.0.50.46 or less.
   
   
 * 
 * Where to obtain the global GSKit depends on the DB2 release and platform:
 * 
 *  IBM data server client and driver types V10.5 fix pack 5 and additionally installed global GSKit version is 8.0.50.46 or less, download "IBM DB2 Support Files for SSL Functionality" from IBM Passport Advantage and perform the GSKit upgrade. IBM data server client and driver types V9.7, V10.1 level and any V10.5 level before fixpack 5:  * Client and the server are on the same physical computer: For the Windows platform, you do not need to upgrade the GSKit as GSKit is automatically installed with the DB2 server image. For all other platforms, you will need to download "IBM DB2 Support Files for SSL Functionality" from IBM Passport Advantage. 
    * Client and the server are on different computer: For all platforms, download "IBM DB2 Support Files for SSL Functionality" from IBM Passport Advantage and perform the GSKit upgrade.
