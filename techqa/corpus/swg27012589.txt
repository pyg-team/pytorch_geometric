ABSTRACT
 This WebSphere Support Technical Exchange is designed to show you how Debugging has become a lost art. This is the session for you if you want to build your CICS debugging skills. This session concentrates where CICS Level 2 has seen the most problems in File Control. You should learn how to debug FCIOWAITs, Private String waits, and Enqueues. This presentation was created at the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) 3.2 level, but most of the information still applies; however things like offsets might have changed.
