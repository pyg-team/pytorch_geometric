APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a scenario where a page that has defined titles for many
   locales is allowed to share its content and another page derives
   from it, but does not explicitly specify own titles for the
   originally defined locales, incorrectly localized titles are
   displayed. Users, that have configured their browsers to a
   different language than the default locale of WebSphere Portal,
   will be displayed the page title of the explicitly derived pages
   in the default locale of WebSphere Portal - not in the locale
   actually configured in the browser.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In a scenario where a page that has defined titles for many
   locales is allowed to share its content and another page derives
   from it, but does not explicitly specify own titles for the
   originally defined locales, incorrectly localized titles are
   displayed. Users, that have configured their browsers to a
   different language than the default locale of WebSphere Portal,
   will be displayed the page title of the explicitly derived pages
   in the default locale of WebSphere Portal - not in the locale
   actually configured in the browser.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to consider localized data defined in
   higher inheritance layers.
