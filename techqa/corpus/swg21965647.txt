Title: IBM Updating an AEL from a map within a Web Widget - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A monitor box in a map within a Web Widget is configured to update an AEL using wires, but nothing happens to the AEL when the object is clicked. How can I get this working? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is not possible to directly update the AEL using Update Event List using Wires when the map is being called from a Web Widget. This can, however, be worked around by placing the AEL within a Web Widget as well. Once the AEL is within a Web Widget and a name is assigned to the Web Widget (e.g. 'ael1'), an Open URL action can be configured for the monitor box. 

- Configuration of the monitor box:
Action = Open URL
* URL = $(SERVER)/AELView?filtertype=global&filtername=<filter>&viewname=Default &viewtype=global&datasource=NCOMS
* Target = ael1
- Configuration of AEL inside Web Widget:
* Home Page =
https://<host>:<port>/ibm/console/webtop/AELView?filtertype=global&filtername=<filter>&viewname=Default&viewtype=global&datasource=NCOMS
* Iframe name = ael1 


One proviso of this solution is that the AEL's own widget preferences cannot be set graphically and must be passed via the URL, as per the examples in the Related Information link below.
