APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The XC10 will queue authenication requests if it cannot reach
   the LDAP.  Once the LDAP becomes available the XC10 can send a
   large burst of requests which leads to the XC10 being
   blacklisted from the LDAP server.
   
   This causes LDAP authenication failures such as:
   
    LdapGroupCach E
   com.ibm.websphere.users.LdapGroupCache queryLDAP Unable to get
   user DN for user  <user_name>
   
   RainmakerLdap W
   com.ibm.websphere.rainmaker.users.RainmakerLdapContext getUserDn
   Error getting user DN from LDAP
   
   javax.naming.CommunicationException:
   <LDAP_hostname>:389 [Root exception is
   java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer]
    at com.sun.jndi.ldap.Connection.<init>(Connection.java:239)
    at com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient.<init>(LdapClient.java:149)

   com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient.getInstance(LdapClient.java:1621)
    at com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx.connect(LdapCtx.java:2711)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Have the XC10 on the LDAP's whitelist so it cannot be blocked
   even when sending a large number of requests
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All XC10 users utilizing LDAP               *
   *                  authentication.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Network problems between the XC10 and   *
   *                      the LDAP server can lead to a burst of  *
   *                      authentication requests to the LDAP     *
   *                      server once the network issues are      *
   *                      resolved.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The LDAP authentication mechanism allowed duplicate
   requests to queue up during network outages. As soon as the
   network outage was resolved, the queue would drain. Since
   there was no protection against duplicate authentication
   requests, a large burst of requests could all be sent at the
   same time, which resulted in potential blacklisting of the
   XC10 appliance by the LDAP server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was updated to eliminate duplicate requests from
   being queued.
