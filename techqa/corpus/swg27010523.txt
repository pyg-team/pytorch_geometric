CONTENT
The #1Configuration Manager, User Name Server #2and Broker#c requirements for the following products or equivalents are supported at the specified minimum levels. 

 
Configuration Manager, User Name Server and Broker Requirements:



Please read first [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * WebSphere Message Broker, WebSphere MQ Integrator, and Integrator Broker product READMEs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] 
 * Before installing any new products, ensure that you review their current Preventative Service Planning (PSP) information. 
 * Where patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. 
 * Message Broker supports any JMS 1.1 provider, and requires a minimum JRE level of Java 1.5. Both of these factors need to be considered when selecting a JMS provider whose client will be embedded in Message Broker. 
 *  [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2239&uid=swg24014302]Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere Message Broker has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere Message Broker Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself. 

Hardware Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * Any server capable of running one of the listed IBM z/OS releases 

Operating Systems [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * IBM z/OS V1R7 (5694-A01), at RSU0609 or later, plus PTFs for APARs PK34716 and PK34041. 
 * IBM SMP/E for z/OS (5655-G44) V3R3 or later

XML Toolkit [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * XML Toolkit (5655-J51) V1.9 for z/OS

Javaâ„¢ [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * 31-bit SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, V5 (SR5 or later service release) 

Databases
(required for the broker component only) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1] Brokers can access Information Integrator data sources, for user data, on WebSphere Information Integrator Classic Federation for z/OS V8.2, providing connectivity with z/OS data sources: IMS, VSAM, ISAM, sequential files, CA-IDMS, CA-Datacom, Software AG ADABAS, and DB2. Brokers can connect directly to WebSphere Information Integrator Classic Federation for z/OS V8.2 by JDBC only. 

Brokers can connect indirectly to WebSphere Information Integrator Classic Federation for z/OS V8.2 though an intermediate DB2 system on z/OS. When using this configuration, only an ODBC CAF connection is supported between the broker and DB2, and therefore this support does not include two-phase-commit. 

Please note that all broker ODBC data sources will be either CAF or RRSAF. When CAF is used, database operations are not coordinated by RRS. This includes any updates to the broker database as well as user databases. 


 * IBM DB2 Universal Database (5625-DB2) V8.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/zos/family/], at RSU0609 or later, plus FMID JDB8817 (ODBC support), plus PTFs for APAR PK37248 [see section note 1 
 * IBM DB2 V9.1 [http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/zos/family/] or later, plus FMID JDB9917 (ODBC support), plus PTFs for APAR PK41943 [see section note 1] 
 * or later version of IBM DB2 Universal Database [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/zos/family/]


Notes:  1. Automatic Client Reroute for DB2 is supported.

WebSphere MQ [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010523&amp;aid=1]  * IBM WebSphere MQ (5655-L82) for z/OS, V6.0, at RSU0609 or later, plus FMID JMS6008 (MQ connectivity), plus PTFs for APARs PK53810 and PK55665 [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/] 
 * IBM WebSphere MQ (5655-R36) for z/OS, V7.0 or later, plus FMID JMS7008 (MQ connectivity), plus PTFs for APARs PK69317, PK70759 and PK73269 [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/] [see section note 1]
