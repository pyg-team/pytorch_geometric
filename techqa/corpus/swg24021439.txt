Text:
SIB SIBus SIBDestHandler DOWNLOADABLE FILES

ABSTRACT
 A tool to view, move, copy, delete, save and restore messages in the default messaging provider for IBM WebSphere Application Server version 6.0 and later. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The IBM Service Integration Bus Destination Handler tool provides a flexible interface to perform a range of different actions on messages, which would otherwise require custom coding, or a number of separate and time consuming manual steps. 

Actions can be run once to perform an individual task, or the tool can be deployed as a WebSphere Application Server scheduler task to regularly check the contents of an exception destination and provide appropriate handling of messages based on the set of rules configured.

A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to perform actions interactively and create configuration files. The GUI also provides facilities to send test messages to queues or topics. Screenshot below.

The actions which can be performed upon a message by the tool include:
- Printing out the properties and body of messages in a readable form
- Moving messages to a different queue point
- Copying messages to a another destination
- Deleting messages from a queue point or subscription
- Resubmitting messages from an exception destination back to the exception problem destination
- Saving binary copies of messages to files
- Restoring messages from files to destinations
- Sending e-mails to administrators containing details of messages

The actions can be performed on all messages on a particular destination, or on a subset of those messages. Messages can be selected based on JMS headers. Messages containing text can be selected based on their contents, including XPath selection for messages containing XML formatted data.

Possible uses
- Gathering a snapshot of the contents of a queue to send to an application developer, or IBM customer support for investigation
- Searching the contents of a queue for an individual message or group of messages
- Examining the contents of a message which cannot be processed by an application
- Handling a case where a message has been sent to the wrong queue point
- Moving messages from a queue point where no application is available to consume them
- Moving messages to a different bus
- Moving messages that can never be processed from an exception destination to a permanent failure destination
- Resubmitting messages from an exception destination after restarting a database or other system required to process them
- Copying messages from a production bus to a test bus for investigation
- Creating a copy of a set of JMS messages sent by an application to use multiple times in testing
- Loading a set of JMS messages from disk onto a destination as the input for a test
- Configuring an exception destination handler to inform an administrator when certain conditions occur
