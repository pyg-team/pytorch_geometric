PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM MQ is not performing as quickly as you wish, and you need assistance from IBM to find a solution. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions apply to IBM MQ on Linux, UNIX, Windows, IBM i, HP NonStop Server and HP OpenVMS systems. Refer to the IBM MQ Read First page for instructions on other operating systems:

Performance problems handled by IBM services vs. IBM support


The performance of your system depends on many factors, including appropriate sizing of hardware to meet your business requirements, systems and software configuration, network configuration, and application design. Your IBM Representative can arrange an IBM services engagement if you need assistance planning, deploying, upgrading or tuning systems to meet your performance objectives.


However, if you find that your IBM MQ messaging performance is well out of line with published reports, or if you see that performance has dropped while going to a new version or maintenance level, you should contact IBM support. Once the problem has been resolved in MQ or its cause identified outside IBM hardware or software, IBM support is not responsible for further systems analysis or tuning.






RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM publishes performance reports which evaluate the performance qualities of MQ under a number of scenarios. Some of the performance reports focus on specific functional areas, such as publish/subscribe performance, Java Message Service (JMS) performance, and the IBM Message Service interface (XMS) interface.

If you believe there is a defect or regression which is preventing MQ from performing in line with its reports, collect the same information you would for a hang or high CPU usage problem. If you have both a working system and a slow system, collect data from both for comparison. In addition, please ensure your system is up-to-date on operating system patches and firmware:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS
Please provide as much detail as you can about the hardware and software on the systems:



 1.  A description of the system, its CPUs and available memory
 2.  
 3.  Disk information for the MQ filesystems (e.g. SCSI, NAS, SAN, etc.)
 4.  
 5.  Other software running on the system (e.g. databases, application servers, etc.)
 6.  
 7.  Other traffic on your network or SAN which could affect MQ
 8.  
 9.  Firewalls and other network devices which could affect MQ
 10. 
 11. The specific channels, queues, topics, and applications involved
 12. 
 13. Details on how you are measuring MQ performance
 14. 
 15. The full set of performance numbers you recorded




PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS INVOLVING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS
If your performance problem involves queue managers, clusters, and applications across multiple systems, you must provide sufficient detail to IBM support about each system. For example, if you were seeing excessively slow round-trip messaging performance involve request and reply messages flowing through an MQ network, you would need to provide:



 1.  Information about all systems involved, including the CPU, memory, network, disk, operating system and MQ versions on each.
 2.  
 3.  The names and configuration of all topics, queues, channels, queue managers and clusters used to send requests and replies through the full round-trip.
 4.  
 5.  Details of the back-end application and its rate of processing, as well as any queue depths or channel statistics indicating the location of the bottleneck.
 6.  
 7.  Observations on network performance, including packet traces on both ends of a connection if you suspect excessively slow transfer rates.
 8.  
 9.  Information on any changes to MQ, the systems, the network, or the applications made before the problem started.
 10. 
 11. A list of any errors or unusual conditions you saw which may be relevant to the problem.
 12. 



Please refer to the IBM Software Support Handbook [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/handbook/home.html] for more information on working with IBM support and on the types of problems which are handled by IBM support and by IBM services engagements.
