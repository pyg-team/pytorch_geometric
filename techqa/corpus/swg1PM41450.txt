APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Transition from join to terminatin connector results in one of
   the concurrent state's 'Action on Exit' not being called

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In cases where orthogonal states exit to a join connector
   that is followed by a termination connector, the code that
   is generated always uses the exit action of the first state
   regardless of which of the orthogonal states the system was
   in.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in version 8.0. To preserve the previous code
   generation behavior for pre-8.0 models, a property called
   CG::Statechart::UsePre80StatechartCG was added to the
   backward compatibility settings for C, C++, and Java with a
   value of True.
   
   In the original description of the item, the user also
   indicated that there is an additional defect: the exit
   action of the AND state containing all orthogonal components
   is not executed. Since the target of the compound
   transitions is a termination connector (terminate pseudo
   state), this is not a defect according to the UML
   specification. Following is a citation: "Entering a
   terminate pseudostate implies that the execution of this
   state machine by means of its context object is terminated.
   The state machine does not exit any states nor does it
   perform any exit actions other than those associated with
   the transition leading to the terminate pseudostate."
