APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After applying ptf UK38234 for PK68884 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK68884], the IBM VS COBOL II
   Release 4.0 compiler will issue error message MSGIGYDS0008
   for lines generated by the DB2 precompiler in V8 New Function
   Mode or V9 when the QUOTE precompiler option and the QUOTE
   compiler option are specified.
   The line generated by the precompiler that the compiler error
   is issued for is:
              05 FILLER          PIC X(20) VALUE
                 X'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'.
   The error is not issued by COBOL compilers that are supported
   for use with the DB2 for z/OS precompiler.
   It is recommended that supported COBOL compilers (as specified
   in the DB2 for z/OS Program Directory) be used with the DB2
   precompiler.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It is recommended that supported COBOL compilers (as specified
   in the DB2 for z/OS Program Directory) be used with the DB2
   precompiler.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the DB2 for z/OS precompiler with   *
   *                 the QUOTE precompiler option for COBOL host  *
   *                 applications, and compiling with             *
   *                 non-supported COBOL compilers, such as       *
   *                 IBM VS COBOL II Release 4.0.                 *

   After applying ptf UK38234 for PK68884 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK68884], the IBM VS COBOL II
   Release 4.0 compiler will issue error message MSGIGYDS0008
   for lines generated by the DB2 precompiler in V8 New Function
   Mode or V9 when the QUOTE precompiler option and the QUOTE
   compiler option are specified.
   
   The line generated by the precompiler that the compiler error
   is issued for is:
   
              05 FILLER          PIC X(20) VALUE
                 X'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'.
   
   The error issued by the IBM VS COBOL II compiler is:
   IGYDS0008-E   A quote or an apostrophe was used as a character
     string delimiter.  It was not the delimiter option in effect.
   
   The error is not issued by COBOL compilers that are supported
   for use with the DB2 for z/OS precompiler version 810 or 910.
   
   It is recommended that supported COBOL compilers (as specified
   in the DB2 for z/OS Program Directory) be used with the DB2
   precompiler.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DB2 for z/OS precompiler is modified so that the delimiter
   for string values in lines generated by the precompiler is
   consistent with the QUOTE precompiler option.
