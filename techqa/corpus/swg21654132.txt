Title: IBM Reordering Properties in a Document Class - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I reorder properties on a document class? 

CAUSE
If you have a requirement where you must modify the order in which properties from a document class are accessed in an indexing mask or other programmatic function, you can use FileNet Enterprise Manager or ACCE to reorder them.

ANSWER
Limitations: You may use this procedure to reorder properties, given that the properties were created in Content Engine 4.5 or higher, and for which you are not attempting to change the storage type. 

First, FileNet Enterprise Manager sorts the properties in the properties pane alphabetically, even though their 'ordinal' order is how they display in the Property Definitions tab. So make sure you're using a consistent display that displays the actual order (by ordinal) and not sorted alphabetically.

In the Property Definitions tab, if the list appears as:
propD
propC
propA

And your goal is have both displays sorted alphabetically - meaning that you must re-order the properties in the PropertyDefinitions tab (which is by ordinal), then:

Select propD and click Remove
Then BEFORE clicking Apply, repeat with propC.
Then BEFORE clicking Apply, click the Add/Remove button and select propC and propD.
Then click OK, then Apply or OK on the parent dialog, and you should see that the properties on both the properties pane, and in the Property Definitions tab, are in the same order:
propA
propC
propD
