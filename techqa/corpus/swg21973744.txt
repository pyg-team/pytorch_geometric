QUESTION
 How can I limit the Users and User Groups pulled from LDAP repository in IBM Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH)/JazzSM? 

ANSWER
You can define User and User Group filter in WebSphere Administrative console to limit the users and groups being pulled in DASH. 

Before making any changes make a backup copy of below file. In case you have any issue replace this file with the original file and restart DASH. This will revert any changes made to LDAP configuration.

<JazzSM_HOME>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/wim/config/wimconfig.xml

A. User Filter:
Suppose you want to pull the users from LDAP which belong to below groups.
CN=TIPL2 Group,CN=Users,DC=sflab,DC=local
CN=testgroup,CN=Users,DC=sflab,DC=local

Above can be achieved by defining search filter as below:
1. Login to WebSphere Administrative Console.
2. Click on Security--> Global Security 
3. Click on Configure under "Available realm definitions"
4. Click on Repository Identifier for the LDAP repository
5. Click on " Federated repositories entity types to LDAP object classes mapping " link at the bottom. 
6. Click on "PersonAccount"
7. Under Search filter add below filter: 
(&(objectclass=user) (|(memberOf=CN=TIPL2 Group,CN=Users,DC=sflab,DC=local)
(memberOf=CN=testgroup,CN=Users,DC=sflab,DC=local)))

In addition you can specify "Search bases" if needed otherwise "Base Entry" defined for this repository will be used.

B. Group Filter:
Suppose you want to limit the User Groups from LDAP which meet certain criteria. For instance you want to pull user groups which match group name TIPL2* and testgroup.
To achieve this you can define below Group filter.
1. Login to WebSphere Administrative Console.
2. Click on Security--> Global Security 
3. Click on Configure under "Available realm definitions"
4. Click on Repository Identifier for the LDAP repository
5. Click on " Federated repositories entity types to LDAP object classes mapping" link at the bottom.
6. Click on "Group"
7. Under Search filter add below filter: 

(&(ObjectCategory=Group)(|(CN=TIPL2*) (CN=testgroup)))

In addition you can specify "Search bases" if needed otherwise "Base Entry" defined for this repository will be used.

After above changes re-start DASH.
