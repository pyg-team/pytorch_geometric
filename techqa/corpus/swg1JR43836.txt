ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you search tasks in IBM Process Portal by using the Search
   field in Work > My Tasks, the search might not display the
   correct set of tasks and an error similar to the following error
   might be displayed:
   
   RestHelper    W   CWTBG0565E: An error occurred while running
   the requested search. Try running your search again. If this
   problem persists, contact your system administrator and refer
   them to this error's code in the error log.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The file handles that are used during task searches to access
   the task index on the IBM BPM server file system are not always
   closed, resulting in a file handle leak.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.0.0.0 is available that ensures file
   handles are closed as task search operations are completed,
   eliminating the file handle leak.
