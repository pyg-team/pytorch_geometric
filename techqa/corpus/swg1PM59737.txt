APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to create a dynamic web project (following the 2.4 or
   2.5 specification) with the IBM JAX-RS Configuration (or the
   JAX-RS 1.1 facet) specified and targeting a WebSphere
   Application Server v6.1 or v7.0 runtime may result in an error
   dialog showing a NullPointerException and the JAX-RS classpath
   library missing from the build path of the project.
   
   Problem:
   
   If you have a WebSphere Portal Server v6.1 (using either
   WebSphere Application Server v6.1 or v7.0) or WebSphere Portal
   Server v7.0 defined in workspace as a Server Runtime
   Environments then a NullPointerException similar to the
   following will be produced in this situation:
   
   ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core 4 0 2011-08-08

   ...
   
   Local fix:
   
   Define your own User Library for the Java Build Path of your
   project. For example, if targeting WebSphere Application Server
   v6.1 then create a User Library with required jars from this
   runtime location (?RAD 8.0 Install
   Dir?\SDP\runtimes\base_v61\web2mobilefep_1.1\optionalLibraries\)
   and add them to a user library on the projects Java Build Path ?
   Libraries property page.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to more accurately check for the existence of the
   Web 2.0 feature pack.  The fix for this APAR is included in
   Rational Application Developer v8.0.4.1.
