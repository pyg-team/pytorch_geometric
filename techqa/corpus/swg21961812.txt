 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM SDK Java Technology Edition that is used by IBM Integration Designer (IID) and WebSphere Integration Developer (WID). These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015.

In addition, the LogJam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol also affects IBM Integration Designer (IID) and WebSphere Integration Developer (WID). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0478 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0478]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JCE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0488
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]
DESCRIPTION: Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
