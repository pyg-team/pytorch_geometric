APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The front-side timeout might trigger while DataPower waits for
   a back-end
   server response, if the back side timeout value is larger than
   the front-side timeout.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increase the front-side timeout to the same value as, or larger
   than, the back side timeout.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are DataPower customers using Multi-Protocol Gateway
   (MPGW) or Web Services Proxy (WSP) with a front-side timeout set
   to a value smaller than the back side timeout.
   
   The front-side timeout should not fire if client has sent
   the entire message and is awaiting a backend server response.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 4.0.1.9 and 4.0.2.5
