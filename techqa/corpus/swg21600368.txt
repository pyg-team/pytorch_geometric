Title: IBM The Application Build ID is 'Unknown' if the SCA module for WebSphere Process Server (WPS) is installed as a WAR file - United States

Text:
Application Build ID Unknown; Implementation-Version TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A WAR or EAR application archive file contains a MANIFEST.MF, which includes a specific Implementation-Version attribute (for example, 4.1.0.0.9). When a web archive (WAR) file is installed using the WebSphere Administrative Console, the value of Application Build ID becomes 'Unknown' . 

SYMPTOM
When you install an application WAR file in the WebSphere Administrative Console, you will find the value of Application Build ID becomes 'Unknown' as shown in the following screen shot: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600368&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600368&aid=1] 


However, when you install the same application using an enterprise archive (EAR) file, the value of Application Build ID is the same as what is defined in the Implementation-Version attribute within the manifest.mf file. For example:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600368&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600368&aid=2]


CAUSE
The above behavior is working as designed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An Unknown Application Build ID is the designated value for a module file with the underlying WebSphere Application Server version. Beginning with WebSphere Application Server Version 8.0, this function has changed to show the Application Build ID for a module instead of an Unknown value.
