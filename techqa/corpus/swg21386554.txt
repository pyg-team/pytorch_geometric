Title: IBM Starting a licensed package based on Eclipse results in License key error - United States

Text:
Installation Manager; IM; license; multiple Rational products; same package group; Eclipse shell; RATLC00565367 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to start a licensed Eclipse based package, such as IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, that is installed in the same package group with unlicensed Eclipse based package result in a "License Cannot Be Found" error. 

SYMPTOM
The full error message is as follows:

The "IBM product" license key cannot be found.



Note: "IBM product" refers to a package group in your environment.

CAUSE
With older versions of packages based on Eclipse, you can have both licensed and unlicensed packages in the same package group. This is known as shell sharing. Unlicensed packages do not load the Eclipse shell, resulting in an unreliable configuration.


With IBM Installation Manager 1.2 and later, packages must be in a reliable configuration. The unlicensed packages must be licensed or uninstalled.

For example, Rational Software Architect (RSA) 7.0 and Rational Data Architect (RDA) 7.0 are installed in the same package group. You receive a message about a missing RSA license when starting RDA. This message is displayed because one Eclipse shell is hosting both the RDA package and the RSA package and both of these packages are active.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Take one of the following actions on the unlicensed package. 

 

 1. Click Manage Licenses to Apply License
    
    
 2. Uninstall the package
    
    
 3. Exit Workbench


Avoid referencing components from an unlicensed package in Eclipse workspaces and projects as erratic behaviour can occur.
