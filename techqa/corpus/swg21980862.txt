Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I'd like to be able to format the ERROR001.LOG and TRACE001.LOG that is produced when I enable the IWPM Trace Utility. How might I do this? 

ANSWER
The steps are listed below: 

1. Go to a DOS command prompt by clicking on "Start, Run", then typing CMD. 

2. Switch to the IWPM installation directory (e.g., c:\evn\bin) 

3. Run FIWSRASF by specifying the input file name (which is usually stored in c:\evn\bin\log), followed by the output file name ending with "txt", separated by the > symbol. For example: 

 * 
 * 


Perform the same operation for both the error log and the trace log. See the example below:  

 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980862&amp;aid=1]

4. The resulting error001.txt and trace001.txt files can be opened with a Windows text editor.
