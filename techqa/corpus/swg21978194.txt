Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A GNU C library (glibc) stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo() vulnerability affects Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment and Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547] 
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVSS: 
CVSS Base Score: 8.1

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)


AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images 7.1.1.x
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment 7.1.1.x 
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images (and System X Edition) 7.1.1.x

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Customers using IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment 7.1.1x or IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Images 7.1.1.x should apply the IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment/Images Fix Pack 20 (7.1.1.20) or later. 

The latest Fix Packs are available at this link: http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral].

After the updates have been applied, any process using glibc must be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc; rebooting of targets that are in idle state and that display label “Linux DE” at bottom right, after upgrading is suggested. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.
