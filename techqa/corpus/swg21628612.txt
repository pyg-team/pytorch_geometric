QUESTION
What causes a Vulnerability Scanner to show a large list of vulnerabilities when scanning Lotus Protector?

ANSWER
Often, the tests that Vulnerability Scanners are doing are not probing if the appropriate service is actually vulnerable, but they are just looking at the version number of the installed packages (e.g. 'rpm -q apache2' or trying to get the version information when connecting to the service) and then comparing it against a database. 
Such a "Vulnerabilty Scan" does not take into account:

- that there might be an older version that has a backport of the appropriate fix
- that some modules are not loaded at all / that some functionality of the modules is not enabled

For its SuSE Enterprise Linux Novell/SuSE does usually not quickly jump to newer base versions of the packages but will stay on the base version of a package and fixes the vulnerability in that version (= backporting of a fix). 

There are several methods to check if the installed package is vulnerable to
a certain CVE:

1. Using the Novell Support Websites

- the underlaying OS of Lotus Protector is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10
x86
- get the info which version is installed
rpm -q packagename (e.g. openssh, apache2)
- use 'Google' to search for <cve-number> + Novell

You will usually find a web-page at support.novell.com where you will find information in which package the issue is fixed thoroughly
example: CVE-2007-4752

Result: Installed version = openssh-4.2p1-18.38.3 / problem fixed with
version >= openssh >= 4.2p1-18.30

2. Using the changelogs that are part of the installed packages

rpm -q -changelog <package-name> | grep -i <cve-number>

example a: check if the installed openssh package is vulnerable against
'OpenSSH X11 Cookie Local Authentication Bypass Vulnerability -
CVE-2007-4752'

rpm -q -changelog openssh | grep -i CVE-2007-4752

- fixed checking of an untrusted cookie, CVE-2007-4752 [#308521]

example b: check if the installed apache2 package is vulnerable against
'Apache Server 2.x Prior To 2.2.14 Multiple Vulnerabilities - '

rpm -q -changelog apache2 | grep -i -E "(CVE-2009-3095|CVE-2009-3094)"

- fixed CVE-2009-3094 (The ap_proxy_ftp_handler function in
modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c in the
- fixed CVE-2009-3095 (access restriction bypass in mod_proxy_ftp module)

example c: sometimes a vulnerability is fixed in the associated library -->
'Apache APR and APR-util Multiple Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities -
CVE-2009-2412'

rpm -q -changelog libapr-util1 | grep -i CVE-2009-2412

- fixed Overflow flaw in apr_pool and apr_rmm APIs (CVE-2009-2412,

3. Checking which apache modules are loaded:

apache2ctl -t -D DUMP_MODULES

Loaded Modules:

Conclusion:
Doing vulnerability scans means to carefully go through the results and to try to find out which are valid findings and which are 'False Positives'. We do frequently do vulnerability scans with our product therefore it is very unlikely that there are old "CVE's" found which are NOT False Positives. If there are findings which seem to be real vulnerabilities of the product, please contact Technical Support.
