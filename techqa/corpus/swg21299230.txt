PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Locating the WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) abend files. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Locating abend files

When a process ends abnormally (an abend or dump), an entry is made in the syslog, or the Windows Event log. If there is more data to be written than is appropriate for the log, a new file is created to contain it, and the log entry tells you the file name.

Windows 
Abend files 

The new file is called: filename.abend. 
 * If you have set the workpath using the -w parameter of the mqsicreatebroker command, the location is workpath\common\errors. 
 * If you have not specified the broker workpath, the workpath can be resolved by issuing the command echo %MQSI_WORKPATH% from the installation's Command Console. If it is not possible to write to this directory, the file is put in the workpath\common\log directory, but in either case the message in the Event Log tells you where to find it. 


Each abend file contains a header that includes the following sections:  * Product details (the broker product that is being used) 
 * Operating System 
 * Environment (including the installation path and the process ID that contains the failing thread) 
 * Deployment (including the component and, where applicable, the execution group name and UUIDs) 
 * Build Information (for IBM internal use) 
 * Failure Location (including the time of failure and, where applicable, the message flow name) Back to top

Abend files 

The new file is called: filename.abend in the /var/mqsi/common/errors directory.

z/OS 
Abend files 

The new file is called: filename.abend in the /component_HFS/common/errors directory. 
where filename is a unique dynamically-allocated name, as given in the syslog or joblog message. 
The abend file typically provides stack output for the failing thread; this might help you to identify problems in code within a user defined node when an abend occurs here. The stack trace may also be available in a CEEDUMP file in the same directory as the abend file by default. 

Each abend file contains a header that includes the following sections:  * Product details (the broker product that is being used) 
 * Operating System 
 * Environment (including the installation path and the process ID that contains the failing thread) 
 * Deployment (including the component and, where applicable, the execution group name and UUIDs) 
 * Build Information (for IBM internal use) 
 * Failure Location (including the time of failure and, where applicable, the message flow name)
