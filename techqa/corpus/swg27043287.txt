ABSTRACT
 IBM Atlas Policy Suite does not include custodians added from the Request > People in Scope page as default recipients for bulk collection notices.

This is working as designed. 

Bulk collection notices are sent to persons with the IT Staff role, and are
precursors to individual collection or preservation plans.


For bulk collection notices, users must be manually added to the notice.
