APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The RESUMABLE_DASHBOARDS attribute of a Process Portal session
   is not serializable.  As a result, an error similar to the
   following is written to SystemOut.log on the server or cluster
   where the IBM_BPM_Portal application is deployed:
   
   WASSession    E SessionContextMBeanAdapter
   findAttCausingNotSerializableException
   Miscellaneous data: Attribute "RESUMABLE_DASHBOARDS" is
   declared to be serializable but is found to generate exception
   "java.io.NotSerializableException" with message
   "com.lombardisoftware.component.common.web.WebWorkflowManagerRes
   ult".  Fix the application so that the attribute
   "RESUMABLE_DASHBOARDS" is correctly serializable at runtime.
   
   This error has been observed in conjunction with the WebSphere
   Application Server session replication function (allowing a
   web session to  be persisted in a clustered network deployment
   environment, such that if the cluster member where the session
   is running fails, the session automatically resumes through
   another cluster member), but also in other scenarios where
   session replication is not being used. The attribute needs to
   be made serializable to eliminate this error.

   A session variable is not serializable, causing an exception
   to be thrown when the variable needs to be serialized, such as
   during memory to memory replication.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The RESUMABLE_DASHBOARDS attribute was made serializable.
