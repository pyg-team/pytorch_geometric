APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PMR NO: 12827,7TD,000
   APAR SEV: 3
   COMPID: 5724C04LN
   REL: 6.30.04.00
   Symptom Code: IN
   Symptom Key Word: INCORROUT
   
   Problem:
    Several status codes are defined for the fcp_daemon internal
   status
    (DAEMON_STARTED,DAEMON_STOPPED,DAEMON_ERROR etc.).
   
   They are expected  to be set in the Status Code attribute of
   the Custom Scripts attribute  group for the row identifying the
   overall status of the scripting feature itself. If the
   fcp_daemon does not stay running, then no rows at all are
   returned for this group making it impossible to be alerted on
   issues with the scripting feature, including the condition that
   it is not enabled.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
    Linux agent at version 6.30 FP4
   
   Diagnostics:
    KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL) (UNIT:klzmain ALL)
   (UNIT:kralz34 ALL)
    (UNIT:klz34 ALL)(UNIT:kralz35 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL)
   
   Initial Impact:
    Medium, situations based on the status of the scripting
   feature do not work
   
   Additional Keywords:
    KUXSCRPTS
    STSCODE
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define a situation for the fcp_daemon missing process, as a
   workaround  if you need to be alerted on the scripting feature
   not being enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In the Custom Scripts attribute group the Status Code attribute
   is expected to provide the overall status of the internal
   daemon that supports the scripting feature, in addition to the
   status from each custom script configured.  Actually, only the
   normal status, DAEMON_STARTED, is currently returned. No rows
   at all are provided in case the feature is not enabled or it is
   malfunctioning.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Conclusion: Code fixed such that a row of data is always
   returned, even if the feature is not enabled, with the proper
   status information.
