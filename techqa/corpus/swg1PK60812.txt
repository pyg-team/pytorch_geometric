ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using themes from portal 5.1.X into their portal 6
   env.
   
   Customer stated that there is an issue with url link created
   for their portal navigation.  They stated that on their theme
   that has a search button they see that the name of the links
   display but are not links, just text.

   on" prefix="portal-navigation" %>
   <%@ taglib
   uri="http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/portal/v6.0/portal-
   logic"
   prefix="portal-logic" %>
   
     <portal-navigation:navigationUrl screenTemplate="Home"
   type="link"
   var="myURL">
       <%
                           java.io.Writer w = new
   java.io.StringWriter();
                           myURL.writeDispose(w);
                           selectURL = w.toString();
