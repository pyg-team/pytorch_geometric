ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APM 8.1.4 min server crashes often due to WAS agent
   
   Debug :
   
   1.enable the AAR file(was agent ):
       1.1 set logging for AAR
          Enable the logging of AARs by setting the following in
   the
   tfe.cfg ( for linux /home/ibm/apm/agent/localconfig/yn) file:
          ENABLE_AAR_LOGGING=true
      1.2 check log file :
          /opt/ibm/apm/agent/lx8266/yn/aar.txt
    2. run the pdcollector tool to collect logs .
   
   for the WAS agent side,we got the result as below:
   From the latest AAR files,we have another investigate, we have
   different handle for different components type  of the
   transaction, for the customer's env,the component type such as
   Http Request  have the large url which including the query
   parameters. AAR key context is as below:
   "interactionContext": {
       "componentName": "HTTP Request",
       "serverName": "msnurmid11.ussco.com",
       "transactionName":
   
   The data is exact .If the server side need the agent not
   include the query parameters to keep the db capacity,We will
   change for that. next to do :
   we need to do the code change and make test regression
   
   we will make a patch with was agent IFix01(07.30.14.01)
