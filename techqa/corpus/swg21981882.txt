Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I set Interview to Yes when Matters are imported using Atlas Extensions? 

CAUSE
Matters are always imported with the Interview option set to "No"

ANSWER
 

There is no option to default Interview to "Yes" in a Atlas Matter using the User Interface. 

For Matters imported using the Atlas Extensions, you can set the "INTERVIEWREQUIRED" column to "Y" when you select from the atlas_matter or the source table in the MatterDBPullerAgent.xml file found in <atlas_Install_folder>/Atlas/Properties/defaultimpl/db folder. 

A restart of the Atlas application server is required after you make the change
