APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 24 installed for example on
   Macintosh OSX 10.12 Sierra. The program works fine.
   You also have used the SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 interactive
   installer to upgrade the path level.
   After installation of the FixPack the program also works fine.
   You click on "About SPSS Statistics" dialog and the the release
   being displayed is correctly shown as 24.0.0.2 64 bit edition.
   
   Next, open Finder and go to
   /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24 folder
   
   When you left click on SPSSStatistics.app you see however the
   version is displayed as 24.0.0.1 (as you have installed fixpack
   1 installed some months ago).
   
   Furthermore you right click on SPSSStatistics.app and select
   "show package content". Open Contents folder
   Locate info.plist file and open it. The content is also
   displayed on Finder.
   The content of info.plist also shows the incorrect version
   24.0.0.1 and not 24.0.0.2.
   
   On another mac you tested as well using the silent installer
   file for the 24 FP2 for Mac but see the same issue after silent
   installation. The version is not correct for info-plist file and
   SPSSStatistics.app but correct on SPSS 24 dialog "About
   SPSSStatistics"
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. Please note you can
   ignore the wrong version on info.plist file. The fixpack is
   installed and the wrong version display has no effect on
   functionality. On menu About SPSS Statistics the version is
   correctly displayed as 24.0.0.2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a future release of SPSS
   Statistics.

   * Fixpack 1.                                                   *

   * was release IBM  SPSS Statistics 25 Fixpack 1 for Mac.       *
   *                                                              *

   * The defect is verified and closed against 25 FP1 and so the  *
   * APAR is closed with the first release that has the fix,      *
   * which is 25 FP1.                                             *
