Text:
WebQuery 5733WQX V2R2M0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to IBM DB2 Web Query for i V2R2M0 customers might encounter issues with their old schedules. 

Upon a open attempt of a schedule in Web Query they may hit an error stating 

"Error loading the schedule: "undefined(<!DOCTYPE html> <HTML> <HEAD> <title>500 - Application Server Error..."


SYMPTOM
Upon a open attempt in Web Query they may hit an error stating 

"Error loading the schedule: undefined(<!DOCTYPE html> <HTML> <HEAD> <title>500 - Application Server Error..." 

 

Here is a screen shot

Even if a new schedule is created on any existing reports or newly created ones the similar error is received when they try to schedule it:

"Failed to retrieve the properties of the report... "

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021893&amp;aid=2]



Note: 
All ports will be active, 
Web Query starts fine and they are able to log in and out of the BI portal, 
Health Checker will be clean,
There are no indications why this might be happening in the event.log.


CAUSE
Some old files might be cached after upgrading



ENVIRONMENT
Web Query 2.2.0 (after upgrading to WebQuery 2.2.0 from a previous release) 

BI Portal (i.e. the 12331 URL)


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Errors in Web Query while they attempt to open a schedule



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Although is seems unrelated this can be fixed if you simply clears their browser cache 

 
- the reason this happens is that some old files might be cached after upgrading. 
This has a very high success rate so far. 

If they test it with Developer WorkBench it will work fine - they will be able to open the scheduler and/or edit, this might be used as a circumvention if clearing the browser cache does not work
