Title: IBM Why is wlmadmin not updating the number of tokens? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My organization is using SPSS for Windows version 13 or higher with a network license. Everything concerning the licensing and operation of the product is functioning properly. The problem is that I am trying to update the number of tokens available for SPSS Base. I've re-run the License Authorization Wizard with a new authorization code I have received from SPSS Customer Service for a different number of users, and it appears to have run correctly, but when I re-start the WlmAdmin utility, I still see the old number of tokens.

How can we update the number of tokens? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is happening because the license line for the original number of tokens is still present in the LSERVRC license file, and presumably hasn't expired - adding a new license line for the same product doesn't replace any that might be present already. And since the license manager has already loaded the first line it read for that product, it ignores any that might come after.

To add more users or replace an existing license, the easiest method is to locate LSERVRC file in the SPSS Sentinel LM directory, re-name it, and re-run the License Authorization Wizard with all of your intended authorization codes. That will re-create a fresh LSERVRC file. Then re-start your Sentinel LM service
