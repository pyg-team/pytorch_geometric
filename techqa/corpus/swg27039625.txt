Ask the Experts session 
07 November 2013 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EST 

Time Questions asked 00:00 General introduction 02:58 Technical introduction (What are WMQ MFT Resource Monitors?) 10:21 How to configure a basic resource monitor? 17:01 How to customize resource monitor tasks with variable substitution? 20:46 What user ID authorization is required for managed file transfer clients and resource monitors? 22:24 What to do if matching resources are available for a defined file resource monitor, but the files never get moved to the destination agent, and transfers end up in ‘resynchronizing’ state? 23:35 What to do if destination files transferred by a queue resource monitor contain the wrong data? 25:30 Open lines for live question and answer period 25:36 Sometimes when shutting down an active agent, MQ Explorer shows as many as 9 transfers in progress, but yet all transfers seem to have completed. What could cause this behavior? 28:52 How do you monitor a queue that is outside the FTE topology? 32:09 In MQ Explorer plugin there is a stop/started status for a monitor. In the document there is nothing about stopping a monitor, is this something that will come at a later time? 33:10 Do we need to have QMGR also to establish FTE? 33:49 If we have to call multiple commanda in the same monitor, is there anyway to achive that functionality? 34:37 We are having issues with transfers backing up normally do to file locking on I/5 systems. Other then increasing the source and destinations settings and canceling with ANT, is this somethign known that can be fixed? 36:29 what is the maximum size of file FTE can transfer? 37:16 How to monitor agents for availability? Any recommendatons for setting up agents and monitors in a High Availability system? 39:32 Closing remarks 40:41 End of Call
