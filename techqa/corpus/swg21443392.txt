Title: IBM Data Stage throws "Unexpected Network Error" message - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Data Stage is used with ODBC to load the data in a non-logging database, it throws "Unexpected Network Error" message. 

SYMPTOM
Data Stage log will contain the following error message:

ODBC_Connector_18: ODBC function "SQLPrepare" reported: SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -95: Msg = [IBM(DataDirect OEM)][ODBC Informix Wire Protocol driver][Informix]Unexpected Network Error.


CAUSE
Data Stage uses transactions to load and unload the data from the database. So the logging (buffered or unbuffered) on database must be turned ON.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the logging status of the database using onmonitor (Use Menu options: Status -> Databases)
OR 
Use the following SQL to check the logging status of the database using dbaccess

database sysmaster;

select name,
is_logging
from sysdatabases
where name = "<database_name>";



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the logging status of the database is no-log then change it to either unbuffered or buffered logging.
