PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When users try to login to IBM Case Manager Client, the login page does not have the IBM Case Manager logo and trademark information. After successfully logging in to IBM Case Manager Client, the user does not see the IBM Case Manager information in the banner. 

SYMPTOM
Some files and folders are missing from the WebDAV filestore.


CAUSE
The user who launched the IBM Case Manager administration client did not have read, write and execute permissions to the folders and files under the <ICM_HOME> and <WAS_HOME> directories. 

Where:
<ICM_HOME> represents the IBM Case Manager installation directory
<WAS_HOME> represents the WebSphere® Application Server installation directory

and the user or group's full access permissions means read, write, and execute permissions


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the user that runs the IBM Case Manager administration client has read, write, and execute permissions to the folders and files under the <ICM_HOME> and <WAS_HOME> directories. 


For example, in environments with Windows operating systems, right click on the administration client program or its shortcut and select the "Run as Administrator" option to launch it. Then execute the administration client tasks to make sure that this user has full access permissions to the relevant directory structure.

In environments with non-Windows operating systems, make sure that the AIX, Linux, or Solaris user you use to launch the administration client, or the group that this user belongs to, has full access permissions to the folder and files of the relevant directories.

Where:
<ICM_HOME> represents the IBM Case Manager installation directory
<WAS_HOME> represents the WebSphere® Application Server installation directory

and the user or group full access permissions means read, write, and execute permissions
