Windows Error; Heartbeat 0x2471 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you resolve a Windows Server 2003 R2 Error, code 0x2471: The requested address is not valid in its context? 

CAUSE
The ability for the name to resolve is going to depend on how your DNS server is configured and the location of the agent that is trying to register. Essentially, the hostname or IP Address that the system attempted to bind to was non-local. WinSock was trying to create a socket connection for a host name or IP it does not believe is local to the host.

For example: If the destination you created is in another domain than where you are located, unless trust is setup, then you would expect this to fail. If you do a lookup from the windows host, does that hostname MyHostName1 resolve back to an IP address? If it does return an IP Address, is that the expected IP Address for the local system? 

ANSWER
What you are hitting is a Microsoft error. You have a hostname that is defined, but Windows is sending back Error code 10049.https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/819124 [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/819124] 

In most cases, you can resolve this by either replacing the hostname MyHostName1 with an IP Address or a more hostname that has a better chance of resolving. Use an IP Address to resolve this issue for your destination.
