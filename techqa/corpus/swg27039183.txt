 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 To troubleshoot an IBM CMIS web application on Oracle WebLogic Server, you must manually change the logging level. 

CONTENT
IBM Content Navigator supports the IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager application on Oracle WebLogic Server. 

Important: Do not set debug logging unless instructed to do so to by IBM Software Support. If you do set debug level logging, reset the logging level after you resolve the problem. When you reset the logging level, you must redeploy the application. 

To manually change the logging level for a web application that will be deployed on Oracle Web Server:


 1. Open the /configure/files/config/weblogic/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ subdirectory of the IBM Content Navigator installation directory. 
    
 2. Edit the log4j.properties file in a text editor.
    
    The logging levels in log4j.properties file are, from the simplest to the most detailed, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG and TRACE.
    
    For example, to set debug logging in the log4j.properties file, change the first line of the log4j.properties file from:
    
    log4j.category.com.ibm.ecm=ERROR, ibmcmisAppender
    
    to 
    
    log4j.category.com.ibm.ecm=DEBUG, ibmcmisAppender
    
 3. Save your changes to the log4j.properties file.
    
 4. Configure the web application in the IBM Content Navigator Configuration and Deployment Tool. 




To manually change the logging level of an existing deployment: 
 1. Log in to the server where IBM Content Navigator is installed.
    
 2. Open the/configure/files/config/weblogic/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ subdirectory of the IBM Content Navigator installation directory. 
    
 3. Edit the log4j.properties file in a text editor.
    
    The logging levels in log4j.properties file are, from the simplest to the most detailed, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG and TRACE.
    
    For example, to set debug logging in the log4j.properties file, change the first line of the log4j.properties file from:
    
    log4j.category.com.ibm.ecm=ERROR, ibmcmisAppender
    
    to 
    
    log4j.category.com.ibm.ecm=DEBUG, ibmcmisAppender
    
 4. Save your changes to the log4j.properties file.
    
 5. Open the IBM Content Navigator Configuration and Deployment Tool and rebuild and redeploy the application. For more information, see Updating a deployment [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r2m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucde024.htm].
