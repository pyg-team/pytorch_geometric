QUESTION
 How do I parse a single domain field to analyze and classify data? 

ANSWER
The Character Investigate option parses a single-domain field (one that contains one data element or token, such as SSN, telephone number, date, or ZIP code) to analyze and classify data. 
- Single Domain Fields are categorized as either Entity Identifiers or Entity Clarifiers: 

 *  Entity Identifiers - Examples include ZIP Code (U.S. postal code), Social Security Number (SSN), TIN, and telephone numbers. These can serve as critical match fields if their quality is high. These fields typically have a specific format (such as 9-digit numeric for SSN, or Alpha-Numeric-Alpha-Numeric-Alpha-Numeric for Canadian postal code). Character Discrete Investigate is commonly used, with the mask set to all Cs. 
 *  Entity Clarifiers - Examples include name prefix, gender, and marital status. This type of field usually has a limited number of known values. Character Discrete Investigate is commonly used, with the mask set to all Ts. 
 * They are typically used for a single purpose. 
 * They can exist in several common formats. 
 * No parsing is usually necessary. 
 * They can serve as strong blocking and match fields if quality is high. 
 * The Standardize Stage usually only requires removal of special characters, creation of a common default value and format and concatenating data.


- Character investigation provides you with the option of investigating multiple columns individually (Character Discrete) or integrated as one unit of data (Character Concatenate). Free-form columns often contain multiple (usually related) data elements such as person names, business names, or postal addresses. For free-form columns, the unique values can represent individual tokens (words) that are determined by parsing the free-form data or lexical patterns providing context to help understand the free-form data. 

- The Character Discrete Investigate analyzes multiple single-domain columns. This option allows you to investigate a large number of columns with little effort. A Character Discrete Investigate produces a column frequency report that treats each column as a separate token for frequency count and analysis. 

- The Character Concatenate Investigate option performs cross-column correlations between multiple columns to determine relationships. With this option, you select two or more columns from anywhere in the record (the columns do not have to be contiguous) to be investigated as a single data column. To create the pattern analysis, the tokens are concatenated with no spaces between the tokens. 

The investigation process generates a column frequency report that presents information about frequency values for a specific column. A pattern report is prepared for all types of investigations and displays the count, percentage of data that matches this pattern, the generated pattern, and sample data. This output can be presented in a wide range of formats to conform to standard reporting tools.
