APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The JSESSIONID cookie is to be revoked upon logout, but the
   cookie modification code does not always set the correct cookie
   path. In this case, browsers will ignore the cookie change and
   send the outdated cookie in further requests. With external
   security authentication, this can lead to misinterpretation of
   a session timeout scenario so that portal session suspend and
   resume is not triggered during login.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The JSESSIONID cookie is to be revoked upon logout, but the
   cookie modification code does not always set the correct cookie
   path. In this case browsers will ignore the cookie change and
   send the outdated cookie in further requests. With external
   security authentication, this can lead to misinterpretation of a
   session timeout scenario so that portal session suspend and
   resume is not triggered during login.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The path entry for cookie modification is correctly handled with
   this APAR.
