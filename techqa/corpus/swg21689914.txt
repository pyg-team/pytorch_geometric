AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects some versions and releases of IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

Note that other related products are also affected by this vulnerability. In the context of applying fixes, you will also want to update Installation Manager to version 1.8 or later.

To fully mitigate the POODLE vulnerability for server side components, an additional fix for IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer is required (JR51720): 

 * WebSphere Integration Developer V7.5.1.2 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Integration+Designer&release=7.5.1.2&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR51720] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.0.1.3 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Integration+Designer&release=8.0.1.3&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR51720] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.5.0 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Integration+Designer&release=8.5.5&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR51720]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
