ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Migrating WebSphere on z/OS can fail due to port various
   restrictions being enforced on the system.  This can result in
   either the create profile step for a DMGR migration to fail or
   Federated Node processes to fail starting after being migrated.
   A DMGR migration failure will show the following symptoms:
       CRPROF Step fails with:
       INSTCONFPARTIALSUCCESS: The profile
         now exists, but errors occurred. manageprofiles.sh failed
   Also,
   DeploymentManager/logs/manageprofiles/default_create.log.
      <message>java.net.SocketException: EDC5111I Permission
   denied. at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketListen(Native Method)
   ...
       <message>Task stopped for: resolvePortsWithRecommendedValues
   -FAILURE
   A Federated Node migration failure will show the following
   symptoms:
   Various error messages about ports already in use, or unable to
   use a port in the WebSphere server logs or INSUFFICIENT ACCESS
   AUTHORITY RACF system messages related to ports.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact WebSphere L2 Support for manual steps and a script to
   use to work with 'limited' port # choices.
