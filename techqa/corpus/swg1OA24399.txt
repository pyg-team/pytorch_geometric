APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  KMQ can't handle 2 subnode registrations at the same time when
   the 2 different queue managers are monitoring the QSG
   
   Problem occurs when the two agents are trying to join at the
   same time.
   XXX0 successfully joins and thinks it is the agent monitoring
   the QSG.
   However, because XXX1 incorrectly registers the QSG subnode
   (MQYY:MQQSG), the requests for QSG data are incorrectly going
   to XXX1.
