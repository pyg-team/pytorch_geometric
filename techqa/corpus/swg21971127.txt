 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is the Front End Load Balancer ( FELB ) not forwarding a client IP address to a backend? 

ANSWER
This is a known limitation in the current implementation of haproxy ( FELB ), especially with the layer 7 where SSL termination is handled.
Notice that forwarding a client IP address to a backend works when the FELB is setup to use non-SSL configuration.
