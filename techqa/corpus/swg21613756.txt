QUESTION
 How to identify a table which has been parked automatically by CDC I Series as source? 

ANSWER
Whenever CDC comes across situations where it believed that state of object is not correct and it can't be part of mirroring anymore CDC will mark the table as parked. This event would take place without any visual notification but in source eventlogs for iSeries CDC would notify this change using event 45.
Event Id: 45 
Mirror has been disabled for library/Object member XYZ to target system. 

In order to fix this issue the subscription must be stopped and object should be refreshed following steps below: 

 * Review and identify if journaling was disabled or enabled on in scope object or table has gone through DDL maintenance. Ensure journaling is re-enabled incase if it was disabled. 
 * Perform update table definition on this object by right clicking on suspected object in Management Console configuration tab. 
 * Change replication scope to Mirror / Refresh for this table. 
 * Restart Mirroring.
