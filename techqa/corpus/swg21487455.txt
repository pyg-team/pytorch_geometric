Title: IBM Error installing Sentinel LM on Windows  2008 Server x64 edition - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing Sentinel RMS License Manager 8.2.2 from Modeler I get the following error:

"Windows cannot find ':\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Safenet Sentinel\Sentinel System Driver\InstParLauncher.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."

This is seen on both Windows 2008 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and a fix has been added to remove the error message altogether. This fix will be included in the next release of Modeler. 

Please note that regardless of the error the installation appears to work correctly and can be ignored. This was seen on Windows 7 and Windows 2008 (64-bit), but does not occur on Windows 7 32-bit.

SPSS would like to apologise for any confusion this may have caused
