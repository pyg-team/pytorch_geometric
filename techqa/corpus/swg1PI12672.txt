ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z (RDz): RDz 8.5.1.1, COBOL
   Editor with Format action incorrectly formats the COBOL file
   ***************************************************************
   Rational Developer for System z (RDz): 'Format Source Code'
   option in the 'Save Actions' for COBOL Editor incorrectly
   formats
   the COBOL file if executed while initial copybook download in
   progress. So, comment lines and Value clauses are corrupted
   because they are wrongly changed to lower or upper case.
   ***************************************************************
   Local fix:
   Do not use the 'Format Source code' option while the editor
   is still downloading the COBOL copybooks.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While the Save Action > Format  does wait for the copybooks to
   get resolved before formatting the file content, it then doesn't
   wait for the initial document changes made before the save was
   invoked to also get resolved.  So in effect it is formatting the
   document as if it didn't have the extra lines of comments in
   it... which causes the alignment to go off.  The fix is to wait
   for the both the initial copybooks to be resolved and any
   unsaved changes to be processed by the parser before attempting
   to format the document.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Save Actions > Format behavior has been updated to wait for
   both the copy statements to get resolved as well as any interim
   file modifications to also get resolved and integrated into the
   language model prior to applying any formatting changes to the
   document.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
