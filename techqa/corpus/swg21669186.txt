Text:
WebSphere; IHS; upgrade; startup; WAN Server; 8.0.x TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational WAN Server might stop functioning after reboot of the server. 

SYMPTOM
CCRC clients are unable to connect after the WAN Server was rebooted.
System booted up fine, but the WAS and IHS servers did not start automatically. 


CAUSE
Unlike the 7.1.X install, the startup scripts for WAS and IHS are not configured on the server.

ENVIRONMENT
Recent install of WAS 8.5 and CCRC WAN server 8.0.x on a server.
After the initial install, your clients were able to connect via CTE client. 


After the WAN Server was rebooted, the clients cannot connect.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if WebSphere is running with ps -af | grep Web 

Check if WAN Server is running with 

ps -af | grep ccrc


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you want to have WebSphere and IHS to start automatically, you will have to add scripts to start.

cd /opt/ibm/RationalSDLC/common/ccrcprofile/bin
./startServer.sh server1
then ihs
/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/apachectl start 

 

You can, if you wish, copy the ewas_boot and ihs_boot files from the 7.1 installation and use them to start WebSphere and IHS.
