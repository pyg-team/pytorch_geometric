Title: IBM After upgrading to OMNIBus Web GUI 7.4 FP6 or 8.1 FP7, the CGI registry appears as empty on Windows systems, and CGI tools will not function - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If Web GUI 7.4 FP6 or 8.1 FP7 is installed in a Windows environment, the CGI registry might appear as corrupted, due to a fix for IV85024 that addresses a problem with the syntax of the "cgi.group" file. 
In turn, the CGI registry page will display no registered CGI script.
The CGI tools will appear, but cannot run. 


SYMPTOM
The CGI registry will look "empty" and CGI-related error logs entries may occur on Web GUI startup.


CAUSE
As a consequence of the fix for APAR IV85024, the syntax for Windows-based paths in the cgi.group file now requires double-escaping the file separator. 

The cgi.group is located in %WEBGUI_HOME%\etc\cgi, e.g. C:\IBM\Tivoli\Netcool\omnibus_webgui\etc\cgi.

The fix itself addresses this issue by preventing further corruption of the resource, but it does not repair the cgi.group file itself. 

Upgrading Web GUI from any version prior to 7.4 FP6 or 8.1 FP7 on Windows implies a cleanup of the cgi.group file, as described in the notes for APAR IV85024.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to sanitize the cgi.group file located in %WEBGUI_HOME%\etc\cgi (e.g. C:\IBM\Tivoli\Netcool\omnibus_webgui\etc\cgi), proceed as follows: 



 1. Stop Web GUI
 2. 
 3. Open the cgi.group file in a text editor
 4. 
 5. Replace all single back-slashes in file names with a double back-slash, ensuring only single back-slashes are being replaced.
    For instance, in an editor supporting Perl-based regular expressions:  * 
     * Search for (?<!\\)\\(?!\\)
     * 
     * Replace with \\\\
     * 
     * Save the file
     * 
     * Bear in mind the desired result: all back slashes in Windows paths should be escaped, e.g. C:\IBM\Tivoli\Netcool\omnibus_webgui\etc\cgi-bin\myCGI.cgi should become: C:\\IBM\\Tivoli\\Netcool\\omnibus_webgui\\etc\\cgi-bin\\myCGI.cgi
    
    
    
 6. Start Web GUI again
