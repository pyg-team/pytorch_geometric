     *  After you download the executable file, rename it to match your platform: For example, db2.zip on Windows; db2.tar.gz on AIX or Linux.
       
       
     *   On some Windows machines, the file extensions might be hidden by default. In that case, open Windows Explorer and choose Organize > Folder and search options. In the Folder Options dialog box, click the View tab, clear the Hide extensions for known file types check box, and then click Apply. Displaying the file extensions ensures that you don't accidentally rename the DB2 package for Windows to db2.exe.zip.
