 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am receiving errors when trying to install a FileNet Content Manager 5.2.1 environment on RedHat Enterprise Linux 7 or above using the Composite Platform Installation Tool (CPIT) 5.2.1. The installation is breaking when trying to install IBM Tivoli Directory Server (ITDS) 6.3 which is required for the installation to complete successfully. 

ANSWER
Unfortunately ITDS 6.3 is not supported on RHEL 7 as per the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports for the product. Consequently, as CPIT 5.2.1 requires ITDS 6.3, running CPIT 5.2.1 on RHEL 7 is not a supported configuration.
