QUESTION
 How to Change the Media Speed of a Host Ethernet Adapter? 

ANSWER
 

We just have to make the change on the GUI and don’t have to do anything from the command line. To do this we will do the following steps.

Step1: Highlight the System Management on the left hand side and make sure you do not have any lpars selected.

Step2: Under Tasks on the bottom right expand Hardware Information. Then expand Adapters. You should see Host Ethernet and that’s what we want to select.

Step3: This should bring up another window showing us the physical ports available that we can configure. We want to select the physical port we want to configure with the new media speed setting. Once we select it we also want to select configure to make the change.

Step4: Here is where we can change the media speed for this physical port. In our example we are going to select 10 Mbps using Full Duplex. After we make the change we want to hit OK to save the profile.

Step5: We want to hit OK again because if you notice under where it shows the media speed it’s still set to 100 instead of 10 Mbps. So in order for the change to take affect we need to OK on this menu as well.

Step6: Now we will go back and select Host Ethernet Adapter again. This shall bring up the window showing the physical ports and this time notice that the new Media Speed is set accordingly.
