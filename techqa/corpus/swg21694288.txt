Text:
CVE-2014-3570; CVE-2014-3572; CVE-2015-0204 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. OpenSSL is used by Rational ClearCase. Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions:



Version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.7 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.14 Affected 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.17 Affected 
Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: 
 1. You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest V2 (perl-based) integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    
 2. You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
    
 3. You use the Change Management Integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a change management server.
    Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
    
 4. You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections. In this situation, you should review all the fixes provided by the OpenSSL project to see which ones apply to your use of OpenSSL. See the references link below.

Note: other components of ClearCase are subject to the "FREAK" attack, as disclosed in the following security bulletins: 
Security Bulletin: A security vulnerability has been identified in IBM WebSphere Application Server shipped with IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0138) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698831] 
Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0138) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698750] 
Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java Runtime affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0138, CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0410) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698749] REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to update to the latest fix pack. This fix pack includes OpenSSL 1.0.1m.



Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.7 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 8 (8.0.1.8) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039865] 8.0 through 8.0.0.14 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 15 (8.0.0.15) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039863] 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.17 
7.1.1.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.0.x (all fix packs) Customers on extended support contracts should install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 18 (7.1.2.18) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039861] 
You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. For unsupported versions, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable the ClearCase/ClearQuest integration and any customized defined use of ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl with SSL until you apply the fixes listed above.
