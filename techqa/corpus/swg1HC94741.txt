ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CoreDump due to performance/memory problem during creation
   drawing from assembly
   When the customer tries to extract a view of a very large
   assembly the machine tries for 20-30 minutes but then
   returns an empty view with a red 'X' through it.  The icon
   next to the view name in the tree indicates that it needs to
   be updated.  Updating leads to the same result.  The
   assembly is of simple geometry, just steel beams and
   plates.  The problem is that there are literally thousands
   and thousands of holes in the beams and plates and CATIA
   cannot seem to handle it.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   CoreDump due to performance/memory problem
   during creation drawing from assembly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   An enhancement is now available on R10 and
   R9 SP3 for view generation from big assembly.
   It uses the graphical representation of 3D geometry
   (.cgr files), see the documentation
   Generative Drafting / What's new / Generating CGR Views
   to inquire about use and limitation.
   When working on R9, you have to export a
   specific environment variable to activate this functionality:
   export DrwDevCGR=1
   With this enhancement, I could create a front view xy
   from your assembly. Here is the new methodology I used :
   - Launch CATIA
   - Tools / Options / Infrastructure
       activate "Work with the cache system"
       (you may have to restart CATIA)
   - Tools / Options / General / Display / Performance
       Modify the 3D accuracy from 0.2 to 5.0
       This parameter is used for visualization and
       CGR file creation, and defines the accuracy for
       graphical tesselation.
   - Tools / Mechanical Design / Drafting / Generation
       Activate "Generate view from CGR".
       You can also activate "Only generate parts larger than"
       and give a suitable value in order to filter the smallest
       elements, such as nut and bolt. This can be usefull
       to save memory.
   - Drafting / Front View / select a plane etc...
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  THIS APAR IS CONSIDERED AS A SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR
   CATIA.
   PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPORT DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO OPEN A
   REQUIREMENT FORM.
   
   Problem similar to APAR HC87682 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HC87682] HC89115 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HC89115] HC90551 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HC90551],
   This performance pb will not be solved on V5R8.
   We plan to be able to extract the view on V5R9SP3
   The postponing of the closure of this problem is due to the
   fact that all the enhancements brought by V5R8SP3 and V5R8SP4
   are not sufficient for allowing the generation of the drafting.
   The saving up of memory did not reach a sufficient level.
   There are really enhancements, which could allow other
   draftings, that failed before, to be now generated successfully
   but the gap of necessary improvement can be brought only by the
   development plan named  Polyhedron Hidden Lines Removal  ,
   started in V5R9 and targetted for V5R9SP3.
