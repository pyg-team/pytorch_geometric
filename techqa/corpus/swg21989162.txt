Title: IBM WTX TEXTTOBASE64() documented behaviour is different from the actual behaviour - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) ) documentation for the TEXTTOBASE64() function, an example is given using a literal, that no longer gives the documented answer when used. 

SYMPTOM
TEXTTOBASE64("Some Example Data")
Expected Output: U29tZSBFeGFtcGxlIERhdGE=
Actual Output : UwBvAG0AZQAgAEUAeABhAG0AcABsAGUAIABEAGEAdABhAA==


CAUSE
Since WTX 8.1, all literals are now stored in Unicode, the result will differ from the documented one.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) on any valid execution platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Reviewing the output, it can be seen that the BASE64 output is not as per expectations, however, it will successfully convert back to the original string.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the old behaviour is desired, you can store literals in a Typetree object (input or output) and reference that object in any functions doing binary conversions, such as TEXTTOBASE64().





The documentation will be changed to reflect this.
