APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A hold notice is setup with  an autoreminder. An original
   Notice is sent successfuly to a custodian. The custodian is
   later deleted from the notice or the email changed to an
   invalid one. The Autoreminder is kicked off as scheduled and
   goes into an Error state for this custodian. This causes the
   Noticesender task to keep trying to send the notice to the
   custodian which fills up the systemprocess log table with clob
   data.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Suspend the notice in question
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a notice recipient has an invalid email ID, each time the
   Notice Sender Task is run, an SMTP error is logged in the
   SystemProcessLog table, resulting in too many log messages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The log message is improved and redundant messages are no
   longer logged.
   This fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.7.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  A hot fix was delievered on 01/21/2014 to the customer.
