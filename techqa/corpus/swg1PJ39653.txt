ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  LDAP errors are occurring when performing functions related to
   the Content Engine (CE) and Process Engine (PE) as follows:
   #1) CE Functions:
   When a client attempts to open a document (also occurs on some
   folders) within Workplace they receive the error:
   Getting document content has failed. Null and are unable to
   access the requested document.
   The CE server SystemOut.log has the following error:
   
   EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception during
   invocation of method "executeSearch" on bean
   "BeanId(FileNetEngine#Engine-ejb-ws.jar#Engine, null)".
   Exception data:
   com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException:
   SECURITY_LDAP_PROVIDER_FAILED: LDAP Provider Access failed for
   principal '5D5543897'.
   Root cause: [LDAP: error code 12 - Unavailable Critical
   Extension]
   
   #2) PE Functions:
   When trying to open Process Designer via Workplace or starting
   up a Connection Point in AE, getting
   [LDAP: Error code 12 - Unavailable Critical Extension] messages,
   very similar to the LDAP errors we recieve when trying to Open
   Documents (#1 CE Functions: above).
   I have attached a document (PE BlueGroups LDAP error.doc) that
   contains the screen shots of these "PE LDAP error" messages.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In order for the Content Engine to return the LDAP results using
   paging mechanism, it leverages the Server Side Sorting (SSS)
   control from the directory server (this is a standard LDAP
   server implementation that is available with AD, Sun, Tivoli,
   etc.). When Server Side Sorting control is disabled on the
   Directory Server, Content Engine receives LDAP error 12.
