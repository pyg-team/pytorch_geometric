APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem has been duplicated locally in RPT 6.1.2.
   The customer's Web-based application doesn't work under RPT
   recording but does work if run in IE outside of RPT.
   We've been able to duplicate the behavior using their site.
   Their application requires changes to your java.policy file
   since it downloads an executable and then runs it on your
   machine.  The java.policy file changes are:
     permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.pathtemp",
   "read";
     permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.pathtemp}${/}*",
   "read,write,execute";
   Also had to add "-Duser.pathtemp=c:/tmp/abutmp" to the Java
   Runtime Parameters in my Java Plug-in Control Panel.
   If you don't have these changes, the customer's app won't run
   even without RPT.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customer is having difficulty doing a recording in RPT. RPT
   seem
   s to hang during the recording. The hang is related to
   attemptin
   g to run a Java applet which requires special
   security, as speci
   fied in the system's java.policy file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Since  the customer's Java applet requires a customized
   java.policy, the changes that they make to their system's
   java.policy need to be replicated in RPT's java.policy which
   is located in
   <install_directory>\eclipse\jre\lib\security
   directory, for example, C:\Program
   Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\eclipse\jre\lib\security.
   Once this change is made, need to restart Agent Controller.
   Then recording will work.
