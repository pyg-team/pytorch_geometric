ABSTRACT
 A new version of the Netcool/OMNIbus SNMP Probe will be available to download from March 12, 2015. 

CONTENT
 

This version of the probe has been updated to add the following functionality:

 * Host name resolution: The probe can now read details of resolved IP-host name pairs from a flat file at start-up to reduce the amount of network resources required to make DNS requests. 

It also incorporates fixes for the following APARs:

 * IV66556: The probe is not able to resolve $NODE to HOSTNAME 
 * IV68119: Memory free sequence is not complete
 * IV68690: nco_p_syntax fails to parse rules containing probe-specific functions, such as those from the SNMP probe (snmpget, snmpset)
