Title: IBM "Java exception occured - Native function: MjpiCheckJavaException" error using ITX JALE adapter with large IDocs - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) JALE adapter (from the ITX Pack for SAP R/3) it may be noted that transferring large IDocs to SAP fail with this error message - "Java exception occured - Native function: MjpiCheckJavaException". 

SYMPTOM
Audit log shows:

<Message>Java exception occured - Native function: MjpiCheckJavaException</Message>


CAUSE
The JVM heap (altered with the Xmx/Xms parameters) is too small. The IDoc typically require 4 to 5 times more memory than the size of the IDoc itself. So a 400MB IDoc for example may require an Xmx value of 2048MB or greater

ENVIRONMENT
Any executing environment using the JALE adapter in an ITX map

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review audit log for the error message above. Additional information can be found in the JNI Layer Trace (if activated in the dtx.ini file).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the following in the appropriate section of the dtx.ini file:

[JVM Options]
option1=-Xmx2048m 
option2=-Xms1024m
