Title: IBM Off-line managed systems do not appear in the TEP - United States

Text:
CDP_DP_INITIAL_CONFIG_DISCOVERY_NODE_STATE off-line offline agentless monitoring agent ITM subnodes down up appear TEP Tivoli Enterprise Portal TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the ITM Agentless agent does not show managed systems, that are currently unavailable, in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal? 

CAUSE
When CDP_DP_INITIAL_CONFIG_DISCOVERY_NODE_STATE is set to DOWN (which is the default), new nodes will not be registered until data is collected. This is the default behavior that has been introduced in 6.2.2 FP2 by APAR IZ71873. See link below:

ANSWER
You can revert back to the old behavior by setting the following parameter in the Agentless agent configuration file:
CDP_DP_INITIAL_CONFIG_DISCOVERY_NODE_STATE=UP

For example, for the Agentless Monitoring agent for Windows Operating Systems, you need to set the following value in KR2ENV (Windows) or r2.ini (Unix/Linux):
CDP_DP_INITIAL_CONFIG_DISCOVERY_NODE_STATE=UP
After that, reconfigure and restart the agent instance.
