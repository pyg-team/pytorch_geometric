INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Remediation Steps: Apply this interim fix to your environment. 


IBM has released a generally available interim fix to resolve several issues in Multi-Enterprise Integration Gateway. We recommend that all Multi-Enterprise Integration Gateway customers download this interim fix and apply it to their environments immediately.

• If you are not running a customer specific interim fix, you must apply this interim fix to resolve these issues. 

Note: You must already have V1.0, Fix Pack 1 installed, prior to applying Interim Fix 3. Interim fixes are cumulative, Interim Fix 3 includes the fixes for Interim Fixes 1 and 2. 
Follow the instructions below: 
1) Download the interim fix (filename: IBM_Multi-Enterprise_Integration_Gateway_V1.0.0.1_3_iFix_Media.zip) containing the resolutions for these issues from Fix Central. 
2) Install the interim fix on each node in your environment. Remember that applying this interim fix will require a node outage. IBM recommends that you apply the interim fix to your test environment first and run your regression tests against it before applying it to production.
