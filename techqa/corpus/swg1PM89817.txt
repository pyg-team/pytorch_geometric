APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently VMM uses SHA-1 hashing mechanism to hash the
   password while creating/login users in file registry. So if
   some one wants to hash a password with its own hahsing
   mechanism VMM doesnt allowed that.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5 virtual member manager (VMM)    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: File registry repository doesn't        *
   *                      support any custom hashing mechanism    *
   *                      for the passwords.                      *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Currently VMM uses SHA-1 hashing mechanism to hash the
   password while creating/login users in file registry. So if
   someone wants to hash a password with their own hashing
   mechanism VMM does not allow that.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  VMM now provides a mechanism through which custom hashing
   algorithm can be used for hashing the password apart from the
   default hashing mechanism.
   
   To use the custom hashing support these steps need to be
   followed:
   
   1. To support custom hashing algorithm VMM provides an
   interface named ICustomHashAlgo that you need to implement.
   2. You have to set a new custom property
   customHashImplClassName to provide the name of the
   implementation class.
   
   This implementation class will then be used at runtime for
   hashing the passwords of the user.
   
   $AdminTask setIdMgrCustomProperty {-id <repository_id>  -name
   customHashImplClassName -value <full_impl_class_name>}
   
   Here "repository_id " is the id of the file registry
   configured in VMM. "full_impl_class_name" is the name of the
   implementation class.
   Also save the configuration after running the previous command
   using:
   $AdminConfig save
   
   For example:
   $AdminTask setIdMgrCustomProperty {-id fileRepo  -name
   customHashImplClassName -value "com.ibm.custom.customImplClass"}
   
   3. The custom hashing algorithm implementation class will be
   loaded at runtime from the jar under which your
   implementation class is bundled which should be present under
   the WAS_HOME/lib/ext folder.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
