Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Netezza Host Management is affected by the vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown, which can enable CPU data cache timing to be abused to bypass conventional memory security restrictions to gain access to privileged memory that should be inaccessible. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-5753 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753]
DESCRIPTION: Intel Haswell Xeon, AMD PRO and ARM Cortex A57 CPUs could allow a local authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a bounds check bypass in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature. By conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cross the syscall boundary and read data from the CPU virtual memory.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137052 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137052] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-5754 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754]
DESCRIPTION: Intel Haswell Xeon, AMD PRO and ARM Cortex A57 CPUs could allow a local authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a rogue data cache load in the CPU speculative branch instruction execution feature. By conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the CPU to read kernel memory from userspace before the permission check for accessing an address is performed.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137053 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137053] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
