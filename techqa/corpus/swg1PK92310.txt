APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 7.0 is missing a description for the PluginInstallRoot
   plug-in property.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Documentation Issue -- No local fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects administrators who are    *
   *                  using WebSphere Application Server Version  *
   *                  7.0  to initialize the WebSphere HTTP       *
   *                  plug-in configuration file, which is the    *
   *                  plugin-cfg.xml file.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Information Centers for WebSphere   *
   *                      Application Server Version 7.0 do not   *
   *                      document PluginInstallRoot property as  *
   *                      part of the plugin-cfg.xml file.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Information Centers for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 7.0 do not document the configuration property
   element of the plugin-cfg.xml file, which is identified as,
   Property Name="PluginInstallRoot"
   Value="C:\IBM\WebSphere\Plugins
   
   If you want to install and configure WebSphere HTTP plug-ins,
   you need to identify the installation root for the
   installation process. Without specifying the PlugInstallRoot
   value in the plugin-cfg.xml file, the plug-in installation
   process fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "plugin-cfg.xml file" topic will be updated to explain the
   PluginInstallRoot property. The following information will be
   included to explain the property:
   
   Property Name="PluginInstallRoot"
   Value="C:\IBM\WebSphere\Plugins"
   This property provides the install path for the plugin. This
   is mandatory if using the Global Security Kit (GSKit) because
   WebSphere Application Server supports the local install of the
   GSKit instead of a global install. The attribute value is set
   to a fully qualified path to the plugin install root.
   
   Supported names recognized by the transport are keyring,
   stashfile, and password. By default, this property is set to
   none.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the current
   documentation before you read this text. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   and select the version and product that is appropriate for
   your WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the August
   2009 update to the Information Centers.
