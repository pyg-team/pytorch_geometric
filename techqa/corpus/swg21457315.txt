PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Warehouse Proxy Agent fails to export historical data when configured to export to data warehouse using MS SQL database. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Increase debug level for Warehouse Proxy Agent to capture exports attempt using (UNIT:khdx ALL). 

Recreate the problem and review Warehouse Proxy Agent logs for the errors:
+4CCECE1D.0001 ERROR MESSAGE: "[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Incorrect syntax near '%'."
(4CCECE1D.0002-E14:khdxdaex.cpp,622,"processExport") Error 219 happened in endProcessSample for originnode Primary:windowshostname:NT and object NT_Logical_Disk (table WTLOGCLDSK appl KNT)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Confirm SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR is not enabled. The Warehouse Proxy Agent log file will show a value if this feature is enabled: 

khdxodbc.cpp,809,"getDatabaseInfo") SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR = " "

MSSQL DBA must disable this feature within the MSSQL database or in the ODBC connection used by the Warehouse Proxy Agent to connect to the data warehouse.
