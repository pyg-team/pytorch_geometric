Text:
Security; IBMSecureRandom; RSA key SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Two Security vulnerabilities exist in FileNet Content Manager and IBM Content Foundation. See the individual descriptions for details.


VULNERABILITY DETAILS
VULNERABILITY DETAILS:
CVEID: CVE-2014-0453 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0453]
DESCRIPTION: 
An Exception thrown by the Security component reveals information that an attacker
could use to break RSA keys via a Bleichenbacher attack.
The fix removes the sensitive information from the Exception message.

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92490 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92490] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-0878 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0878]
DESCRIPTION: 
A flaw exists in the seeding mechanism for the IBMSecureRandom implementation of the IBMJCE and IBMSecureRandom cryptographic providers. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to predict the output of the random number generator under certain circumstances.
The IBMSecureRandom implementation in the FIPS 140-2 IBMJCEFIPS cryptographic provider is not vulnerable. The alternative secure random number generators in the IBMJCE, IBMJCEFIPS and IBMSecureRandom cryptographic providers are also not vulnerable.

CVSS Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91084 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91084] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
