APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The action-wcm-clear-cache-all ConfigEngine task (which will
   clear all the internal WCM dynamic cache instances) will only
   clear entries from the relevant cache when executed on the
   primary node of a cluster.
   
   
   On secondary nodes, a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message is reported but
   the cache instances are not actually cleared.
   
   
   This task (along with all separate task to clear each WCM cache
   instance individually) should be updated to work correctly on
   any node members of the cluster.
   
   
   Disclaimer: When the task is executed on any given node member,
   the cache entries across all node members will be also cleared
   (as cache invalidations are replicated by default).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the required task on the primary node instead.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The action-wcm-clear-cache-all ConfigEngine task (which will
   
   clear all the internal WCM dynamic cache instances) will only
   
   clear entries from the relevant cache when executed on the
   
   primary node of a cluster.
   
   
   
   On secondary nodes, a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message is reported but
   
   the cache instances are not actually cleared.
   
   
   
   This task (along with all separate task to clear each WCM cache
   instance individually) should be updated to work correctly on
   
   any node members of the cluster.
   
   
   
   Disclaimer: When the task is executed on any given node member,
   the cache entries across all node members will be also cleared
   
   (as cache invalidations are replicated by default).
