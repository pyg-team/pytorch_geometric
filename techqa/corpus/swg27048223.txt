 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this document is to provide the step-by-step details for connecting a WebSphere MQ V7.5 queue manager in one platform (Windows) to a V8.0 queue manager running on another platform (Linux), using SSL TLS self-signed certificates.

For illustration purposes the following protocol will be used, which is valid in MQ V7.5 and V8.0:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

Note for MQ V9.0:
The commands mentioned in this tutorial were also verified in a MQ V9.0 test queue manager.

+++ Summary of steps: Sender in Windows connecting to a Receiver in Linux 

Step 1: Client (Windows): Create SSL client key database 
Step 2: Client (Windows): Create certificate
Step 3: Client (Windows): Extract the public SSL client certificate 
Step 4: Client (Windows): Copy Windows certificate to the SSL server side in Linux

Step 5: Server (Linux): Create SSL server key database
Step 6: Server (Linux): Create certificate
Step 7: Server (Linux): Extract the public SSL server certificate and copy it to the SSL client side 
Step 8: Server (Linux): Copy Linux certificate to the SSL client side in Windows

Step 9: Server (Linux): Add the Windows certificate to Linux key database
Step 10: Server (Linux): Run MQSC commands for SSL server side queue manager

Step 11: Client (Windows): Add the Linux certificate to the Windows key database
Step 12: Client (Windows): Run MQSC commands for SSL client side queue manager
Step 13: Test of sending message from Client (Windows) to Server (Linux)

+ Update on August-2016
An appendix was added to include a brief description of using the IBM Key Management GUI (iKeyman) for the corresponding runmqakm commands.
