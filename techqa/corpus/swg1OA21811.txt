ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TEC Level 3 has re-written the TBSM sample rules for the TEC
   Server to resolve your issue with the failure to close ITM
   events when TEC events are closed by TBSM.
   
   They have forwarded the rules changes to TBSM Level 3 and
   requested that they create an APAR and incorporate their
   changes into the TBSM product for distribution with that
   product.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TBSM 3.1 users.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In an environment that has ITM 6, TEC,  *
   *                      and TBSM, and ITM event is received by  *
   *                      TEC and forwarded to TBSM. An           *
   *                      operator in TBSM then takes ownership   *
   *                      of the event and then later closes the  *
   *                                                              *
   *                      event. The ACK and CLOSE are sent from  *
   *                                                              *
   *                      TBSM to TEC, and the event in TEC is    *
   *                      updated correctly, but the status       *
   *                      update is not sent back to ITM, so      *
   *                      the event is never closed in ITM.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When this code was written, ITM did not exist, and therefore
   the code was working properly for the environment and product
   set available at that time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The TEC status rls for status updates from TBSM and the sample
   ihstttec rls will be updated.
