Title: IBM TIP 2.2.0.15 install failure on the TIPCorePostConfig step "Result: 23" - United States

TIPL2; 22015; 2.2.0.15; Result: 23; retrieveSigners; propagateTIPRoles; fixpackPatch; deployOSLC; fixDEPermission TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 One of the TIPCorePostConfig sub-steps in the Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.15 fix pack failed with a: "Result: 23" response. 

CAUSE
This is a result of a WAS defect that is introduced by the WAS upgrade to 7.0.0.35. The APAR is PI25716. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
It assumed this technical note was found because the TIP 2.2.0.15 installation log showed an error the "Result: 23" in a TIPCorePostConfig step. Execute the <TIP Home>/bin/versionInfo command to confirm the WAS level is 7.0.0.35. If the fix pack is at 7.0.0.35, the issue is most like the result of the WAS defect.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To address it you'll need to apply the corresponding WAS iFix (APAR PI25716) manually, and then retry the TIP 2.2.0.15 install.
