PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I clear out the Atlas staging tables? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The "cleanest" way of removing entries from the Atlas staging tables is to let Atlas do the deleting for you. Here are the steps to do this - 
a) go to Admin > Components > DATA_PURGE_SETTINGS 
b) Modify the values for ORGUNIT_STAGING and PERSON_STAGING to a really small window (for example, 1) and save. This is to delete all rows older than 1 day. 
c) go to Admin > Timer Tasks > TempTableCleanup Task > Execute Now 

You can alternatively use the Oracle command "TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>" to remove all rows. However, keep in mind that 
(1) this will immediately delete all rows and there is no "rollback" after you do this 
(2) the next HR loader run will be a "full load" so it will take a while to complete.
