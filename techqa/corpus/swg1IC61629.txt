APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When installing TPC/TIP 4.1 on different Windows drive than
   TPC-R, installation appeared successful (no error posted in the
   installation gui, but TPC-R install log contains errors).
   
   However, when go into TPC gui -> Replication Manager, there is
   nothing shown in the context invocation panel that would allow
   user to go directly into sub-panels of TPC-R gui.
   
   Talked to TPC-R development and found there is already a CMVC
   35130 written for this problem but the fix has not been released
   yet.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is a work around documented in CMVC 35130:
   > Assuming TPC/TIP is on E drive and TPC-R on C drive
   > Run cmd: "E:\Program Files\IBM\Tivoli\tip\bin\wsadmin.bat"
   -lang jython -conntype NONE -f "C:/Program
   Files/IBM/replication/Scripts/CSM_TIP_Install.py" "E://Program
   Files//IBM//Tivoli//tip/systemApps/isclite.ear"
   > Restart TIP server to make change effective
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When Tivoli Storage Productivity Center for Replication is
   installed on a different Windows drive than the Tivoli
   Integrated Portal (TIP) is installed on, the Replication
   Manager context menu does not display in the Tivoli Storage
   Productivity Center GUI. The Tivoli Storage Productivy Center
   for Replication install logs will indicate that there was a
   problem installing files into the Tivoli Integrated Portal
   installation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be provided in the Tivoli Storage
   Productivity Center 4.1.0.2 fixpack that will check for the
   different drives between the two products and use the correct
   location of the Tivoli Integrated Portal installation.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  For the scenario in which the Tivoli Integrated Portal is
   installed on the Windows E: drive and Tivoli Storage
   Productivity Center for Replication is installed on the Windows
   C: drive run the following command (substitute the correct
   drives and locations for your specific instance):
   
   "E:\Program Files\IBM\Tivoli\tip\bin\wsadmin.bat" -lang jython
   -conntype NONE -f "C:/Program
   Files/IBM/replication/Scripts/CSM_TIP_Install.py" "E:/Program
   Files/IBM/Tivoli/tip/systemApps/isclite.ear"
   
   After the command is run, the Tivoli Integrated Portal will need
   to be restarted.
