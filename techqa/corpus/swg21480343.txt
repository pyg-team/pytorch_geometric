Title: IBM Do not have a License Authorisation Wizard - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How can I enter/renew my license? The instructions say to run the License Authorisation Wizard but I cannot find it under the Start menu. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The License Authorisation Wizard is not installed if you choose 'network' at installation.

Please confirm what type of license you have.

If you have a single/site license, reinstall SPSS and select single/site. The License Authorisation Wizard will then also be installed.

If you have a network license, you need to enter/renew the Sentinel License Manager on the server machine
