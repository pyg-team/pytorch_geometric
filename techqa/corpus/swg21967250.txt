Title: IBM Custodian appeared on Who Is On Hold Report but not on My Holds list. - United States

Text:
atlas recipients other person who is on hold WIOH TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to reconcile the Atlas Who Is On Hold Report against the custodian's My Holds list show inconsistencies. 

SYMPTOM
People who show up on the Who Is On Hold Report do not show up the matching custodian's My Holds list.


CAUSE
Custodians that are added to a hold using the Other Person tab instead of the Employee tab are created as records outside of the Person system. As such, even if the name or email address matches a Person record, it is not associated with that login and will not appear on the My Holds list for that Person.

ENVIRONMENT
This happens in any Atlas environment.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Steps to Reproduce:




 1. Open a Hold Notice and select the Recipients for the notice. 
 2. Click on the Other Person tab. 
 3. Enter the name and email address for the custodian and add them to the recipient list. 
 4. Once the notice has been sent, verify that they appear on the Who Is On Hold Report, but not on the Person's My Holds list.
    
    


Diagnosing the problem: 
Identify the problematic custodian record and the corresponding Request ID and Notice ID. Review this custodian's record in the SCOPETARGET table. If the SCOPETARGET.OTHERPERSONID record has a value, then the record has been added via the Other Person tab, and is not associated with the Person record.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problematic custodian needs to be removed from the hold notice recipient list, and replaced with the correct record using the Employee tab.
