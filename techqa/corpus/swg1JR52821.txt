   after Integration Designer restarts.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   Integration Designer
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete process applications and toolkits from the workspace and
   restart integration Designer. After you re-import projects from
   Process Center, open the Process Center perspective before you
   shut down Integration Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Integration Designer might show that logging in to
   Process Center fails even though the correct credentials were
   used. on some systems when process apps or toolkits are in the
   workspace and the workbench is started in the Business
   Integration view. This problem occurs because cookies are not
   being sent back to the server when the Process Center URL is
   called.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for v8.5.5 and v8.5.6 IBM Integration
   Designer that correctly sets the cookies needed for
   authentication.
