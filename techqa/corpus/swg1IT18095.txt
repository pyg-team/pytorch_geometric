APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere MQ V-6.0 on HP OpenVMS platforms using
   HP SSL V1.4-XXX and above could be vulnerable to attack
   on older block cipher algorithms (DES). OpenSSL could
   allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information,
   caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit
   block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol.
   By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between
   the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker
   able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit
   this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain
   sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the
   SWEET32 Birthday attack.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM WebSphere MQ V-6.0 on HP OpenVMS
   platforms using HP SSL V1.4-XXX and
   above could be vulnerable to attack
   on older block cipher algorithms (DES).
   OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker
   to obtain sensitive information,
   caused by an error in the in
   theTriple-DES on 64-bit block cipher,
   used as a part of the SSL/TLS
   protocol.By capturing large amounts of
   encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS
   server and the client, a remote attacker
   able to conduct a man-in-the-middle
   attack could exploit this vulnerability
   to recover the plaintext data and obtain
   sensitive information. This vulnerability
   is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM WebSphere MQ Fix Packs releases
   on HP OpenVMS platforms including
   WMQ-V6.0.2.13 using HP SSL V1.4-XXX and
   HPE SSL1 version prior to 1.0.2i
   are affected.

   .
   Solution: -
   The corrections are made to the existing
   MQ SSL Libraries
   Fix has the following pre-requisites.
   1.fix pack  level WMQ-V6.0.2.13  for Alpha
   2.fix pack  level WMQ-V6.0.2.13  for
   Itanium
   .
   With this fix applied, by default,
   DES based ciphers and the previously known
   vulnerable ciphers will be blocked, thus
   allowing only AES based TLS ciphers by
   default .The code '3DES' indicate cipher
   suites that use triple DES encryption and
   hence they are also disabled for security.
   .
   (With the APAR fix applied)
   .
   Supported Cipher Specs enabled by
   default for both client and servers:
   .
   In case of (HPE SSL version 1.4XXX)
   .
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   .
   In case of HPE SSL1 1.0.2X
   .
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   .
   To enable the ciphers which are not part
   of the default list, the environment
   variable (named AMQ_SSL_CIPHER_LIST) is
   introduced. The usage of the environment
   variable is described in detail in
   README.TXT file bundled with fix binaries.
   .
   For example:
   .
   To enable TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US cipher and to
   enable SSLv3 protocol, define the logical
   as below:
   .
   $ define /system AMQ_SSL_CIPHER_LIST
   "DES-CBC3-SHA"
   and configure the channel cipher spec
   attribute with the value
   "TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US.
   .
   The below set of logicals has been
   removed, as a part of this APAR fix,
   to simplify the user administration
   on enabling and disabling weak
   ciphers and protocols :
   .
   AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE  (APAR IT05182 )
   AMQ_SSL_RC4_CIPHERS_ENABLE(APAR IT08302)
   AMQ_SSL_RSA_EXPORT_ENABLE(APAR  IT07850)
