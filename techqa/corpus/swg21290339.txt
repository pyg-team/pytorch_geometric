PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A WebSphere MQ Javaâ„¢ or Java Message Service (JMS) application is failing, and you need to collect MustGather data to find a solution. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions apply only to WebSphere MQ V6.0 on HP OpenVMS. Refer to the IBM MQ Read First page for instructions on other operating systems:



 * IBM MQ Read First [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618885]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please answer these questions about the problem and then follow the steps below:



 * What Java or JMS problem did you observe on the system?
 * What time did the Java or JMS problem start and when did it stop?
 * Were any Java exceptions reported, and did they include a Java call stack?
 * Which queue managers, channels, queues and topics does the Java or JMS application use?



STEP 1: GENERATE DATA

It is essential to gather information from the system when the Java or JMS problem is happening in order to identify the cause:



 1. 
 2. Generate an MQ classes for Java trace or a Java Message Service trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21174924], depending on whether your application uses the MQ Java or JMS interface.
 3. 
 4. 
 5. Generate a trace of the queue manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667361] at the same time. If the MQ Java or JMS application is connecting to a queue manager on another platform, follow the appropriate instructions below:
    
     * Linux and UNIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665357]
     * Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666876]
     * IBM i [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664990]
    
     * z/OS CHIN trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665093]
     * z/VSE [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666814]
     * HP NonStop Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667375]

STEP 2: COLLECT DATA
 1.  
 2.  Record the MQ version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621707].
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  Record the operating system version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634678].
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  Record the list of processes running on the system:
 9.   
     DISPLAYING PROCESSES
     
     $ SHOW PROCESS /ALL 
     
 10. 
 11. 
 12. If the problem is with a JMS application which uses JMS connection factory and destination objects stored in JNDI [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21161085], display the attributes of those objects. For example, if you configure your JMS objects using the JMSAdmin tool, display them as shown. If any command gives an error, carry on with the others:
 13.  
     DISPLAY CTX 
     DISPLAY CF(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY QCF(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY TCF(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY Q(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY T(*) ALL 
     
 14. 
 15. 
 16. Use runmqsc to display information about the queue manager, its queues, and for Java and JMS client applications, the SVRCONN channel which the application uses when it runs. If any command gives an error, carry on with the others:
 17.  
     DISPLAY QMGR ALL 
     DISPLAY QLOCAL(* ) ALL 
     DISPLAY QALIAS(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY QREMOTE(* ) ALL 
     DISPLAY CHANNEL( *) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) ALL 
     
 18. 
 19. 
 20. Provide the CLASSPATH which your Java or JMS application is using when it runs.
     
 21. 
 22. 
 23. Manually package your files for IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21671892], including files containing the output from the commands listed in Step 1 and 2.
 24. 



STEP 3: SEND DATA TO IBM
 1.  
 2.  Send your data to the IBM ECuRep repository [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/send.html] by email to websphere_support@ecurep.ibm.com, or by standard or secure HTTP or FTP.
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  While the data is transferring, send an email or use the IBM Service Request tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to update your PMR with your description of the problem and of the data you are sending.
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Please do not send data without providing a description!
 9.  
 10. Contact your country representative [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/] if you need to speak to an IBM technical support representative, or in the US call 1-800-IBM-SERV. Refer to the IBM Software Support Handbook [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/handbook/home.html] for more information on working with IBM.
