APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Configuration:
   -------------
   Environment = Microsoft Windows (R)
   Tool = IBM Rational System Architect (R)
   Version = 11.4.2
   
   Description:
   -----------
   Attempts to BPMN export results in incorrectly formed XML for
   Annotation text in IBM Rational System Architect (SA).
   
   This issue affects graphical comments when the data is imported
   into other tools for example IBM Business Process Manager (R)
   8.0.1.
   
   Additional Information:
   ----------------------
   This was decided to be a defect in Escalation RATLC02768435
   TLOG#74087.
   The symbols we found there that are affected are process,
   gateway, sequence flow. But this would be the same for all
   symbols.
   
   This issue was reported with SA version 11.4.2 but is also
   reproducible with SA version 11.4.2.4.
   
   If you do the manual workaround the bmpn import back to SA is
   ok. You may have to set the Display mode again to see the
   graphic comment.
   
   Expected Results:
   ----------------
   In the OMG document: 'Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0'
   (http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/11-01-03.pdf) on page 72
   and 73 one can see that text Annotation should be:
   ?bpmn:textAnnotation id='_445_text'?
     ?bpmn:text?
        SOME TEXT
     ?/bpmn:text?
   ?/bpmn:textAnnotation?
   
   Actual Result:
   -------------
   ?bpmn:textAnnotation id='_445_text'?
     ?bpmn:text?
       ?name?SOME TEXT?/name?
     ?/bpmn:text?
   ?/bpmn:textAnnotation?
   
   Impact:
   ------
   After BPMN Import into other tools the graphical comments are
   not shown.
   
   Repeatable:
   ----------
   Yes.
   
   See attachments:
   ----------------
   * Picture of diagram in SA (screenshot).
   * XML export of diagram from SA (in case you need it to create
   diagram).
   * BPNM Export zip of this diagram (this is where the issue is).
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   ------------------
   1) Create a 'Business Process' diagram with symbols as follows:
      'Process' - 'Message Flow' - 'Gateway' - 'Message flow' -
   'Process'
   2) Enter a 'Graphic Comment' in the 'Symbol' chapter of each
   symbol.
   3) Ensure for each symbol you have a graphic comment as follows:
       i) Right click on the symbol.
       ii) Select 'Display Mode'.
       iii) Find the 'Graphic Comment' Field.
       iv) Enter some text.
   4) Save the Diagram.
   5) Close the Diagram.
   6) Right click on the diagrams name in the Explorer pane.
   7) Select Export BPMN File.
   8) Enter a name for the BPMN zip.
   9) Press Next.
   10) Press OK twice.
   11) Either:
       a) Import the BPMN zip into another tool such as IBM
   Business Process
           Manager (R) 8.0.1 and notice the Graphical Comments are
   missing.
       OR,
       b) Open the BPMN XML file in a text editor and notice the
   syntax in the file.
   
   Workaround:
   ----------
   Edit the BPMN XML file contained the the BPMN zip to the correct
   syntax before importing into other tools.
