PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides instructions on how to bring your ANSI® C++ code into Rational Rose® 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Below are the steps that walk you through a reverse engineer of ANSI C++

1. Make sure your language is set to ANSI
a. Go to Tools / Options
b. Select the Notation Tab
c. Set the default language to ANSI C++ and click OK 
2. Create an ANSI component
a. Right click on the Component View
b. Select New / Component
c. Name the component 
3. Assign the ANSI C++ files to the ANSI C++ component
a. Right click on the component
b. Select ANSI C++ / Open ANSI C++ Specification
c. On the files tab click on the … to browse to the directory that your code is 
in
d. Click OK on the Select Directory screen once your directory appears there
e. Click on the Add Files button
f. Browse to the location of the files that you want to reverse engineer.
g. Now you can click on the OK button and reverse engineer the files.
4. Reverse engineer your ANSI C++ code
a. Right click on the component
b. Select ANSI / Reverse engineer
c. The Reverse engineer screen will come up with the file name in Blue letting 
you know that it is going to add it to the model. 
d. Click the OK button and this will reverse engineer the code
5. Now If you look under the Logical View / C++ Reverse engineer package you 
will see your class or classes appear.
