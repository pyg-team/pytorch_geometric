APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If there are a lot of event jobs in the system, the Process
   Admin Event Manager Monitor page might slow down to the extent
   that you have to wait several minutes for the page to load.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Process Admin Console "Event Manager > Monitor" page is very
   slow.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   If there are a lot of event jobs in the system, the Process
   Admin Console "Event Manager > Monitor" page might slow down to
   the extent that the user has to wait several minutes for the
   page to load.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Instead of showing all event jobs on the Process Admin Console
   "Event Manager > Monitor" page, it is possible to define a
   threshold in the 100Custom.xml file to reduce the number of
   shown event jobs.
   If a threshold is defined, there is a button to retrieve all
   event jobs as needed. If no valid threshold is defined, all
   event jobs are shown.
   Example for an event job threshold definition for the Process
   Admin Console in the 100Custom.xml file:
   
   <server>
    <process-admin-console merge="mergeChildren">
     <event-job-threshold>100</event-job-threshold>
    </process-admin-console>
   </server>
