Title: IBM pound sign (#) in them instead of numbers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When viewing an Impromptu report in PDF format, some columns (eg. a totals column) have the pound sign in them instead of numbers.

For example:

####### instead of 1983684 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Open the Impromptu report. 
2. Right click over your data in the column and click on Properties. 
3. Go to the Size tab. Change the size of the column to be "dynamic" for the height, and "scan the rows..." for the width.

If the problem persists:

-If only some of the fields in the column have the pound sign, increase the number of rows to scan (default 20) in the "scan the rows..." option
-If the entire column is filled with pound symbols, try changing the font to a more 'standard' type. (Eg. if the current font is Courier New, try Times New Roman - Courier New is a fixed width font which may not be rendering properly in PDF. Other problems can occur with special case fonts such as MS Sans Serif which is a non-printing font in older versions of Windows)
