QUESTION
 Customer would like to implement security in their Connect:Enterprise for z/OS. 

ANSWER
How to Set Up Security for C:E for z/OS

You set up CEZ security to not allowing ANY
USERID access and then granting access as needed.

You begin with the following definition in the ODF:

MBXSECURE=ALL or WARN – This will set the security for C:E globally.
(Recommend that you initially set this to WARN until you determine if
you have the correct settings for your users.)

You can then override this global setting with the following ODF parameters:

APISECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for APPC LU6.2 connections only.
BSCSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for bisync connections only.
CSCSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for Cross System Client (CSC) APPC LU6.2 connections only.
FTPSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for FTP connections only.
ICOSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for InterConnect (ICO) APPC LU6.2 connections only.
SNASECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for SNA connections only.
STLSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for STOUTL offline utility functions only.
UIFSECURE - Activates the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for z/OS security
interface for the CICS and ISPF User Interface APPC LU6.2 connections
only.

Values set for use in this explanation:

mbxhlq = USER1 (MBXHLQ=MAILBOX | xxxxxxxx specified in the
ODF)


mbxname = MBX1 (MBXNAME=MAILBOX | xxxxxxxx specified in the
ODF)


All RACF security calls begin with mbxhlq.mbxname (ex. USER1.MBX1)

Top level RACF Generic Dataset Profile which will prevent ANY USERID
(except for USER1 (value of MBXHLQ in the ODF)) from accessing the CE
mailbox from anywhere (Batch, IUI, etc).
This profile may be created with the WARN option to temporarily grant
access while implementing security if using MBXSECURE=ALL. This can be
used to see what RACF access calls are being made.


INFORMATION FOR DATASET USER1.MBX1.** (G)

LEVEL OWNER UNIVERSAL ACCESS WARNING ERASE
----- -------- ---------------- ------- -----
00 USER1 NONE NO NO



ICH408I USER(USER2 ) GROUP(TECHSERV) NAME(JOHN SMITH )
USER1.MBX1.APPC.C$U15 CL(DATASET ) VOL(*BLANK)
WARNING: INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY - TEMPORARY ACCESS ALLOWED
FROM USER1.MBX1.** (G)
ACCESS INTENT(UPDATE ) ACCESS ALLOWED(NONE )


If you want to give any USERID full access to do anything in the CE
mailbox then just give that USERID UPDATE authority to that
USER1.MBX1.** generic RACF profile.


If you want to give USERID USER2 authority to only ADD a batch using
STOUTL then you would create another RACF Generic Dataset Profile like:

1. USER1.MBX1.OFFLINE.ADD.** (this will only allow
USER2 to add a batch with any ID)

or

2. USER1.MBX1.OFFLINE.ADD.USER2* (this will only allow USER2 to add
a batch that has an ID starting with 'USER2'.)



To allow USER2 to all STOUTL functions for batches with ID of USER2
then you could create a Generic Dataset profile and give USER2 UPDATE
authority.


USER1.MBX1.OFFLINE.**.USER2*

You have to create a resource for each user that you want to provide
authority to or restrict for each function that you want that user to
have or not have. In other words if you want a user to have all of the
available functions then you will need to create a resource for each of
the following. That would about 15 entries.

ONLINE Resource Names (remote ID auth.)
mbxhlq.mbxname.ONLINE.$$ADD.mbxid (STOR/STOU)
mbxhlq.mbxname.ONLINE.$$NOADD.mbxid mbxhlq.mbxname.ONLINE.$$REQ.mbxid
(RETR)
mbxhlq.mbxname.ONLINE.$$DEL.mbxid (DELE)
mbxhlq.mbxname.ONLINE.$$DIR.mbxid (LIST/NLST)
(FTP commands are mapped to a corresponding
$$ command equivalent – e.g. RETR  $$REQ)

OFFLINE Resource Names (userid ID auth.)
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.ADD.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.DELETE.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.ERASE.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.EXTRACT.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.LIST.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.MOVE.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.STATFLG.mbxid
mbxhlq.mbxname.OFFLINE.PURGE (no mbxid)

APPC Resource Names (userid ID auth.)
mbxhlq.mbxname.APPC.C$xxx
mbxhlq.mbxname.APPC.C$xxx
mbxhlq.mbxname.APPC.C$xxx
mbxhlq.mbxname.APPC.C$U22.mbxid (browse)
mbxhlq.mbxname.APPC.C$U31.mbxid (browse)
(where xxx = IPS request code)
(mbxid is appended only to C$U22 and C$U31)



The C$xxx values refer to IPS Trailers which are documented in the
Application Agents and User Exits Guide.

You cannot restrict any user from a panel, you can only restrict the
user by the function that you allow or disallow that could be performed
from that particular panel.

IBM security application RACF is the security application that support
is the most familiar with. You would do something very similar to this
in ACF-2 or TSS.
