   ****************************************************************
   When Business Process Choreographer Explorer, which is
   installed and running on support cluster, tries to show the
   details of a BPEL instance, it needs the definitions of the
   interfaces, such as WSDL and XSD files, defined for the
   process. Such definitions are installed with the application
   on the application cluster. Therefore, Business Process
   Choreographer Explorer must depend on the Remote Artifact
   Loader (RAL) to query the URLs for the definitions on the
   application cluster and load the resource by the URLs.
   However, when the following non-default option were enabled in
   administrative console
   Global security > Web security > General settings >
   Authenticate when any URI is accessed
   the Business Process Choreographer Explorer cannot load the
   resources by using the URLs without authentication.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM on Cloud that provide the
   authentication information for Business Process Choreographer
   Explorer to load the resource by using URLs when  &#243;&#212;&#233;&#188; &#244;Authenti
   when any URI is accessed &#243;&#212;&#233;&#188;  &#162; is enabled.
