PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When WebSphere Integration Developer is installed on Linux by an administrator and used by a non-administrator, out-of-date Eclipse configuration metadata is left behind in your /home/<username>/.eclipse directory, possibly preventing the currently installed packages from functioning properly. 

SYMPTOM
WebSphere Integration Developer does not start correctly for non-administrators, or it takes an abnormal amount of time (possibly 10 minutes) to start. The log file in your .eclipse/com.ibm.websphere.integration.developer directory, for example 

/home/<username>/.eclipse/com.ibm.websphere.integration.developer_6.2.0/configuration/1225137678916.log

might contain an entry that is similar to the following entry: 

!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform: 

!STACK 

java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the .eclipse/com.ibm.websphere.integration.developer_6.2.0 directory, for example 

rm -rf /home/<username>/.eclipse/com.ibm.websphere.integration.developer_6.2.0 

Then relaunch the workspace.
