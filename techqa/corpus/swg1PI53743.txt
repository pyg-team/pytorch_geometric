APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You use the CPSM Web User Interface transaction COVC to export
   and then import USER entries from one WUI Server to another WUI
   Server. These records are stored in the EYUWUI dataset.
   .
   If a user had 'Favorites' saved which had blank titles, when
   that user tries to use the WUI where the entries were imported,
   and they click on the 'Favorites' link to expand their list of
   favorites, the Navigation frame on the left side of the WUI
   will produce an error with message EYUVH0500E. The WUI Server
   will write exception trace entries to the AUX trace dataset
   that look similar to the following:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICSPlex SM V5R2M0 Users.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Within the WUI User editor, you are     *
   *                      able to create a favorite link for a    *
   *                      specific user without a valid title or  *
   *                      destination.  This can cause the        *
   *                      following error when the favorites      *
   *                      twistie is expanded for the user:       *
   *                                                              *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all affected WUI regions must be       *
   *                 recycled to pick up the new code.            *
   *                                                              *
   *                 Note that the PTF that resolves this APAR    *
   *                 will stop new invalid favorites from being   *
   *                 created, but will not delete existing        *
   *                 invalid favorites.  If a user receives the   *
   *                 EYUVH0500E error message, the following      *
   *                 steps can be taken to resolve the error:     *
   *                                                              *
   *                 1.  In the navigation section of the WUI     *

   *                        if they are not specified.            *
   *                                                              *
   *                     -  You can hyperlink on "Delete" to      *

   *                        user.  This will take you to the      *
   *                        "Select Favorite to Delete" view      *
   *                        (screen 196), where you can select a  *

   *                                                              *
   *                 6.  After editing or deleting, the user      *
   *                     editor session must be terminated and    *
   *                     the affected user should logoff from the *
   *                     WUI and logon again.                     *
   *                                                              *

   *                     save your changes back to the "User      *
   *                     Editor Selection" view (screen 176).  At *
   *                     this time you can hyperlink on "Close    *
   *                     window" in the user editor navigation    *
   *                     panel to close the user editor window.   *
   *                                                              *
   *                 Note 1:  The EYUVH0500E error can occur even *
   *                          if a title is present but the       *
   *                          destination is not specified. If    *
   *                          the EYUVH0500E error still occurs   *
   *                          then it will be necessary to use    *
   *                          the "Edit" path in step 5 to ensure *
   *                          all existing favorites also have a  *
   *                          specified destination.              *
   *                                                              *
   *                 Note 2:  If the corrupted favorites for a    *
   *                          user had previously been exported   *
   *                          for back up purposes, then after    *
   *                          using the above process to correct  *
   *                          the user's favorites, the export    *
   *                          should be performed again,          *
   *                          replacing the corrupted version.    *
   ****************************************************************
   At WUI View Editor screen 19, a new favorite link could be saved
   by clicking the Finish button. Method EYU0VE13 (VE13) is called
   to process the saving logic. However, due to missing validation
   checks, a favorite link could be saved to the Web User Interface
   server repository (EYUWREP) without a valid title or
   destination.
   
   When expanding the favorite node in the WUI, CPSM retrieves user
   related data from EYUWREP, and shows in the WUI navigation view.
   If a favorite link without a valid destination is entered then
   CPSM fails to process it and message EYUVH0500E is issued.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module EYU0VE13 has been updated to validate a new or modified
   favorite link, to ensure the content identifies a title and
   destination before saving it to the EYUWREP.
