APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ Virtual System Pattern Type FixPack V8.0.0.6 cannot be
   uploaded to IBM Pure Application System because  it has
    a file extension of ".tag.gz" but the PureApp upload
    dialog only allows files of type ".tgz" to be uploaded.
   
   Also, the MQ Virtual System Pattern Type documentation
   does not accurately describe how to install a FixPack.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Rename the file '8.0.0.6-IBM-MQ-PURELinuxX64.tar.gz'  to
   '8.0.0.6-IBM-MQ-PURELinuxX64.tgz' before attempting to upload to
   an IBM Pure Application System.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the MQ Virtual System Pattern Type
   V8.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The MQ Virtual System Pattern Type FixPack V8.0.0.6 on Fix
   Central was named incorrectly with a ".tar.gz" suffix which
   prevented it from being uploaded to the IBM Pure Application
   System (which only allows Pattern Types with a ".tgz" suffix to
   be uploaded).
   
   In addition the installation instructions did not accurately
   describe the differences between installing a MQ Virtual System
   Pattern Type image downloaded from Fix Central and a MQ Virtual
   System Pattern Type image downloaded from Passport Advantage.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ Virtual System Pattern Type FixPack V8.0.0.6 image (and
   later FixPacks ) have been renamed with a ".tgz" suffix so that
   they can be uploaded to an IBM Pure Application System.
   
   and the documentation has been updated so that the installation
   instructions describe the differences between installing a MQ
   Virtual System Pattern Type image downloaded from Fix Central
   and a MQ Virtual System Pattern Type image downloaded from
   Passport Advantage.
