 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is an information disclosure due to an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability when using the OpenSAML features in WebSphere Application Server Liberty. There is an information disclosure vulnerability and a denial of service vulnerability that affect the IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2013-6440 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6440]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSAML could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when parsing XML entities. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted XML document containing external entity references, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/89714 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/89714]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 
CVEID:CVE-2017-9798 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9798]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a flaw in the HTTP OPTIONS method, aka Optionsbleed. By sending an OPTIONS HTTP request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132159 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132159]for the current score

DESCRIPTION: Apache Portable Runtime Utility (APR-util)is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by failing to validate the integrity of SDBM database files used by apr_sdbm*() functions. By making a specially-crafted program or process, a local authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134048 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134048]for the current score
