APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The request with the chunked transfer encoding should end
   with CRLF after the last-chunk (RFC 2616). If the last CRLF is
   delayed and arrives at the Application Server while it is
   sending the response back to the client, the TCP session will be
   disconnected and the client cannot receive all responses.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the request with non-chunked transfer encoding at the client
   side. The HTTP transport policy "Enable chunked transfer
   encoding" sets to false if the client is a Web Service Requester
   on WebSphere Application Server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM WebSphere Application Server Version    *
   *                  7.0, 8.0, and 8.5.5 users                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For chunked encoded requests, if data   *
   *                      is sent after the end of body           *
   *                      sequence 'CRLF 0 CRLF' is read, the     *
   *                      connection is closed immediately with   *
   *                      an RST packet.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   According to section 3.6.1 of the HTTP 1.1 specifications
   document, RFC-2616, "chunked encoding is ended by any chunk
   whose size is zero, followed by the trailer, which is
   terminated by an empty line". The RFC also specifies that
   the trailer is optional. That is, the end of message is
   considered to be the end of body, denoted by 'CRLF 0 CRLF'
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer (whose end is denoted by
   'CRLF'). However, if the end of body was reached and no further
   data had been provided at the moment, the HTTP Channel would
   begin servicing the response. This causes problems if
   additional data arrives for this same connection. In
   persistent connections, the additional data would be
   wrongfully recognized as another request; whereas in
   non-persistent connections, the transmission would be abruptly
   terminated with an RST packet if the peer had not finished
   reading by this time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The HTTP Channel code was modified to wait for the end of
   message before declaring that the request has been fully read.
   To enable this behavior, a new custom property was added to
   the HTTP Channel. The property name is 'WaitForEndOfMessage'
   with possible values of 'true|false' (default:false).
   
   An HTTP Channel custom property can be set like this:
