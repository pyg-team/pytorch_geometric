QUESTION

CAUSE
Heap size not big enough.

ANSWER
For outofmemory (out of memory) conditions, first thing to check is the heap size. Review the following link for recommended settings:

It is recommended to set initialHeapSize to 4096 and maximumHeapSize to 6144. You should set this from the WAS Admin Console following these steps:

- Logon to WAS Admin Console using your wasadmin id and pw. 
- Go to Application Servers
- Select MXServer
- Click on Java and Process Management
- Click on Process Definition
- Click on Java Virtual Machine

The values of interest are: "Initial Heap Size" and "Maximum Heap Size". If out of memory continues even after these changes are made, we will need to review the problem further via PMR.
