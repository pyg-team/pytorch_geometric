APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem is that if no SOAP Header information is passed in
   the SOA requests, then ICI is by default assuming that Blowfish
   encryption is being used on the username and password.  This
   assumption is wrong, and needs to be corrected.  If encryption
   isn't directly specified, then it shouldn't be assumed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Specify no password encryption in the SOAP header:
   
   <soapenv:Header>
   <Encryption>
   <PasswordEncryptionType>None</PasswordEncryptionType>
   </Encryption>
   </soapenv:Header>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Prior to this fix, SOA Web services: 1) automatically defaulted
   to Blowfish encryption if the SOAP header did not specify an
   encryption typeWeb  and 2) failed if a request did not contain
   any SOAP header.  The expected behavior is: if the SOA request
   contains no SOAP header, or if the SOAP header specifies an
   encryption type of ?None? or any  encryption type other than
   Blowfish, then the request succeeds and transmits the password
   as unencrypted text.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To fix this problem, apply IBM Content Integrator V8.5.1 Fix
   Pack 2 or later versions.
