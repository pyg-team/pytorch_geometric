About Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 Annoucement: 
Java SE 6 end of service in WebSphere Application Server V8.5. See details. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/covr_javase6_eos.html] 
Java SE 8 is the recommended Java SDK because it provides the latest features and security updates. 

A fix pack contains bundled service to bring your WebSphere Application Server installation up to a new product level. Installing Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 with IBM Installation Manager raises the fix level of your product to version 8.5.5.13. 

Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 for WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.5 can be installed using the live service repository that contains the fix pack. Use Installation Manager on your local system to update WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.5 with the fix pack from the live web-based service repositories. To install Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 using the web-based ("live") repository provided by IBM, follow the installation instructions in the Steps for installing Fix Pack 8.5.5.13 section. 

No separate download is required for IBM WebSphere SDK, Java Technology Edition, V6 for the full profile. This SDK is embedded in the Application Server and Supplements ZIP files, which are available for download from the Fix Pack Version 8.5.5.13 download page [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044479].

Known issues There is a behavior change in java.util.zip.ZipFile.getEntry() from IBM SDK V8 SR4 FP10. With this release, the name of the ZipEntry instance returned from java.util.zip.ZipFile.getEntry() always ends with / for any zip directory entry. To revert to the previous behavior, set the system property jdk.util.zip.ensureTrailingSlash to "false". See here [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u144-relnotes-3838694.html?printOnly=1] for details.
