ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Managing Server is restarted, Data Collector reconnects to

   Server.
   
   When the Publish Server is down, the Data Collector sometimes
   does not  detect absence of Publish Server connection.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  ITCAM Managing server users who change the
   * request data sampling percentage from the default value of
   * 2%.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * When the ITCAM Data collector reconnects to the Managing
   * server's Publish server component, the sampling percentage
   * is reset to default 2% from the value that was set initially.
   *
   * The DC to Publish server reconnect can happen through the
   * following cases:
   *
   * 1. Publish server is restarted
   * 2. Socket disconnect due to network problems
   * 3. Setting the networkagent.socket.resettime property
   *
