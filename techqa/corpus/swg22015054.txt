QUESTION
 How do I to collect debug and audit log files to provide for SKLM support? 

ANSWER

1. Stop Websphere Application Server (WAS) 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

This will prompt for your username (wasadmin) and password 


2. Remove or move old debug logs 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

Either delete them or move them out of the way - we want the smallest debug 
log as possible since it can grow very quickly. 


3. Set debug=all in SKLMConfig.properties 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

If there is already a line in the file that starts with debug= then you can edit that line. Otherwise, add the following line:  * 



4. Backup or delete the sklm_audit.log file. 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

Move or rename the file to keep it. 


5. Start WAS. 


6. Recreate the error being debugged. 


7. Stop WAS. This will stop the debug log from growing. 


8. Change the line debug=all in SKLMConfig.properties to debug=none and restart WAS. 


Collect the SKLM the debug and audit logs.
