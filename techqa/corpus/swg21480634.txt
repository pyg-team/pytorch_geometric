Title: IBM Can Amos run Monte Carlo with missing data? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I tried to run both a bootstrap and Monte Carlo simulation to arrive at standard errors for my total effects but Amos tells me that it cannot perform a bootstrap with missing values. However, from the Amos help file regarding the Monte Carlo Method, it seems that this bootstrap method should work. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The parametric bootstrap is also unavailable with missing data. AMOS does not have a method, such as listwise or pairwise deletion, to calculate the observed covariance matrix in the presence of missing data. You could calculate and save such a covariance matrix in SPSS and enter that matrix as input data to AMOS. The apparent tradeoff here is that you would be giving up the advantages of the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) approach to missing data (over listwise or pairwise deletion) to obtain the bootstrap confidence intervals (CI)s.

If you have the Missing Value Analysis (MVA) module for SPSS, you can use the EM algorithm in MVA to print a covariance matrix that is less biased than listwise or pairwise deletion would provide. Using the OMS command in SPSS, this matrix could be saved to an SPSS data (.sav) file. SPSS commands could then be used to edit the file to a structure that would be readable in AMOS.
