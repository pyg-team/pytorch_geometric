PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Component Manager Status Monitor for IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (ECM SM) 5.2 returns an error indicating "Server not configured for P8 System". 

CAUSE
The cause is unknown at this time and is not reproducible.

ENVIRONMENT
Other environments may be affected, these are the components seen at this time:


 * ECM SM 5.2.0.X 
 * P8 5.2 
 * AIX

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Error reported as: Server not configured for P8 System 

On the ECM SM 5.2 Server, go to the folder <ECM SM Installation Path>/repos/config/PAM directory.
Examine the fnet50_env.xml and fnet40_sys_env.sh files to see if entries contain "PE_" 

Other Monitors may be failing like the Component Status Monitor, and Component Manager Queue Statistic Monitor.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following procedures: 

 1. On the ECM SM server, go to the <ECM SM Installation Path>/repos/config/PAM directory. 
 2. Make a backup of the fnet50_env.xml and fnet40_sys_env.sh files. 
 3. Open both files for edit. Replace all occurrences of "PE_" with "FNET40_". 
 4. Go to the ECM SM web console and launch the Cala Core Client Installer. Open the FileNet 4.x/5.x configuration and verify that the configuration (notably, the Component Manager tab). 
 5. If everything looks OK in the configuration, click OK, then click Save Configuration, and then install the client again. Leave the three check boxes enabled as they are presented by default on the Core Client Installer. Only attempt to push over the configuration. 
 6. Cala will restart and then all the monitors will run again. The monitor configuration must have System, Product Name, and Server values that match up with what is defined in the configuration. The monitor should now be running as expected.
