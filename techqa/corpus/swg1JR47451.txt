ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you start a coach in Process Designer by selecting the
   coach and clicking "Run Service", a document attachment in the
   coach is not displayed correctly, even though in Process
   Portal, selecting the process and clicking "Run Process"
   results in the document attachment being correctly displayed.
   
   If the prefix of the web page URL from the page displayed by
   "Run Service" in Process Designer is changed from "http" to
   "https", and the port displayed in the URL when Process Portal
   displays the coach is appended to the hostname in the URL
   shown in Process Designer, the document attachment is
   correctly displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1.  From the BPM WAS Admin Console - Select  Applications /
       Application Types / Websphere enterprise applications
   2.  Select IBM BPM Portal <node name> <server name>  and click
       export to create the associated ear file
   3.  Extract the process-portal-support.war  from the ear file
   4.  Within the war file is the directory WEB-INF
   5.  Within this directory is the file web.xml
   6.  web.xml has a line -
       <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
   7.  Change this line to -
       <transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>
   8.  Save the changed web.xml back into WEB-INF in the war file
   9.  Select IBM BPM Portal <node name> <server name> in the Admin
       Console (per step 2)
   10. Select Manage Modules.
   11. Select Process Portal Support and click update.
   12. Take the default options, and when complete, save the
       change.
   13. Stop and restart the BPM server.

   ****************************************************************
   The transport-guarantee property in the web.xml file of the
   process-portal-support.war file in the IBM_BPM_Portal
   application is set to CONFIDENTIAL (allow https transport
   only), instead of NONE (allow http or https transport).
   The circumvention described in the Circumvention section can be
   applied as a workaround.
   This issue will be resolved in a future maintenance release of
   Business Process Manager Version 8.0.1.
