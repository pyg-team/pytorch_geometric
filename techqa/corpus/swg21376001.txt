PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve a problem with IBM Rational ClearQuest Web Java, where a newly added repository connection does not appear in the login screen. 

SYMPTOM
You create a new schema repository and database, or make a connection to an existing one, on the ClearQuest Web server. The server processes should recycle the list of available connections every 10 minutes. However, after time, you still do not see the repository in the list on the ClearQuest Web login screen.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These steps might help in resolving this issue. 

 * Restart the Web services on the machine to force a refresh. Specifically, these services control the database connections, depending on product version.  * 2003.06.13 through 2003.06.16: Rational ClearQuest Request Manager 
    * 7.0.x: IBM Rational ClearQuest Registry Server
   
   

 * Check this registry key: HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Rational Software\ClearQuest\<version>\Core\Databases 
   
   ... where version is either 2003.06.00 or 7.0.0. See if there is a key for the newly added databases. If not, login as a Windows administrator to remove and re-add the repository in the Maintenance Tool of the Web server. 
   
    
   
   
 * Check the previously mentioned ClearQuest Web services to see if they are running as Local System. If so, try changing it to run as a domain or computer user. Then login to the Web server as that same user, and add your connections to the Maintenance Tool.
