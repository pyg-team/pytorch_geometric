Title: IBM Memory corruption (and unpredictable results) using low values of StreamMaxMemLimit - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using a low value for StreamMaxMemLimit in the dtx.ini file could result in memory corruption leading to a map failure, possibly manifesting as an input validation error ('One or more inputs was invalid') for valid data. 

SYMPTOM
'One or more inputs was invalid' error message for a single iteration of a map called from a RUN() function thousands of times. The failure occurs at the exact same point every time for the same input data.


CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR PI88154

ENVIRONMENT
ITX 9.0.0.2 on any valid execution platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
An analysis of backup files taken from the input card of the map called via the RUN() function (create on error) shows a corruption of the incoming data stream.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As a workaround, you can use higher values of StreamMaxMemLimit, but for long term, you should obtain and apply the fix for APAR PI88154.
