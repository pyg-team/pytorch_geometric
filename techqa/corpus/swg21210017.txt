Title: IBM Specifying Different Time Zones in a Citrix Metaframe Environment - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
User is running their Notes Client on a Citrix ICA client Metaframe Terminal Server. User would like to see their time zone when creating a new memo, and not the Terminal Server's time zone. When the user attempts changing the OS time via their Location Document settings, "Use Operating System's time zone settings" under the Advanced tab, the New Memo's time will change after a period of inactivity.

ANSWER
Changing the Location Document setting, "Use Operating System's time zone" settings to not use the operating system time, will change the Local OS time to the chosen time zone. In a Citrix environment, the Notes client is installed and run on the Terminal Server. If the user does not have administrative access to the Terminal Server, the OS time will not change. However, strange behavior has been found when modifying this setting in a Citrix environment. One instance was reported where the PostedDate field (or DisplayDate), will change back to the Terminal Server time after a period of inactivity. 

The DisplayDate, which is a formula that looks for the PostedDate field in the Document Properties or the Creation Date and Time, is the time and date displayed in a New Memo (reference TN 1086189). The PostedDate time is taken from the Operating System's time. 


Citrix Administrators can create a Citrix based policy to indicate whether or not the users' ICA clients will follow their local OS time or the Citrix time zone. Please refer to Citrix technical support for more information. 

For Calendaring and Scheduling issues, please refer to SPR TDON66CQVX. This SPR provides a work around for users who are accessing the Notes Client in a Citrix environment and are in a different time zone than the server.
