ABSTRACT
 Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) Applications built using IBM® Rational® Application Developer v7.0 fail when run using EJBDeploy from IBM WebSphere® Application Server v5.1 or v6.0. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
PK57362 resolves the following problem:

ERROR DESCRIPTION: 
WebSphere Application Server (base) 5.1.1.3 
Rational Software Architect 7.0.0.4 

Projects are migrated from RSA6 to RSA7 but still use WebSphere Application Server 5.1 as the runtime. Projects that are already migrated to RSA6/7 cannot be built with the ejbcompiler toolkit from the standalone WebSphere Application Server v5.1. 

If there is a migrated backend folder(produced by RSA7), it is not possible to do ejbdeploy using ejbdeploy script which is bundled in standalone WebSphere Application Server v5.1. 

The error that occurs will be similar to the following:

[wsejbdeploy] framework search path: c:/<Programe files><IBM><WAS-V51>/deploytool/itp/plugins 
[wsejbdeploy] java.lang.NullPointerException 
[wsejbdeploy] at com.ibm.etools.ejbrdbmapping.migration.

PROBLEM SUMMARY:

USERS AFFECTED:
All users of WebSphere Application Server v5.1 and v6.0 EJBDeploy

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
EJB Applications built using Rational Application Developer v7.0 fail when run using EJBDeploy from WebSphere Application Server v5.1 or v6.0.

RECOMMENDATION:
None

APAR PK57362 is being closed FIN with concurrence from the submitting customer. This means that a fix to this APAR is expected to be delivered from IBM in a release which is being developed at the time that the APAR was closed. The latest release of the product to exit development at the time this APAR was closed was: WebSphere Application Server 6.0

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 

In Rational Application Developer V7.0 a new SQL model format was introduced to resolve many design problems with the SQL model format used by WebSphere Studio Application Developer V5.1.x Rational Application Developer V6.0. 

The EJBDeploy command tool for WebSphere Application Server v5.1 originated from the EJBDeploy GUI tool for WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1 and the EJBDeploy command tool for WebSphere Application Server v6.0 originated from the EJBDeploy GUI tool for Rational Application Developer v6.0. As a result, they will not understand the new SQL model introduced in Rational Application Developer V7.0. 

Running the EJBDeploy command tool from WebSphere Application Server V5.1 or V6.0 is going to fail to process your EJB application if you use Rational Application Developer v7.0 to develop an EJB that contains a CMP 1.1 or 2.x back-end targeting either a WebSphere Application Server V5.1 or V6.0 

The fix for this problem is an entire replacement of the EJBDeploy command tool for WebSphere Application Server V5.1 and V6.0 with the EJBDeploy provided in WebSphere Application Server V6.1. 

 

The problem introduced in Rational Application Developer V7.0 that causes this scenario to fail has been corrected in Rational Application Developer V7.5. A new action has been added to the EJB Project context menu which will allow generating a CMP backend folder that is compatible with the WebSphere Application Server V6.0 EJBDeploy command tool. 

In Rational Application Developer V7.5 this action can be found by selecting Java™ EE > EJB to RDB Mapping (1.x-2.x) > Generate back-end files for WebSphere Application Server 6.0 deployment. 

 

CAUTION 

 * This update replaces the entire deploytool directory so you should never apply it to a production environment or to any product other than WebSphere Application Server. This EJBDeploy update cannot be used with Wsadmin or Administrative Console tools. You can only use the updated EJBDeploy through the command-line scripts (ejbdeploy.bat or ejbdeploy.sh) or the WsEjbDeploy Ant task 
 * Ensure that the original EJBDeploy deploytool directory and wsanttasks.jar file are backed up (for more details see the Installation Instructions section) before applying this maintenance 
 * See the Known side effects section under the Download package section for WebSphere Application Server maintenance information

PREREQUISITES
WebSphere Application Server V5.1.x or V6.0.x installed on the supported Operating System platforms.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Please review the readme.txt for detailed installation instructions.

If, after applying this solution, any additional WebSphere Application Server fixpack maintenance is needed using the Update Installer then you must restore the original deploytool directory and wsanttasks.jar file for a successful update. After the new maintenance is applied you can apply the EJBDeploy V6.1 for WebSphere Application Server V5.1 or V6.0 maintenance by following these instructions in this download again.
