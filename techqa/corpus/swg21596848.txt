Title: IBM Schema name supplied at design time within Event Designer results in SQL error at execution time - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DataResolver exception in the system log trying to retrieve data from a named schema that is different than the username that created the data connection in the Event Designer. 

SYMPTOM
[3/30/12 8:51:58:158 PDT] 00000038 SystemErr R 
com.ibm.wbe.server.resolver.DataResolverException: BEER2795E: An error 
occurred retrieving data from SQL: com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.io: DB2 SQL Error:
SQLCODE=-204, SQLSTATE=42704, SQLERRMC=SCHEMANAME, DRIVER=3.57.82 


CAUSE
The event runtime can only access the tables in the schema named after 
the username specified for use in authenticating the data connection

ENVIRONMENT
Database independent.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Behavior of naming schemas' default vs non default.


If you set a default schema: 
1- Event Designer only shows the tables in that schema 
2- the runtime can only access the tables in the schema named after 
the username of the data connection 
If you don't set a default schema: 
1- Event Designer shows all the tables regardless of which schema they 
belong to 
2- the runtime can still only access the tables in the schema named 
after the username of the data connection
