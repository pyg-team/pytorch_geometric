   ****************************************************************
   NetView for z/OS Enterprise Management Agent application support
   resource jar files do not have the required MANIFEST.MF
   statement "permissions:all-permissions". The browser's applet or
   java web start access to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal will be
   blocked if the browser's java is Oracle v7 update 51 (u51). No
   other levels or versions of java running in the browser will
   have this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Enterprise Management Agent workstation application support
   and language pack support resource jars are being rebuilt to
   include the new permissions statement in the manifest file. For
   6.2, the fix is included in the package identified as level
   6.2.0.1 (6.2 fixpack 1). Defects 180488 and 180488.1 contain the
   change. For 6.1, the fix is included in the package identified
   as level 6.1.0.2 (6.1 fixpack 2). Defect 180489 contains the
   change.
   
   Fixes for 6.1 and 6.2 will be available for download from Fix
   Central by 7 March 2014 and will be listed in technote
   #1660437 at:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660437 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660437]
   
   For 6.2 a PTF for the NetView for z/OS Enterprise Management
   Agent will need to be applied on the host along with the 6.2
   fixpack 1 application support files. This PTF will also be
   listed in technote #1660437. The PTF updates files for the
   self-describing agent function that reside on the host.
