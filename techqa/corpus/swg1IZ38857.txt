PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  It is currently not possible on Windows (x86 & X64) to have more
   than 2.048 different zip files concurrently open. This is a
   limitation built into the C library file handling.
   ZIP_Open (ZIP_Generic_Open) call JVM_Open which calls hpi::open
   and hpi::open mapped to C library function open. On Windows,
   there is a limitation of 2048 open file handle in the
   implementation of MSVCRT. Now java.io uses  native Windows API
   on windows to resolve this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR10
   .
   Port SUNBUG - 6423026.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20090305 or later
