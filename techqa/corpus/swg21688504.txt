REMEDIATION/FIXES
For all versions of Content Navigator, we recommend that customers not enable SSLv3 in their environments. This technote describes how to ensure it is disabled in WebSphere Application Server: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173].



For ICN 2.0.3, if you have enabled SSL on your IBM Content Navigator end user help system as per the Planning, installing and configuring IBM Content Navigator > Completing post configuration tasks documentation, http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucde090.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucde090.htm], you will need to disable SSLv3. 

The end user help system will be using SSL_TLS by default if SSL is enabled, which is both TLS and SSLv3 enabled.

Disable SSLv3 by specifying sslProtocol="TLS"

<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLS" />

See http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173] for more information. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.
