PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You create a System Event using the CICS Explorer and export the bundle file to your z/OS HFS UNIXÂ® File System. During CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 startup your bundle install fails with messages DFHEC1003 reason BAD_XML_DATA and DFHRL0102E reason CALL_BACK_ERROR. 

SYMPTOM
You see the following messages in CICS job log (MSGUSR):

DFHRL0107 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhrl/RL0107I.html] I The CICS resource life-cycle manager has started to create the BUNDLE resource bundlename.

DFHEC1003 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhec/EC1003.html] The CICS event capture component failed to create the EVENTBINDING resource name.evbind reason BAD_XML_DATA.

DFHRL0102 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhrl/RL0102E.html] E The CICS resource life-cycle manager failed to create the resource name.evbind and returned with reason CALL_BACK_ERROR.


CAUSE
You have created a System Event [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.eventprocessing.doc/concepts/dfhep_systemevents.html] using the CICS Explorer version 1.1.x and you are trying to install the Event Bundle in CICS TS 4.1. CICS System Events is a new feature for CICS TS 4.2 and is not compatible with CICS TS 4.1. In this case, the example CICS FILE ENABLE STATUS event was used. Since this is a System Event, it can not be used with CICS TS V4.1.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Either upgrade to CICS TS V4.2 to use CICS System Event functions within the CICS Explorer version 1.1.x or do not create a System Event if you plan to install the bundle in a CICS TS V4.1 region.

There are several examples shipped with the CICS Explorer V1.1.x in the Explorer > New Wizards > Other > Examples folder that are System Events. Do not use these examples if you plan to use your bundle with CICS TS V4.1: 

 * CICS DB2 CONNECTION STATUS event 
 * CICS FILE ENABLE STATUS event 
 * CICS FILE OPEN STATUS event 
 * CICS TASK THRESHOLD event 
 * CICS TRANCLASS TASK THRESHOLD event 
 * CICS Unhandled TRANSACTION ABEND event


The CICS TS V4.2 information center lists the System Events [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.eventprocessing.doc/concepts/dfhep_systemevents.html] that are supported in V4.2:  * FILE enable or disable status 
 * FILE open or close status 
 * DB2CONN connection status 
 * TASK threshold 
 * TRANCLASS TASK threshold 
 * Unhandled transaction abend


A request for enhancement [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/] (RFE) (number 16580) has been submitted for review by CICS Development to request that only functions for CICS TS V4.1 are available, without the CICS Explorer version 1.1.x System Event functions, if using CICS TS V4.1.
