PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You connected to your CICS Transaction Server region by using a web browser and the 3270 Bridge facility. You enter a transaction, and receive message:

DFHSN1212 Signoff at netname xxxx has failed because the terminal has preset security. 

CAUSE
An application program has issued a command that is not permitted when using the 3270 Bridge.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not run transactions that issue commands that are not permitted when using the 3270 Bridge. 

The 3270 Bridge provides an interface so that you can run 3270-based CICS transactions without a 3270 terminal. Your user transaction is unchanged, but because of the way it now runs in the bridge environment, there are some restrictions on what it can do. 

One of the restrictions is that your program can not issue EXEC CICS SIGNON or EXEC CICS SIGNOFF commands. This is because a 3270 Bridge facility terminal has preset security. See section Link3270 programming considerations [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfhtm/topics/dfhtm27.html] in the CICS TS information center for programming restrictions when running transactions under the 3270 Bridge.
