PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 For IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances, a match rule does not work as expected when using an asterisk (*) such as a wildcard or "match all" value in a rule. For Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) in the field description, a match all is in the PCRE format of ".*". 

CAUSE
Matching rules used to select messages for processing by a given Processing Rule may use PCRE expressions for matching, or may use URL wildcard matching expressions. If you are intending a "match all" value in your rule and the match is not working as you expect, check to see which matching method is in use.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As of version 3.5 of the firmware, the main page of the Match Action object configuration allows the user to specify which matching method is used in matching rules. By default, this is not PCRE. 

On many of the other screens presented in the WebGUI, look for the "PCRE" in the field description or in the on-line help. 

PCRE, Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, is the same regular-expression syntax used in W3C XML Schema. If PCRE is in the field description, then to match "anything" use the two-character sequence period-asterisk: ".*". In ".*", the period indicates any character and asterisk indicates any character can appear 0 to an infinite number of times. 

If PCRE is not specified in the field description, use only the asterisk: "*".

This information applies to the following appliance models:


 * WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50, 
 * WebSphere DataPower XML Security Gateway XS40 
 * WebSphere DataPower XML Accelerator XA35.

Allows the use of an asterisk as a "match all", or wildcard entry.
