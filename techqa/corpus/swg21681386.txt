Title: IBM Prompted reports hang when run in the Cognos Mobile app for iOS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In an environment using an IIS web server configured for Windows Authentication, when a prompted report is run in the Cognos Mobile app it hangs at a white screen and never renders the prompt page. Reports without a prompt page work as expected. If Anonymous Authentication is enabled in IIS, the problem stops. 

CAUSE
There is a known issue with windows authentication on certain versions of iOS (known to affect 7.0.0 through 7.0.3).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade to the latest version of iOS. At the time of this writing, the latest version is 7.1.2 and it was confirmed to work correctly with prompted reports and windows authentication.
