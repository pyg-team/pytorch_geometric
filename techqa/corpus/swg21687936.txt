QUESTION
 How do I use silent configuration to configure the WAS profiles? 

ANSWER
You can configure the WAS profiles using a silent configuration command. 

You have two kinds of WAS profiles: 

* profiles that have one server (usually the default server1) in it 

* profiles that may have more than one server in it. 

You can configure both types of these profiles in silent configuration mode. I've created a wordpad document here which shows both instances of configuring the profiles with one server and profiles that have multiple servers. 

In this technote, detach the attached zip file and unzip it. You will find two silent response files and one wordpad file. Open the wordpad file and follow the steps in it. The wordpad file shows examples of how to configure WAS profiles with one or multiple servers. 

I've also included the silent response files used in my example. 

Note: These tests were run with DC v7.2 IF10 applied on a Win 2008 R2 EE SP1 64-bit system monitoring WAS 8.5.5 profiles. You can use the same information for Unix-based profiles although the paths will change to Unix formats.
