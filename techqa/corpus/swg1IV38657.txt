APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The start of virtual server with
   eezcs -D Domain -c "nodereq -o startwait -t <Timeout value>
   <server name>"
   might crash.
   This is because the implementation queries resource status every
   10 seconds. The query also takes some time. Because of sleep
   time between queries it might be that at the end the timout
   becomes effective, but just when the server completed startup.
   This lead to exception.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   * Tivoli System Automation Application Manager (SA AM) 3.2.2
   * users using the command shell
   ****************************************************************
   * The start of virtual servers with the command
   *  eezcs -D Domain -c "nodereq -o startwait -t <timeout>"
   * does not honor the specified timeout value correctly. The
   * current implementation queries the status and then sleeps for
   * 10 seconds before setting up the next query. For the timeout
   * calculation it uses the 10 seconds, but does not consider the
   * time it takes to run the query command. As a result, the real
   * time, after which the timeout is reached, is higher than the
   * specified value.
   * If the query command takes e.g. 2-3 seconds, the difference
   * between the specified timeout value and the timeout of the
   * command is about 20-30%.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The internal handling of the command 'eezcs' has been adjusted
   to address this issue. Now the specified timeout value is
   honored, however since the status is determined by a query, the
   real time until the timeout might still differ by single digit
   seconds from the specified timeout value.

   The official fix for this problem will be included in fixpack 2
   of Tivoli System Automation Application Manager 3.2.2.
