ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have imported a rule application archive file into the
   toolkit, and as a result, a decision service is created.
   
   You right click the decision service, and select
   Extact XSD Files... The wizard opens, you choose a
   ruleset with XSD files, presses Finish, but no XSD files are
   extracted.

   MalformedUrlException.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Toolkit V9.0 who create a decision
   service file by importing a rule application archive file, and
   then attempt to extract XSD files from the decision service
   where the XSD files have a namespace which does not start with
   http://. [http://.]
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Extracting XML schemas from a decision service (created by
   importing an ODM rule application archive file) where the XML
   schemas have a namespace which lacks a prefix of http:// results
   in java.net.MalformedURLException
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Extracting XML schema files from a decision service (created by
   importing an ODM rule application archive file) now works when
   XML schema namespaces do not start with http:// .
