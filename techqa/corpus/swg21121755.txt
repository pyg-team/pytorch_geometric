QUESTION
 This technote provides you with the steps required to preform a silent installation of the IBM® Rational® products. 

ANSWER
Any previous version of Rational versions products must be completely removed, before installing Rational products.

Make sure the system meets the minimum requirements. Please check the supported Hardware and Software platforms in the Release Notes.

To perform the installation you must: 

 * Have local administrator privileges 
 * Check that no other applications are running 
 * Disable any Anti-virus 
 * Turn off any desktop environments that run on top of Microsoft® Windows®


The silent installation is performed in two steps: 

 1. Create a release area that will contain the defaults files and all the needed information for subsequent silent installation 
 2. Perform silent installations on client machines 


Create a site defaults file and a release area. 

 1. Create a shared directory 
 2. Use the Enterprise Deployment option in the Rational Setup wizard to create 
    a site defaults file 
 3. Enter the required information in each page of the wizard, such as client or 
    server, feature names, installation path, license information, registry 
    information 
 4. In the completion pages, enter the shared directory location and the name for 
    the site defaults file (*.dat)


Perform silent installations on client machines.
The silent installation can be performed on the client machines by running a .bat with the following command: 

 * 
 * setup.exe /g \\Machinename\Shared\sitedefs.dat


Silent Install Options:



Option: Definition: /p "REBOOT=REALLYSUPPRESS" Suppresses the Automatic Reboot after installation /l c:\temp\<LOGNAME>.txt Creates a log file of the installation process 

Performing a silent uninstallation: msiexec.exe /X <path to product>.msi /qn

Note: msiexec.exe is located in the setup folder in the network release area. 

 

Option: Definition: /p REBOOT="ReallySuppress" Suppresses the Automatic Reboot after uninstallation /X Indicates that an uninstall operation is executed. /qn Indicates that no User Interface is displayed during the uninstallation, making it silent.
