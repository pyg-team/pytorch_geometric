Title: IBM Special characters in Domino email might be indexed incorrectly with IBM Content Collector Content Search Services Support - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Domino email documents that contain a MIME body part written in a non-ASCII code page are indexed incorrectly with IBM Content Collector Content Search Services Support V4.0.0.2 and V4.0.0.3. 

CONTENT
Description 

If a Domino email document that contains a MIME body part written in a non-ASCII code page is archived into IBM FileNet P8 and indexed by IBM Content Collector Content Search Services Support V4.0.0.2 or V4.0.0.3, all characters that are not included in the ASCII code page are indexed incorrectly. 

 

Consequences 

The original email including the MIME body part written in a non-ASCII code page is preserved correctly and there is no data loss. 

The only impact arises when searching for these documents. The original email itself can be found by searching for metadata, for example the sender or recipients, or for email body content excluding the non-ASCII content. However, if you search for keywords that contain special characters and occur in the non-ASCII MIME body part only, the email document will not appear in the result list because the non-ASCII MIME body part has not been indexed correctly. 

For example, if the email body is written in French and contains the words "grande nation française," searching for the keywords "grande nation" will yield a result whereas searching for the keyword "française" will not.
