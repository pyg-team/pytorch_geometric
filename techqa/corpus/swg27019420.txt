Database 


FAQ: Does Workflow database support cross platforms?
Answer: Workflow database is required to be on the same type operating system as the Workflow Server.


The database can be on the same machine as the Workflow server or a remote machine.


FAQ: When should Database optimization be done?
Answer: 
Database optimization should always been done after the Workflow Cleanup Server completes. For DB2 this is a RUNSTATS/REBIND.
The files fmcsys.log and fmcerr.log have corresponding database tables fmc.system_log and fmc.error_log.
The Workflow system should be configured through the FDL to remove entries over a set age from the Workflow system and error logs.
In the db2diag.log file large numbers of lock escalations on fmc.system_log and fmc.error_log can be an indication the tables are too large.


FAQ: Does Workflow support Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) connections?
Answer: Workflow simply does not support Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) connections.


FAQ: What needs to be taken into account when using WebSphere MQ Workflow together with DB2 UDB Version 9.5?
Answer: To use DB2 UDB Version 9.5 as the runtime database for WebSphere MQ Workflow, you need 



 1. WebSphere MQ Workflow 3.6 SP7
 2. 
 3. DB2 UDB V9.5 FP 6 or APAR IC62872 (otherwise new server and Buildtime configurations will create databases in Unicode, and Unicode databases are not supported)
 4. 


FAQ: What needs to be considered when the runtime database was created with a DB2 version earlier than V8?
Answer: When the runtime database was created with a DB2 version earlier than V8, there are possibly still type-1 indexes contained in the database. That index type might due to next-key locking situations lead to occurrences of deadlocks that would (because of their improved concurrency) not occur with type-2 indexes.
Please see Converting type-1 indexes to type-2 indexes in migrated databases [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.migration.doc/doc/t0050553.html] for details and instructions.


FAQ: What version of DB2 is bundled with WebSphere MQ Workflow?
Answer: the currently available media pack is on SP9 level and contains DB2 Version 9.1.

Miscellaneous



FAQ: What is the difference between MQ and MQ Workflow?
Answer: MQ Series is a messaging product and often referred to as just 'MQ', while MQSeries Workflow is a workflow management system (that, however, utilizes MQSeries to handle the communication between its components).


FAQ: How do I increase Maximum message length settings in Workflow?
Answer: The parameters MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_SIZE and MAXIMUM_QUERY_MESSAGE_SIZE, defined in the FDL, should be of a large enough value to handle the largest message sent through MQ Series. They should also be synchronized with the MQ Series parameter maxmsgl:


 * MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_SIZE in the FDL 
 * MAXIMUM_QUERY_MESSAGE_SIZE in the FDL 
 * alter qmgr maxmsgl(....) in runmqsc 
 * alter qlocal(EXCINPUTQ) maxmsgl(....) in runmqsc 
 * alter channel(QMGRNAME.CL.TCP) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) maxmsgl(....) in runmqsc 
 * alter channel(QMGRNAME.CL.TCP) CHLTYPE(CLNTCONN) maxmsgl(....) in runmqsc 

FAQ: What are the steps to shut down Workflow?
Answer: The Workflow server must always be completely stopped before MQ Series or the database system. This means all Workflow servers: Admin, Execution, Cleanup, Scheduling.


FAQ: What are the steps to startup Workflow?
Answer: To startup Workflow server, you must always start the database system first, MQ Series second and then all Workflow servers: Admin, Execution, Cleanup, Scheduling.


FAQ: Why does WMQWF client time out after MQ has been upgraded to V7?
Answer: For WebSphere MQ V7, the fix for APAR PM14021 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM14021] needs to be applied.


FAQ: How can Cleanup or Scheduling Server be moved to a different system in the same system group?
Answer: To move Cleanup or Scheduling Server to a different system in a system group, the following FDL needs to be imported into the runtime database:
/* Get rid of the old definition */
DELETE SERVER 'SCHEDSVR.FMCSYS.FMCGRP' TYPE SCHEDULING_SERVER

/* Redefine the server with a new/different RELATED_SYSTEM specified */
SERVER 'SCHEDSVR'
DESCRIPTION "Default scheduling server"
RELATED_GROUP 'FMCGRP'
RELATED_SYSTEM 'FMCSY2'
TYPE SCHEDULING_SERVER
END 'SCHEDSVR'


Please note that 

 1. in the DELETE statement the fully qualified name has to be used 
 2. both steps, DELETE and the corresponding new definition have to be in a single FDL input file and need to be handled in the same import run 
 3. the sample FDL refers to the scheduling server; for cleanup server it needs to be adapted appropriately
