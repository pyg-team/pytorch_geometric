Text:
content security policy; widget; embedded; export TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to display a widget exported from IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) dashboard in an external web page results in error 
"
Refused to display in a frame because an ancestor violates the 

following Content Security Policy directive: frame-ancestors 'self'". 

CAUSE
By default RQM prevents embedding widgets in web pages served from a domain that is different than the RQM domain. This is done for security reasons.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Procedure:


 1. Navigate to RQM Advanced Properties page
    
 2. Locate a section called net.jazz.ajax.service.internal.XFrameOptionsService
    
 3. Set the following two properties in that section to false:

 * Prevent clickjacking (Content-Security-Policy) 
   
 * Prevent clickjacking (X-Frame-Options)
