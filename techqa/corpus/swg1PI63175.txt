APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upgrading to WAS v8.5.5.9 generates this exception:
   
   java.lang.ClassCastException:
   com.ibm.wsdl.extensions.schema.SchemaImpl incompatible with
   javax.wsdl.extensions.UnknownExtensibilityElement
   
   The WebServices application initially runs successfully and
   eventually generates the exception when the web service is
   invoked or the WSDL is retrieved.
   
   This is caused by a regression in the web services component
   introduced in APAR PI53589 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI53589].
