Text:
 NEWS

ABSTRACT
 IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6, Service Refresh 11 general availability. 

CONTENT
Service refresh 11 is now available on developerWorks and contains a number of enhancements to the Java V6 code base: 

 * There are performance improvements to hashing algorithms used for hashed data structures. 
 * You can programatically determine which JVM version your application is running on with a new system property. 
 * The IBM GBK converter can use Unicode 2.0 standards. 
 * There is a change in the default encoding for the AIX ja_JP locale. 
 * There is a new IBM security provider for the United States Department of Defense Common Access Card. 
 * The IBM PKCS#11 security provider supports additional cryptographic adapters. 
 * You can control how some signal handlers end in the z/OS Language Environment. 
 * An error message is generated when there is an OutofMemoryError condition on the Java heap. 
 * New trace points are available to diagnose memory problems associated with the use of DirectByteBuffers.

Visit developerWorks: IBM developer kits [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/index.html] to download the service refresh for your platform. 






Hashing algorithms 

An improved hashing algorithm is available for string keys stored in hashed data structures. You can adjust the threshold that invokes the algorithm with a new system property. Before enabling this property in a production environment you should test your applications thoroughly. 

For more information, see Java Diagnostics Guide: Summary of changes [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/preface/changes_60/changes.html]. 

Determining which JVM version your application is running on 

The system property, java.runtime.version, can be called at runtime to determine the JVM version in use. For more information, see Determining which JVM version your application is running on [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.user.lnx.60/user/java_version_check.html]. 

IBM GBK converter 

By default the IBM GBK converter follows Unicode 3.0 standards. A new system property value is available to force the IBM GBK converter to follow Unicode 2.0 standards. 
To force the IBM GBK converter to follow Unicode 2.0 standards, use: 

-Dfile.encoding=bestfit396 

Default encoding for the AIX ja_JP locale 

The default encoding for the AIXÂ® ja_JP.IBM-eucJP locale is changed from x-IBM33722C to x-IBM29626C. The AIX V7.1 and AIX V6.1 TL 6100-06 releases extend the NEC-selected character support to the IBM-eucJP code set used for the AIX ja_JP locale. From IBM SDK for Java, V6 service refresh 11, converters IBM29626 and IBM29626C are added to support these changes. 

IBM Common Access Card security provider 

The IBM Common Access Card (IBMCAC) provider enables applications to use standard APIs to access the United States Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC). This provider is available only on the Windows platform. 

For more information, see IBM Common Access Card provider [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.security.component.60.doc/security-component/cacDocs/cac_provider.html]. 

IBM PKCS11 supported devices 

The following cryptographic adapters are now supported by the IBM PKCS#11 security provider: 
 * SafeNet Luna 4.0 
 * SafeNet Luna 5.0 
 * Thales nShield Edge 
 * Thales nShield Connect 1500.


These specific models have not been tested by IBM, but support is assumed because other cards in the same family have been tested successfully: 
 * Thales nShield Connect 500 
 * Thales nShield Connect 6000


The SafeNet Luna 3.0 is no longer supported. 

There are a number of observations for these cards, which can be found in the Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.security.component.60.doc/security-component/pkcs11implDocs/cardobservations.html]. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.security.component.doc/security-component/pkcs11implDocs/cardobservations.html] 

JVM signal handlers on z/OS 

JVM signal handlers for SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGTRAP, and for SIGABRT by default terminate the process using exit(). If you are using the IBM z/OS Language Environment (LE), LE is not aware that the JVM ended abnormally. Use the -Xsignal:posixSignalHandler=cooperativeShutdow n option to control how the signal handlers end. For more information, see JVM Command-line options [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/commands_jvm.html]. 

OutofMemoryError conditions 

An error message is now generated when there is an OutofMemoryError condition on the Java heap, as well as the native heap. 

Tracing use of DirectByteBuffers 

You can use new trace points to diagnose memory problems associated with the use of DirectByteBuffers. For more information, see Tracing application use of DirectByteBuffers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/problem_determination/win_mem_trace_dbb.html]
