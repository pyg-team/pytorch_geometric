QUESTION
 Where can I obtain the DB2 Configuration Assistant (CA)? I want to provide a GUI interface for connecting to my DB2 remote servers? 

ANSWER
The DB2Â® Configuration Assistant (CA), formerly known as the Client Configuration Assistant (CCA), is part of the DB2 Administration Client. In DB2 V7 the DB2 CCA was included with the DB2 Run-Time Client, however with DB2 V8 it is now included with the DB2 Administration Client. With DB2 V9.1, V9.5 and V9.7 it is now included with the IBM DB2 Data Server Client.
The DB2 Administration Client and the IBM DB2 Data Server Client are included with all DB2 Server products like DB2 Enterprise Server Edition on Linux, UNIX, and Windows.

The DB2 Configuration Assistant can be opened by issuing the command db2ca from the DB2 Command Window. 

The db2ca utility can be found in the C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB\bin directory, where C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB is the path where DB2 was installed.
