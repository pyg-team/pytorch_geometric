 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 26, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM SDK for Node.js. IBM SDK for Node.js has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID:CVE-2017-3732 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a propagation error in the BN_mod_exp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v4.7.2.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v6.9.4.0 and earlier releases.
The corresponding open-source versions are v4.7.2, v6.9.4 respectively.

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf ssh <appname> -c cat staging_info.yml

Look for the following lines:
{"detected_buildpack":"SDK for Node.js(TM) (ibm-node.js-xxx, buildpack-v3.xxx)","start_command":"./vendor/initial_startup.rb"}

If the Node.js engine version is not at least v4.7.3 or v6.9.5 your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.0.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v6.10.0.0 and subsequent releases.

To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=4.8.0"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=6.10.0"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application using the IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack v3.11.
