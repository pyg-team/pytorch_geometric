PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All ITNM 3.9 Users.                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The issue was that due to a discovery configuration error (  *
   * invalid NAT gateway ) the discovery was doing a full         *
   * discovery every 90 seconds. This resulted in a lot of        *
   * disco.profilingData entries which summarize each of those    *
   * discoveries. The table used to store the profilingData (     *
   * disco.profilingData ) was leaking memory every time data was *
   * retrieved from it. Unfortunately when the discovery status   *
   * GUI is activated it requests all the data from this table    *
   * every 20 seconds.The problem can be easily seen by starting  *
   * up a discovery process with multiple profilingData entries   *
