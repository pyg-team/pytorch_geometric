ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A certificate imported by KeyImport command as (*key type
   (type):private key) should have both public and private key in
   it.  When a tklmKeyList is done on that certificate it currently
   only has a private key associated with it in the database.
   
   This does not cause any functional issues.
   
   CMVC Defect #107108
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem(Abstract)
   Import certificate using tklmKeyImport CLI (*key type
   (type):private key). Listing keys using tklmKeyList CLI shows
   only one Key - the private key.
   
   Symptom
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   i) Login to wsadmin:
   "wsadmin.sh(bat) -username tipadmin -password {tip password}
   -lang jython"
   
   ii) Create a selfsigned certificate cert1 by tklmCertCreate
   command.
   
   iii) Execute tklmKeyList command and observe that two keys are
   listed for the certificate cert1
   
   iv) Export the cert1 certificate by tklmKeyExport command. And
   then delete the cert1.
   
   v) Now import the exported certificate in step (iv) by using
   tklmKeyImport command
   
   vi) Execute tklmKeyList command and observe that there is only
   one key listed for the imported certificate
   
   Resolving the problem
   A certificate imported by tklmKeyImport command as (*key type
   (type):private key) should have both public and private key in
   it. However, tklmKeyList CLI is incorrectly displaying only the
   private key and not the public key. This is just a display error
   and will not affect the functionality of TKLM. Both, public and
   private, keys are indeed imported correctly into TKLM keystore,
   however the CLI displays only the private key. This will be
   fixed in a future TKLM release. At the TKLM v1 level, this
   display error can be ignored.
