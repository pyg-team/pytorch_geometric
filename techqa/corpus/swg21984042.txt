Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I obtain the latest RHEL patches, including security updates, for IBM PureApplication System? 

ANSWER
IBM delivers patches (including security fixes) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata] policy. As stated in the Red Hat policy, fixes are not provided for all vulnerabilities on all RHEL versions; therefore IBM cannot deliver security fixes for some RHEL issues. 

When security and other related updates are available from Red Hat, IBM delivers those updates in fixpacks and interim fixes that can be downloaded and applied to the IBM PureApplication System. IBM delivers emergency fixes that can be applied to deployed IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux virtual machines, or you can use the Red Hat Satellite Service [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCR9A_2.2.0/doc/iwd/apc_redhat_satlitesrv.dita?lang=en] shared service. 

IBM publishes Security Bulletins with additional information for security related updates. Customers should subscribe to My Notifications [https://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/myview/subscription/css.wss/] to be notified of important IBM PureApplication System support alerts.
