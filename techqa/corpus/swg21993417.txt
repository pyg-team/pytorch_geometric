 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM Security Network Protection (XGS) sensor to flow data collector mode? 

ANSWER
About this task
IBM Security Network Protection (XGS) is designed to inspect network traffic and is in inspection mode by default. By adding tuning parameters, you can change the mode from "inspection" to "collector" to increase flow data processing efficiency. 
Note: Changing "inspection" to "collector" mode will mitigate the inspection performance of IBM Security Network Protection (XGS). Despite the mode is changed, the content and the format of flow data stay unchanged, and the level of product integration remains the same.

Procedures 

 1. Perform one of the following tasks:  1. If the sensor is registered to SiteProtector System,  1. Access the SiteProtector System that manages the XGS appliance. 
         2. In Agent view, right click the target XGS appliance. 
         3. Click Manage Policy > Advanced Tuning Parameters.
        
        
     2. If the sensor is not registered with SiteProtector System, access the Local Management Interface (LMI) of IBM Security Network Protection (XGS), and then Click Manage System Settings > Advanced Tuning Parameters.
    
    
 2. Add the following parameters and ensure that value is set to true:
    Name: flowdata.mode.collector
    Value: true 
 3. Save and deploy the policy.
