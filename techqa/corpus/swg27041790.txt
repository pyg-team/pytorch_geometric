ABSTRACT
 When you write a custom plug-in to upload files to IBM Content Navigator and add files to a FileNet P8 repository, be sure to use the correct file input field name in the file input form. 

CONTENT
The file input field must use the correct name, uploadFile, so that your custom plug-in's upload service uploads the correct file. 

If you use a name other than uploadFile, problems occur with subsequent document uploads when a user adds or checks in a file by using IBM Content Navigator. Your custom upload service picks up the previous file that was uploaded by IBM Content Navigator, instead of the current file that you intended to add or check in.

For example, the following file input form code is valid for the upload service because it uses the correct file upload name: 

<form data-dojo-attach-point="_fileInputForm" name="${id}_fileUploadForm" id="${id}_fileUploadForm" enctype="multipart/form-data" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post" target="${id}_fileInputIFrame">
<input type="file" required="true" id="${id}_fileInput" name="uploadFile" class="fileInput" 
data-dojo-attach-point="_fileInput" data-dojo-attach-event="onchange: onFileInputChange" />
<iframe name="${id}_fileInputIFrame" id="${id}_fileInputIFrame" style="display: none"> </iframe>
</form> 

 

Use only uploadFile for the file input field name, and do not create variations such as _uploadFile.
