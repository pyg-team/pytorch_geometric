Title: IBM BigFix Remote Control upgrade fixlet release policy - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why we do not keep the old RC component upgrade fixlet? 

ANSWER
 Due to the security vulnerabilities being reported almost quarterly for some of the components RC uses (OpenSSL, Java), 
we are forced to release fix packs very regularly. We understand our customers cannot update so regularly so we always 
take great care of ensuring we do not break backwards compatibility to support our customers mixed environments.

Since a fix pack can potentially be released just weeks after the previous ones due to the security vulnerabilities severity, 
you would find yourself in a situation when the current released version is no longer matching your production environment anyway.

BigFix offers great flexibility to manage customer specific requirements through the creation of custom fixlets. 
Since every binary we have released is still available. It is possible for you to copy custom fixlets referencing the RC version that makes sense for your environment.
