APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the AccessAdmin you can search for TAM E-SSO users.
   
   When using the wildcard (*), I can see all available users.  But
   when
   we want to search for a specific user, you could search by
   "Enterprise
   user name".  So when I want to search my own account, I type in
   the
   search field:  (AD account ID)
   But when I want to search on e.i.  the Last name of a user, in
   my case then the following message is shown:  No results were
   found matching your search criteria.
   
   
   Also when using a wildcard in the search field when searching
   for Name
   (first last), Last name or E-mail address, the same error
   message is
   shown and no users are shown.
   
   This makes searching for users very difficult.
   I have noticed this issue is IMS 8.1 related for all my
   installed
   environments.  In IMS 8.2 (for other customer), I do not have
   these
   issues.
   
   Administrator guide is straight forward,
   1. Select AccessAdmin  &#65529; Search users.
   2. Enter the subject of your search in the Search for field.
      To find partially matching results, enter characters
      followed by an asterisk (*).
      For example, to find all users whose enterprise user name
      begin with the letter "i", enter i* in the Search for field.
   3. Select a search criteria from the Search by list.
   4. Click Search. The search results are displayed, containing
      all the matches or partial matches.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   
   Desired Behavior: Should be able to search Users
   
   Environment:
   TAM E-SSO v8.1 FP4 installed on Windows 2008 R2
   MS SQL 2008 R2
   IBM WAS 7.0.0.17
   
   RTC 31439
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  User search in AccessAdmin did not return the expected results
   when wildcards ('*') were used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem has been addressed in an IMS 8.1 iFix. The code
   change will be included in future IMS 8.1 fix packs.
