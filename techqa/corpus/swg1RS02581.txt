APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running a Test Suite in Decision Center business Console,
   we can choose to display the "List of Rules Fired".
   The list is display in the report for each scenario.
   However, the order for all the rules in this list looks random.
   With early version (JRules) similar ordering was the same as
   the execution order, which was helpful when checking why a
   specific scenario was not executed the way we expected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The random listing is caused by a communication and
   deserialization issues between the DC back end and front end.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed.
