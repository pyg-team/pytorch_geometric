PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 region abends during startup with message DFHRM0001 or DFHAP0001 due to an abend 0C4 in program SAFRT001. 

SYMPTOM
The messages for this CICS job prior to the abend indicate CA Top Secret initialization was in progress:

TSS6088I - TSS/CICS Core Manager Subtask is Active
TSS6089I - TSS/CICS Program Manager Subtask is Active
DFHAP0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0001.html] An abend (code ---/AKEA [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/AKxx_abend_codes/AKEA.html]) has occurred at offset X'FFFF' in module DFHAPDM.

Instead of the DFHAP0001 message you might see something like:

DFHRM0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhrm/RM0001.html] An abend (code ---/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'01D6' in module DFHRMXN4.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The dump shows that an abend0C4 occurred during an INITIALISE_DOMAIN call to DFHAPDM to initialize the AP domain. The abendS0C4 occurs in CA module SAFRT001 on a MVC instruction (D208 1000 3000) due to the contents of Register 3. Reg3 is pointing to the last 8 bytes of a page. These 8 bytes contain the word SURROGAT:

C3C1D2E2 D7C9D5E3 E2E4D9D9 D6C7C1E3 | CAKSPINTSURROGAT |
35CCE000.:35CCEFFF. LENGTH(X'1000')--Storage not available

The failing instruction is trying to move 9 bytes, and the ninth byte falls into the next page which is not available, causing the abend0C4.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply CA fix CIT8673. Contact [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410576&amp;aid=1]CA [http://www.ca.com/] if you need additional assistance.
