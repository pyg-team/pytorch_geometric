CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566] 

Description: ReqPro could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The RequisiteWeb Server of all versions of IBM Rational RequisitePro are affected.

The LDAP authentication may be affected if it is using SSLv3 to connect to the LDAP Server

REMEDIATION/FIXES
On your RequisiteWeb Server host, configure the IBM HTTP Server to disable SSLv3.

Follow the instructions in the following bulletin: 
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687172]

If you connect directly to SSL-enabled ports served by a WebSphere Server, follow the instructions in the following bulletin to mitigate the problem on your WebSphere server:
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]

If you use integrations with IBM Rational ClearQuest, follow the instructions in the following bulletin for your ClearQuest servers and clients:
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM Rational ClearQuest (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687405]

For LDAP authentication, ReqPro uses the RPSetup LDAP client library and GSKit to make the secure connection with LDAP server. We have enabled the FIPS mode (which disables SSLv3) by default in the fix packs mentioned below. 

This may require some configuration changes on the LDAP server to disable SSLv3 and use other security protocols. 

Secure LDAP authentication for your users will fail after you apply the fix pack if your LDAP server is configured to use SSLv3 only, 

ReqPro can be reverted to the original behavior, allowing LDAP SSLv3 connections, by setting a diagnostic behavior flag. Contact IBM Rational Customer Support for assistance setting this behavior flag, and reference this bulletin. 

 

Affected Versions Workaround/Mitigation 7.1.4.x Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 6 (7.1.4.6) for 7.1.4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038941]
An alternative mitigation is to configure LDAP server to disable SSLv3.
Contact your LDAP administrator for assistance. 7.1.3.x Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 13 (7.1.3.13) for 7.1.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038940]
An alternative mitigation is to configure LDAP server to disable SSLv3.
Contact your LDAP administrator for assistance. 7.1.2.x Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 16 (7.1.2.16) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038939]
An alternative mitigation is to configure LDAP server to disable SSLv3.
Contact your LDAP administrator for assistance. 7.1.1.x Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 16 (7.1.2.16) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038939]
An alternative mitigation is to configure LDAP server to disable SSLv3.
Contact your LDAP administrator for assistance. 
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
