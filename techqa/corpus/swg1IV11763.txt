APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If we create a situation with the following formula:
   *IF *VALUE MS_SQL_Services_Detail.Service_Type *EQ
   Analysis(OLAP)
   Then, the situation will have a Problem Status and we can not
   use it.
   The problem is caused by the parenthesis char used by agent that
    is not supported by TEMS.
   The problem can be solved by replacing
   Analysis(OLAP) with Analysis_OLAP
   in koq.atr and dockodi files provided by MSSQL agent.
