   then crash again.
   
   Customers comments:
   
   I wanted to give you a little more info on what we have done
   with this today. I did a complete uninstall of Notes and then
   re-installed, using version 8.5.3 (previously using 8.5.2). As
   soon as the user attempted to open a Java agent, Domino Designer
   closed down.
   
   I then had one of the other developers try to open the same Java
   element, using the same version of Domino and the same platform
   on the same hardware. It opened instantly without issue. After
   this I pulled another machine and put the users hard drive in
   this other machine and again, Domino crashed as soon as the Java
   element was opened.
   
   The last thing I attempted was upgrading to the newest version
   of Java and this did not help anything.
   
   The machine hasn't had any new software added to it since I
   reloaded it a few weeks ago and it was working for a short
   period of time.
