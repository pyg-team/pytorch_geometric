Rhapsody; Eclipse; BundleException; JDT; JDTPlugin; com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.wfi.jdt.JDTPlugin.start; com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.wfi.jdt; org.osgi.framework.BundleException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open Eclipse with IBM Rational Rhapsody platform integration plugin causes JDT BundleException 

SYMPTOM
Eclipse may hang or crash at various stages during operation. Possibly upon closing the IDE. 

An exception like the following will also be found in the workspace log file:

org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Exception in com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.wfi.jdt.JDTPlugin.start() of bundle com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.wfi.jdt
.


CAUSE
The appropriate language-specific development toolkit is not installed in the Eclipse IDE for the language specified in the Rhapsody project.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the .log file that is found in the .metadata folder of the current workspace. 

For example, C:\eclipse-cpp-mars-2-win32\eclipse\workspace\.metadata\.log


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The IBM Rational Rhapsody platform integration plugin requires that either: 

 * the Eclipse JDT is installed in the Eclipse IDE to use the Java language in a Rhapsody project 
 * the Eclipse CDT is installed in the Eclipse IDE to use the Cpp language in a Rhapsody project
