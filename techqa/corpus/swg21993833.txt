QUESTION
 How can we re-brand the IBM Sterling Secure Proxy Configuration Manager (SSPcm) that allows the use of our company's logo or other special content? 

CAUSE
This would be useful as it makes it easier to distinguish between the differing environments (such as Production or Development) during day to day activities.

ANSWER
Currently there is no built-in option to achieve this. 



As a work-around, the following may be used, at your own risk.

1) Change Wording.

The wording on the SSPDashboard is pulled from variables in the SspGuiMessages.properties


<SSPcm install>/apps/jetty/webservices/webapps/SSPDashboard/WEB-INF/classes/SspGuiMessages.properties


Simply change the “product_orig_full_name” variable as required for each system, for example:
product_orig_full_name=Sterling Secure Proxy – Prod


Restart SSPcm. 



2) Change Colours.

The Colours are all set in the stylesheet.css file in following directory
<SSPcm install>/apps/jetty/webservices/webapps/SSPDashboard/resources
Locate the .headerTitleDiv section and change the color value to red (for example):

.headerTitleDiv {
position:absolute;
left:25px;
top:30px;
color:red;
font-size:28px;
font-weight: bold;
padding:0px;
z-index:5;
}


Restart SSPcm. 



3) Change Background Colors.

The background colors are actually images. If you want to change any of these then create new images and update the stylesheet.css file as required.
Look for references to background-image and point to the new images using valid url’s
background-image: url(bkgd_topmenu_nav.jpg);


Restart SSPcm. 



4) Warning: These changes will be lost each time an upgrade or installation is performed so you will need to persist these outside SSPcm and merge them in each time an upgrade is done. 

Take a back-up before making any changes.
