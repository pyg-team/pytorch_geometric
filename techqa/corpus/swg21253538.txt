PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
You receive message: DFHZC2455 E 016B XXXX In CA mode - Task attached. ((1) Module name: DFHZATT). If you are running CICS V3.1, the terminals that you receive this message for hang. If you are running CICS V2.3, your CICS region abends. You are using GT Software ASSIST/TS.

CAUSE
Vendor product manipulating the TCTTE control block

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You have terminals that are hung, and when you review the message log pertaining to these terminals you find:
DFHZC2455 E YK11 XXXX In CA mode - Task attached. ((1) Module name: DFHZATT)
DFHZC3437 I YK11 CSNE Node yyyyyyyy action taken:CLSDST NEG RESP ABTASK ABSEND ABRECV SIMLOGON ((1) Module name: DFHZNAC)
DFHZC2410 E YK11 ZZZZ Node Unrecoverable. VTAM LOSTERM Error Code X'14' ((4) Module name:DFHZLTX)
DFHZC3424 E YK11 ZZZZ Session failure. Session terminated immediately ((1) Module name:DFHZNSP)
DFHZC3437 I YK11 CSNE Node UG1T0375 action taken: NOCREATE CLSDST ABTASK ABSEND ABRECV SIMLOGON ((1) Module name: DFHZNAC) 


Note, there is no DFHZC3462 session terminated message. The terminal is now hung forever. 
A dump at this time shows that there is a task and TCA associated with this terminal, that is now stuck in a ZCIOWAIT in Dispatcher. Review of internal trace showed program GTAZCIX ran prior to the terminal hang, and appears to be manipulating the TCTTE control block. If you turn off GT/Assist, the problem does not occur. 

If you are running CICS V2.3, you receive message DFHZC2455 E then CICS abends with the following messages. GT/Assist provided the same fix:

DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'0000198C' in module DFHZARQ 
DFHDU0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'0D34' in module DFHTCXDF 
DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'00000216' in module DFHTFP

DFHRM0002 A severe error (code X'020C') has occurred in module DFHRMUW. 

Additional symptoms:

DFHZC2305I Termination of VTAM sessions beginning
