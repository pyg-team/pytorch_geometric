Hardware Requirements Group Applicable Component Notes Components All Applicable Components  WebSphere MQ Telemetry contains the following components:

 *  Server
 *  Daemon
 *  Java Client
 *  C Client
 *  MQ Explorer plug-in

 The Daemon and C client are not restricted to running on the reference platforms; they can also run on any platform where a suitable Linux kernel and libraries are available. The IBM service team may request that a problem be reproduced on a reference platform.

Java Client Java Client  The Java client is not restricted to running on the reference platforms; it can also run on any platform where a suitable Java runtime is available. The IBM service team may request that a problem be reproduced on a reference platform. The client can be run on the following Java runtimes:

 *  JSE 1.4.2 or above that is "Java Compatible".
 *  Java Micro Edition (JME) CLDC 1.1 MIDP 2.0 or later that is Java Powered.
 *  Java Micro Edition (JME) CDC 1.1 Foundation profile 1.1 or later that is Java Powered.
 *  In addition to running in a basic JRE the non-MIDP client is packaged as an OSGi bundle and can be run in an OSGi runtime compliant with the OSGi R4 core framework specification

Processor All Applicable Components  AMD64, EM64T, and compatible processors: any hardware that is explicitly compatible and fully capable of running the specified operating system, all the corresponding supporting software, and any associated applications unmodified.

Daemon and C Client  Linux for ARM processor architecture, with glibc
Hardware: Marvell XScale processor, tested on Eurotech Viper
Software: Linux kernel 2.4.21, glicbc 2.3.3

Daemon and C Client  Linux for ARM processor architecture, with uclibc
Hardware: ARM v5 architecture processor
Software: Linux kernel 2.6.31, uclibc version 0.9.30.1
