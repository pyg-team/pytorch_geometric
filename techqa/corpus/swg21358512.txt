QUESTION
 Clarification of the current $IMPACT_HOME/doc/HOWTO_SecureMode3x.txt documentation, and the required properties to enable Impact connection to ObjectServers that are running with the -secure option. 

CAUSE
Currently confusion exists over the inclusion of legacy information in the documentation and incorrect assumptions are leading to incorrect configurations failing to connect to secure ObjectServers.

ANSWER
The ImpactServer properties: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


are no longer pertinent in Impact 4.x, 5.x, 6.x & 7.x onwards and the documentation in: 

 * 


is misleading. APAR IZ37843 was raised for the documentation to be updated. 

The change was really between Impact 2.x & 3.x in the use of SecurityManager for login authentication. Impact 3.x onwards has authentication=bogus by default, as login authentication went on to be managed by the SecurityManager and then WebSphere VMM and LDAP and SSO and so on. Latterly the process by which the ImpactServer uses the ObjectServer for authentication uses an alternate property file and different properties. 

The properties set that enable connection to a SecureMode ObjectServer, poll for, Get & update events are: 

 * 
 * impact.objectserver.securemode=true 
   impact.objectserver.secureusername=<Username> 
   impact.objectserver.securepassword=<nco_crypt Password> 

 * 
 * impact.<EventReaderName>.objectserver.user=<Username> 
   impact.<EventReaderName>.objectserver.password=<nco_crypt Password> 
   impact.<EventReaderName>.objectserver.securemode=true 


With these alone one will be able to perform all the desired functions against a pair of failover SecureMode ObjectServers. The host & port definitions for the ObjectServer(s) are now those as normally defined in the DataSource used by the EventReader & DataTypes.
