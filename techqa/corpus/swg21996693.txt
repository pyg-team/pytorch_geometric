Title: IBM Blocking HTTPS websites using domain category objects on Security Network Protection sensors - United States

QUESTION
 Can you block HTTPS websites without an Outbound SSL Inspection license on Security Network Protection (XGS) sensors? 

CAUSE
Blocking a website or domain is handled differently than blocking or inspecting a URL on the XGS sensor. URL inspection requires an Outbound SSL license, while blocking a domain does not.

ANSWER
There are two configuration options that can be used to block access to an HTTPS domain: Domain Certificate Category or Domain Certificate List objects. 

Notes: 

 * Users trying to access a website that is blocked by Domain Certificate rules will not see a block page. There is no current way to configure a block page for this type of access. 
 * The configuration options described here use a list or a category of domains. They do not use URL matching. If you want to configure blocking of HTTPS websites based on a complete URL, you must use URL Category or URL List objects with Outbound SSL Inspection.

Domain Certificate Category

This method allows you to block access to all websites in a specific category. 
 1. Find the appropriate category for the URL that you want to block.  1. Go to the X-Force Exchange website [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/] and search for the URL. For example, [https://gmail.com] searching for https://gmail.com/ [https://gmail.com/] shows you:
        
        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=1]
        
     2. Look at Categorization section to identify the categories for the URL.
        
    
    
 2. Open the Network Access Policy for XGS and create a Domain Certificate Category object.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=2]
    
 3. Enter a name for the object in the General Configuration tab and select the category or categories that you identified in step 1 for the Domain Categories tab. Click Save Configuration when you finish creating the object.

    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=4]
    
 4. Create a NAP rule to Reject traffic for the category.

 5. Deploy your changes to the XGS.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=6]
    
 6. Attempt to access the website and confirm that it is blocked.



Domain Certificate List

This method allows you to block access to a specific website. 
 1. Locate the Common Name (CN) for the website's certificate. Using the same https://gmail.com/ [https://gmail.com/] example, you find:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=7]
    
 2. Open the Network Access Policy for XGS and create a Certificate List object.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=8]
    
 3. Enter a name for the object and enter the CN from step 1. Click Save Configuration when you finish creating the object.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=9]
    
 4. Create a NAP rule to Reject traffic for the category.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=10]
    
 5. Deploy your changes to the XGS.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=11] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21996693&aid=11]
    
 6. Try to access the website and confirm it is blocked.
