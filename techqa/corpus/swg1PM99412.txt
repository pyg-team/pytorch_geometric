APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On zOS, customer may notice high CPU usage by IIM searching for
   updates if 'Search for Installation Manager updates' and 'Search
   service repositories during installation and update'  are
   enabled.
   
   The workaround is to turn off both  'Search for Installation
   Manager updates' and 'Search service repositories during
   installation and update' in IIM preferences.

   ****************************************************************
   High CPU usage in IIM on zOS for a total of 8 minutes delay
   in searching for updates, and intermittently seeing times
   when a forked IBM Installation Manager process is staying
   active under the name of the issuing user and draw GCP CPU -
   looping.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In reviewing the log files we could see that the IBM
   Installation Manager was waiting for user input in console
   mode and this accounted for the perceived delay.  We could
   not reproduce the forked process problem.  We are closing
   this issue as 'unable to reproduce'.
