ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   Tried to change a Resources Reference bindings for an installed
   applciation under: Enterprise Applications > APP_NAME > Map
   resource references to resources. If we point to a resource
   which is out of scope, then we are presented the "Application
   Resource Warnings" page with message ADMA8019E: The resources
   that are assigned to the application are beyond the deployment
   target scope...".
   
   From this page we can't move forward; we always receive "HTTP
   404 - File not found /applicationDeploymentDetail" error if we
   select either the Continue or Cancel buttons.
   
   FFDC shows the following Stack Exception:
   
   ---------------------------------------
   key = java.io.FileNotFoundException
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.FilterProxyServlet.dispatch 312
   Exception = java.io.FileNotFoundException

LOCAL FIX
 *  Note: even though an exception is being thrown when the ok or
   cancel is clicked, the data will be saved correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Application Server V6.0.2 users   *
   *                  deploying applications with resources.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During application edit, leaving the    *
   *                      resource warnings panel generates an    *
   *                      HTTP 404 /applicationDeploymentDetail   *
   *                      not found.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  Even though the console cannot navigate     *
   *                  past the resource warnings panel, the data  *
   *                  entered was saved.  You can navigate using  *
   *                  the left navigation pane to get back to     *
   *                  your application detail.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   When editing applications with resources, if the resource
   warnings panel is displayed, you cannot navigate properly by
   pressing Continue or Cancel. When you press Continue or
   Cancel, you see an HTTP 404 message saying
   /applicationDeploymentDetail is not found.  At this point you
   can only navigate through the left navigation pane, but the
   data you just entered was not lost.  The fix for this APAR
   also includes the fix for PK44872 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK44872]. This problem would prevent
   the resource warnings panel from being displayed unless an
   application had been installed during this user's console
   session. PK44872 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK44872] results in a NullPointerException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code was corrected to allow you to navigate without error.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fixpack 6.0.2.33.  Please refer to the Recommended
   Updates page for delivery information:
