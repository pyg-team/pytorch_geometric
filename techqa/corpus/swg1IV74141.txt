APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS the CipherSuite that
   has been specified should determine the selected Security
   Protocol, either SSLv3 or TLSv1 to be used on the Secure Socket
   Connection.
   
   WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS were requesting that the Secure
   Socket use the SSL Security protocol even though a TLS
   CipherSuite had been specified.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To use the TLS protocol when establishing a secure connection to
   a WebSphere MQ queue manager, you must enable FIPS 140-2 (for
   example by setting the sslFipsRequired field in the
   MQEnvironment class to the boolean value "true") and using a
   FIPS 140-2 capable CipherSuite.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS
   and classes for Java who attempt to make a secure connection to
   a WebSphere MQ queue manager using the TLS protocol with the
   following Java CipherSuites:
   
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS and classes for Java were
   determining the secure protocol (SSLv3 or TLSv1) to enable on
   the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket object based on the name of the
   configured Java CipherSuite to use.  This resulted in the
   WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS and classes for Java enabling
   only the SSLv3 secure protocol for the Java Cipher Suites:
   
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ v6 classes for JMS and classes for Java have
   updated to enable the TLSv1 secure protocol when either of the
   following two Java CipherSuites have been specified:
   
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
     - SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
