 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to modify the Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio. The Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio is fix and can not modify manually. 

SYMPTOM
Calculation result from an intersection are not as expected.


CAUSE
How works the Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio: 

When calculations in the rows and columns of a report intersect, Analysis Studio performs the calculations in the following order:


 1. addition or subtraction 
 2. multiplication or division 
 3. aggregation (rollup) 
 4. remaining arithmetic functions: absolute, round, round down, average, minimum, maximum, medium, count 
 5. percentage, % difference (growth) or % of total 
 6. rank, quartile, quantile, or percentile


If both calculations have the same precedence, for example, if they are both business functions, then the row calculation takes precedence. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two ways to modify the Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio. 


1. Open the analysis with Report Studio and change the Solve Order.

2. 'Trick' the Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio. Here is an example:

As seen in the image below, there is the calculation Sum(Product(All)) in the rows and the calculation Abs(Diff(January, January)) in the culumn. The fix Calculation Solve Order in Analysis Studio lead to calculate the intersection (red cell) from this two calculations as the following expression described Abs(Diff(January, January)). This intersection does not show the sum of the above values. The following calculation Abs(Diff(January, January)) have to change into the calculation Sum(Abs(Diff(January, January)),0). This calculation lead to calculate the above values as follow:

Sum(Abs(Diff(January Camping Equipment, January Camping Equipment) + Diff(January Mountaineering Equipment, January Mountaineering Equipment) + Diff(January Personal Accessories, January Personal Accessories) + Diff(January Outdoor Protection, January Outdoor Protection) + Diff(January Golf Equipment, January Golf Equipment)),0)

The result is the sum of the above values because when a calculation in a row and in a column have the same precedence, then the row calculation takes precedence.
