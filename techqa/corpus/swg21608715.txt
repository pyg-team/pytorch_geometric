PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During an operation using sequential media the following error is seen in the Activity Log:
ANR8302E I/O error on drive RMT2 (/dev/tsmscsi/mt2) with volume (OP=READ, Error Number=0, CC=205, rc = 23, KEY= FF, ASC=FF, ASCQ= FF, SENSE=**NONE**,


CAUSE
This problem occurred as a file/handle needed to be opened but the nofiles/open files ulimit had been reached.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The message indicates this occurred during a read operation (OP=READ), the CC=205 means "SCSI adapter failure", the ASC/ASCQ of FF/FF have no meaning. The key to this problem is the rc=23 which means either "Too many open files in the system" or "File Table Overflow". 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem get the current ulimit -a and check for the nofiles(open files). Increase the ulimit -n. 


Example: 

to set the nofiles/open files ulimit to 4096 issue: ulimit -n 4096.
