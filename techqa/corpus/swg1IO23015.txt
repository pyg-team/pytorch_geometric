APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Content Navigator's Configuration and Deployment tool may fail
   during the Update the FileNet P8 Client Connector Files step on
   if the application server in use has SSLv3 disabled. SSLv3 is
   not to be used as following the POODLE attacks, has been deemed
   not secure. It was disabled for use in Websphere with
   8.0.0.0-WS-WASJavaSDK-WinX64-IFPI27100
   
   The error thrown is:
   "Unable to initialize SSL
   connection.  Unauthorized access was denied or security
   settings have expired.  Exception is
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol
   SSLv3 not enabled or not supported".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Adding the generic JVM argument
   "-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3=false" re-enables SSLv3, allowing
   the step to complete, but this is not secure.
