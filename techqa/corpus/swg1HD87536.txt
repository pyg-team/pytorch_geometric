   NOTE FROM LAURA STOWERS OF DS on 7/20/2009:  As an FYI since
   Marisela is out this week. We both were able to reproduce the
   problem in SR00019962 (which was also noted in SR00018114.
   Per this note, since L2 is aware of the issue and has
   reproduced it, I did not attempt to reproduce this issue at
   the Front End as I have no Boeing customized environment
   available in which to do so.
   Note from FE:  There are 2 attachments with the same file size
   and date (time is within 3 minutes) but I am sending both to
   the back end to negate any possibility of differences.
   There is one attachment with a file called Scenario.wrf.  This
   is a webex recording file.  To view this file, download it to
   your hard drive, then:
   1.  Open DS Webex Enterprise Site.
   2. My Webex   login (I only had to do this step when I was
   connected via VPN.  When I was logged directly into the DS
   network, the DS Webex Enterprise Site logged me in
   automatically.
   3. Select My Files from the navigation tree.
   4. Select the My Recordings Tab and click the Add Recording
   button.
   5. Enter any value for the Topic and Description, then select
   the Use the file on my local machine radio button.
   6. Browse for the Scenario.wrf file you downloaded.
   7. You must specify a length and since I didn t have any way
   of knowing how long the recording was, I specified 1 hour.
   That appeared to be ample time.
   8. You can set a password if you like.  I did not.
   9. Click the SAVE icon.  It will take a few minutes to save
   the information.
   10. Once the save is complete, browse over the right arrow at
   the end of the line.  The help says this is how you Playback.
   Click this button.
   11. A popup displays telling you the file is loading, then it
   automatically starts playing.
   12. Sound did not appear to be part of the recording as I got
   no sound even when I turned Mute off in the Settings.  I only
   had video.
   13. When I had seen the video, I clicked the X to close the
   Downloading file popup, although you can choose file/exit if
   you like.
