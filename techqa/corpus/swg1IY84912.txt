APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Database: N/A
   TME Framework: 411
   Install Method: FRESH
   TEC Version: 3.9 FIXPACK 4
   Risk Manager Version: N/A
   Websphere Server: N/A
   Endpoint Level: N/A
   TMR / TEC Same Machine: YES
   Affected Locale: N/A
   .
   Problem Description:
   .
   Netware adapter delays in sending events to TEC.
   
   Failing Component: TEC Adapter
   
    Last Known Good Level:
   Level 3 Acknowledged: DH
   
   Recreate.
   
   1)Install the adapter
   2)Configure the adapter to read logsources by adding:
      LogSources=sys:system\nwmon\state.csv
   3)Use the supplied "state.csv" file in that directory.
     copy and paste an individual line into the state.csv file.
     You will see that the event will sometimes be sent but other
     times will not be sent.
   4)copy and paste another event into the state.csv file
     You will see the first event at the tec server (wtdumprl
   output)
     but usually not the second event.
   
   This did not appear to happen duriing my testing when the
   adapter did not have a "LogSources" defined.  The customer
   reports that this was happening on every occasion.
   
   Will put customer logfiles in the appropriate apars directory of
   k2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Documentation does not specify how LogSource files are parsed
   for the Netware logfile adapter(TECADNW4.NLM).  This can lead to
   either delayed event processing or incorrect matching of
   multiline entries.
   
   Additonal Information:
   
   Our NW adapter parses any LogSource for either a "standard"
   SYS$LOG.ERR multi-line format entry or a single line which may
   or may not contain standard format elements. The "standard"
   format is a multiline entry where the initial line is indented
   by 0 or 1 space and subsequent lines are indented by more than 1
   space. The multiline entry is terminated by an empty line(just a
   newline).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Documentation update included in Fixpack Readme calling for the
   following change on page 115 Chapter 6 of the IBM Tivoli
   Enterprise Console: Adapters Guide to the second paragraph:
   
   
   
   NetWare server events are gathered from any ASCII log file
   residing on the NetWare server, such as the
   SYS:SYSTEM\SYS$LOG.ERR file.  The entries in these files can
   be either "standard" multiline entries as in
   SYS:\SYSTEM\SYS$LOG.ERR or single line entries.  The adapter
   does not process a log source entry until it encounters an "end
   of entry".  An "end of entry"  is indicated by either a new
   "start" entry or an empty line.  A start entry is defined as a
   line with 0 or 1 preceding spaces followed by text.  Therefore,
   when monitoring custom LogSources on Netware, each log source
   entry (single or multiline) should be generated such that an
   empty line follows.
