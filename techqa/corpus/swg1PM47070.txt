PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 7.0 modifications will be available in the Ocoter 10,
   2011 update to the Information Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   The following Version 7.0 issues are addressed:
   
   ID: PM47070
   Problem: A Web form does not submit a user name and a
   password to a Web server for Internet Explorer Version 6 and
   Internet Explorer Version 8. After a failure in SPENGO
   authentication, SPNEGO fallback occurs.  Subsequent  ?? ?orm
   logins ??  ?always fail because the web browser does not send
   userid/password.  The form logins should succeed because
   SPNEGO fallback has occurred.  The WebSphere Application
   Server information center Version 7.0 does not explain an
   appropriate way to ensure that these  ?? ?orm logins ??  ?
   successful and that the userid/password is passed forward by
   the web browser.
   
   Resolution:  Topic,  ?? ?PNEGO troubleshooting tips ??  ?i
   A new troubleshooting tip,  ?? ?PNEGO authentication fails wh
   web browser does not send a web form with the user id and
   password ??  ?is added to this topic and reads as follows:
   
   A form login fails when the browser does not send user id or
   password. This condition can occur when SPNEGO authentication
   fails and SPNEGO fallback occurs. You can work around this
   condition as described below. If you are using Microsoft
   Windows XP SP2 with Internet Explorer Version 6, you need to
   install the KB902409 fix module plus edit the registry as
   follows:
   key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER or
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\Main\Feat
   ureControl
   \FEATURE_HTTP_DISABLE_NTLM_PREAUTH_IF_ABORTED_KB902409
   name : Iexplore.exe
   type : REG_DWORD
   value: 1
   name : Explorer.exe
   type : REG_DWORD
   value: 1
   
   If you are using Microsoft Windows XP SP3 with Internet
   Explorer Version 6, you need to install the KB902409 fix
   module.  If you are using Microsoft Windows Version 7 with
   Internet Explorer Version 8, you need to install the KB902409
   fix module and edit the registry as follows:
   key  :
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Inte
   rnetSettings
   name : DisableNTLMPreAuth
   type : REG_DWORD
   value: 1

   Problem: If a user wants to use the eXtreme Scale dynamic
   cache provider, he must disable the disk offload functionality
   before he configures eXtreme Scale.
   
   Resolution: The topic following information will be added to
   the topic "Configuring dynamic cache (DynaCache) to use the
   WebSphere eXtreme Scale dynamic cache provider":
   
   The disk offload function should be disabled prior to
   configuring eXtremeScale. To disable the disk offload function:
   1. In the administrative console, click Servers > Server
   Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name >
   Container Services > Dynamic cache service.
   2. Locate the Enable disk offload property and unselect this
   property if it is selected.
   
   If you forget to disable disk offload prior to configuring
   eXtremeScale as the cache provider, use the following wsadmin
   commands to disable the disk offload function:
   1. Issue the following command to find the config object for
   the server:
   wsadmin>$AdminConfig list DynamicCache
   (cells/optimusprimeCell01/nodes/optimusprimeNode01/servers
   /server1|server.xml#dynamic_cache_name)
   2. Issue the following AdminConfig modify command to set
   diskoffload to false:
   wsadmin>$AdminConfig modify
   cells/optimusprimeCell01/nodes/optimusprimeNode01/servers
   /server1|server.xml#dynamic_cache_name)
   {{enableDiskOffload false}}
   3. Issue the following command to save this configuration
   change:
   wsadmin>$AdminConfig save
   
   This same information is dded to the Version 6.1 and 8.0
   Information Centers.

   Problem: A z/OS user cannot test connection for a Type 2
   datasource at the node scope because the node agent server
   process is run under subpool2 key2.
   
   Resolution: The following information will be added to the
   topic "Test connection service" in the z/OS and Multiplatform
   versions of the information center:
   
   Restriction: In a network deployment implementation of the
   application server, you cannot test connections for the
   following data sources at the node level or cluster level:
   
   - IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ data source with
   driver type 2
   - DB2 Universal JDBC Driver Provider data source with driver
   type 2
   
   You can create node level or cluster level configurations of
   the data sources for application use; these configurations
   should work properly in the run time environment. To
   successfully run the test connection on the data sources,
   however, you must test the data sources at the server level
   only. The application server will issue the following
   exception for a test connection at the node level:
   
   java.sql.SQLException: Failure in loading T2 native library
   db2jcct2DSRA0010E: SQL state = null, Error Code = -99,999
   
   In some cases, though, the error might be similar to the
   following message:
   
   T2zOS exception:
   [jcc][T2zos]T2zosReusableConnection.flowConnect:initRRSAFAttach
   :2528: Connection dead
   
   Both of these data sources are based on type 2 JDBC drivers,
   which need access to the T2 native libraries. The run time
   environment for the application server provides that access
   for data sources in a server process, but the test connection
   service does not provide access to these native files when it
   is run in the node agent process.
   
   Therefore, when you create these data sources at the node
   scope or cluster scope, you might want to temporarily create
   the same configurations at a server scope for testing
   purposes. Run the test connection operation at the server
   level to determine if the data source settings are valid for
   your overall configuration.
   
   This information is also added to the z/OS and Multiplatform
   versions of the Version 6.1 and 8.0 Information Centers.

   ID: 718197
   Problem: WebSphere Application Server does not support .gzip
   files. The reference to .gzip need to be removed.
   
   Resolution: The references to .gzip files will be removed.
   This same change will be made to the Version 6.1 and 8.0
   Information Centers.
   -------------------------------------------
   
   ID: 718200
   Problem: The external link to the Key and Certificate
   Management Tool in the topic "Configuring key locators using
   an assembly tool" needs to be updated to link to the
   appropriate Oracle web page.
   
   Resolution: The link will be updated.
   
   This same change is made to the Version 6.1 and 8.0
   Information Centers.
   -----------------
   Additional changes will be made to the Version 7.0
   Information Center for the October, 2011 update. For more
   information about these changes, see APAR PM49209 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM49209].
