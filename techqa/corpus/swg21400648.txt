QUESTION
 How do you get ruleset information in a Rule Execution Server environment? 

ANSWER
The Rule Execution Server architecture hides the engine object and therefore the ruleset object from the user: because the ruleset is deployed and managed through the Rule Execution Server console and the engine is handled through a rule session object, the application cannot access the IlrContext object that would in turn allow access to the IlrRuleset object used by the current rule execution.
Rule Execution Server is designed to auto-manage rule execution, hiding these operations from the user and thus making applications much easier to deploy and maintain. 

It is nevertheless still possible to get information on deployed rulesets from the application; this can be achieved using the JMX API which uses the MBean to retrieve the information: IlrJMXRepositoryMBean , IlrJMXRuleAppMBean and IlrJMXRulesetMBean available under ilog.rules.res.model.mbean.

The product JMX remote sample located at WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Samples > Rule Execution Server samples > Automated ruleset management sample [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6MTS_7.1.1/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global1756.html] illustrates the use of the Rule Execution Server JMX API. 

You can refer to the API documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/model/mbean/package-summary.html] and the below link for more information.
