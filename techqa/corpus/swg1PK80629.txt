   The Information Centers for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 and Version 7.0 do not document the use of the
   com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies security
   custom property.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Security custom properties" topic in the Information
   Center for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 and
   Version 7.0 will be updated with the following information to
   describe the com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies
   security custom property:
   
   com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies
   Cookies that contain sensitive values need to be protected by
   setting the secure and HTTP-only flags for cookies whose
   values are set by the server. You configure WebSphere
   Application Server so that it sets the HTTP-only flag for the
   LTPA cookies by setting
   the com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies custom
   property with a true value.
   
   A common security problem plaguing Web servers is cross-site
   scripting. Cross-site scripting is a server-side vulnerability
   that is often created when rendering user input as HTML.
   Cross-site scripting attacks can expose sensitive information
   about the users of the Web site. In order to help mitigate the
   risk of cross-site scripting, a new feature has been
   introduced in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. This Microsoft
   Internet Explorer 6 feature is a new attribute for cookies,
   which prevents them from being accessed through client-side
   script. A cookie with this attribute is called an HTTP-only
   cookie. Any information contained in an HTTP-only cookie is
   less likely to be disclosed to a hacker or a malicious Web site.
   You use the com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies
   custom property with a true value to allow WebSphere
   Application Server to properly recognize, accept and process
   HTTP-Only cookies and inhibit any cross-site scripting from
   accessing sensitive cookie information.
   Default false
   
   Update from APAR PK82764 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK82764]
   This APAR changed the "Security custom properties" topic
   in the Information Center for WebSphere Application
   Server Versions 6.1 and 7.0.
   The com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies
   property description now reads as follows:
   com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies
   This custom property enables you to set the HTTPOnly attribute
   for single sign-on (SSO) cookies.
   
   You can use the
   com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies custom
   property to protect cookies that contain sensitive values.
   When you set this custom property value to true, the
   application server sets the secure and HTTPOnly attribute for
   SSO cookies whose values are set by the server. The HTTPOnly
   attribute enables the protection of sensitive values in
   cookies.
   
   Also, a true value enables the application server to properly
   recognize, accept, and process inbound cookies with HTTPOnly
   attributes and inhibit any cross-site scripting from accessing
   sensitive cookie information.
   
   A common security problem, which impacts Web servers, is
   cross-site scripting. Cross-site scripting is a server-side
   vulnerability that is often created when user input is
   rendered as HTML. Cross-site scripting attacks can expose
   sensitive information about the users of the Web site. Most
   modern Web browsers honor the HTTPOnly attribute to prevent
   this attack. A cookie with this attribute is called an
   HTTPOnly cookie. Information that exists in an HTTPOnly cookie
   is less likely to be disclosed to a hacker or a malicious Web
   site. For more information about the HTTPOnly attribute, see
   the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Web site.
   
   Important: When you use this custom property, HTTPOnly
   attribute is not added to every cookie that passes through the
   application server. Also, the attribute is not added to other
   non-secure cookies that are created by the application server.
   A list of non-HTTPOnly cookies includes:
   - JSESSIONID cookies
   - SSO cookies that are created by authenticators or providers
   from another software vendor
   - Client or browser cookies that do not already contain the
   HTTPOnly attribute
   Default: false
   
   
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the current
   documentation before you read this text. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   and select the version and product that is appropriate for
   your WebSphere Application Server environment. The modified
   documentation will be available in the October 2009 update to
   the Information Centers.
