APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Data bindings are not generated while the adapter is being
   installed in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.0.1.2 and
   V8.5.0.x. This issue occurs when the .ear file is included
   with a process app or the Service Deploy feature is used.
   
   The installation will succeed without errors but the data
   binding for the adapter is not generated, which leads to
   runtime errors in the log files that are similar to the
   following errors:
   
   java.lang.NullPointerException
       at com.ibm.j2ca.sap.SAPInteraction.doExecute
          (SAPInteraction.java:97)
       at com.ibm.j2ca.base.WBIInteraction.execute
          (WBIInteraction.java:522)
       at com.ibm.ws.sca.binding.j2c.J2CMethodBindingImpl.invoke
         (J2CMethodBindingImpl.java:1204)
   
   These errors occur because the installation process refers to
   a missing binding class that should be generated during
   deployment time. The class name depends on what is set for the
   data binding of the import or export.
   
   
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   com.ibm.xmlns.prod.websphere.j2ca.sap.
   sapbapigetdetail.MySAPGetdetailDataBinding
    at java.lang.Class.forNameImpl(Native Method)
    at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:213)
    at com.ibm.ws.sca.binding.j2c.handler.J2CImportHandler$1.run
       (J2CImportHandler.java:261)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is not a workaround if the adapter needs to be included in
   a snapshot. If it is being installed as an EAR then you
   should generate the ear from IID.
