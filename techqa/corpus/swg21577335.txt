 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to determinate MSA500 locks and How to bring it back to life 

ANSWER
An extreme heavy I/O going to MSA500 may cause the locked up. 

Symptoms: 1. In /var/log/message, you should be able to find “Event Log Daemon:[3303]: SCSI bus speed downshifted, SCSI port 1”. 3. nz login hang to active host hangs but root login fine 3. df would hang at nz partition 

 

For customer doesn't have root password, you have them or HP to do following:
1. The customers or HP needs to have physical access to Netezza machine.
2. Power off MSA500
3. Power off Active host, ha1 (I assume HA1 as active host from now on)
4. Power off standby host, ha2
5. Wait few minutes so it would give some time for all RAID drive top stop.
6. Power on MSA500
7. Have the customers or HP to look at the LED on MSA500 and wait until the LED on MSA500 saying it is online and ready. Generally, it would take 15 mins, it takes some times for MSA500 to boot up and check the disks.
8. Power on HA1
9. Wait until you see login at the console on HA1. You may want to have customers to look at the console to make sure there is no error message.
10. Login HA1 as nz and check following: "df" to make sure nz is there, "nzstate" to see if the system is online.
11. Power on HA2
12. Wait until you see login at the console on HA2.
13. Do a quick health check on ha2: "df" to make sure nz is NOT there. Bot machines should NOT have nz mount at the same time.

For customers that we have root access:
1. Login in either HA! or HA2 as root or nz
2. telnet to RPC rack 1 lower right (rpc1lr or 10.0.0.167)
3. You should see an item saying "SmartArray-Right"
4. Type "off <item number>" - to shut off the power to the right power supply of Smart Array
5. "Exit"
6. telnet to RPC rack 1 lower left (rpc1ll or 10.0.0.67)
7. You should see an item saying "SmartArray-Left"
8. Type "off <item number>" - to shut off power supply to left of Smart Array
9. Type "on <item number>" - to tyrn on power supply back on
10. Type "Exit"
11. telnet to RPC rack 1 lower right (rpc1lr or 10.0.0.167)
12. You should see an item saying "SmartArray-Right"
13. Type "on <item number>" - to turn the power back on for right power supply of Smart Array
14. You just power reset the Smart Array MSA500. Now, wait 10-15 mins for Smart Array to boot up and check the disks.
15. Go to HA1 and issue "reboot"to reboot the HA1 and then wait until HA1 is up
16. Login HA1 and make sure HA1 mount nz and nzstate show online
17. Once HA1 is fine, login HA2 and reboot HA2
