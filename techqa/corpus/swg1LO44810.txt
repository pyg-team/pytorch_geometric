ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
   ===========================
   Using a repeat table, a label being displayed by the Viewer
   causes truncation on the last row.
   
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   ===========================
   Lotus Forms Viewer 3.5.1 GA
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the repeat structure add a check to see if the value is
   empty, ie. [testValue != ''] to
   nodeset="instance('test')/rows/row[testValue != '']
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The Viewer is properly handling tables.  In this particular case
   the table rows had a negative padding and empty rows were being
   added to the table which is what caused the truncation.  There
   is no error in the IBM Viewer code.
