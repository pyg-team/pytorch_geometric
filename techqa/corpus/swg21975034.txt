ITX WTX Hypervisor Edition security vulnerability Transformation Extender SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities have been addressed in the GSKit component of IBM Transformation Extender Hypervisor Edition for AIX. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-0201 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0201]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a MD5 collision. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109310] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-7421 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7421]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The internal ICC PRNG pool state is duplicated during a fork() system call operation which results in a period of time where child processes may generate identical PRNG output to the parent. This may allow possible attacks related to predictable state which an attacker could exploit.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-7420 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7420]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The GSKit PRNG state is duplicated during a fork() system call operation which results in a period of time where child processes may generate identical PRNG output to the parent.

 01 February 2016: Original version published.
02 February 2016: Removed search link for version 8.x fixes since those versions get security via Secure Adapter Collection which are part of the base WebSphere Transformation Extender product set (not the Hypervisor Edition product).
