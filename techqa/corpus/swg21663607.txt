Title: IBM TIP 2.2 Base in Netcool Omnibus WebGUI 7.4 install is failing - United States

Text:
TIPL2INST; TIP; Netcool; Omnibus; WebGUI; 7.4 install; 2.2 Base TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The prerequisite check, done when the Tivoli Integrated Portal portion starts, fails because the upgrade doesn't have permission to execute the precheck script, TIPInstall_PreCheck.sh, which is on the cdimage. 

SYMPTOM
Product install log: OMNIbusWebGUI_Install-00.log 

FINE : ########### Start TIPInstall_PreCheck : Validate Prerequisites############## (from com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.tasks.COIExtensionIALog.execute)
INFO : [echo] Validate the supported Operation System and Version, the minimum size of Hard Disk and Memory and eWAS/WAS version, necessary System Packages (from AntRuntime.execute)
INFO : [mkdir] Created dir: /app/netcool/tip/logs (from AntRuntime.execute)
INFO : [echo] ***************here catch the exception*************** (from AntRuntime.execute)


SEVERE : Aborting installer:/app/netcool/omnibus/omnibus_webgui/_uninst/OMNIbusWebGUI740/plan not found. (from com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.plugin.COIProcessChecksLogicalComponent.install)

#### Errors from the DeploymentPlan.log from the 

/app/netcool/tip/_uninst/OMNIbusWebGUI740/plan/checks/MachinePlan_localhost/MachinePlan_localhost.xml:124: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/app/netcool/tip/_uninst/OMNIbusWebGUI740/plan/checks/MachinePlan_localhost/MachinePlan_localhost.xml:152: Error executing step: An error was encountered running step TIPInstall_PreCheck 

 

TIPInstall_PreCheck.log doesn't contain any useful information: 

validatePrereqs:
[echo] Validate the supported Operation System and Version, the minimum size of Hard Disk and Memory and eWAS/WAS version, necessary System Packages
[mkdir] Created dir: /app/netcool/tip/logs
[echo] ***************here catch the exception***************



CAUSE
The cdimage was unpacked as root and the install was done as a regular user. Therefore the TIPInstall_PreCheck.sh script could not execute, because it was owned by root.


ENVIRONMENT
OMNIbus 7.4.0.0 fresh install with TIP 2.2.0.0 base.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
On the cdimage you can run this script to see if it will execute:
./TIPInstall_PreCheck.sh -c TIPInstall_PreCheck.cfg -i <TIP_HOME>



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You will have to either 

1) Unpack the cdimage as the same userid as the install will be done 

2) or change the permission's on all files under the cdimage directory to read/write for everyone. 

Then re-try the upgrade.
