You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Impact tries to reduce the number of events to read so that it
   doesn't exceed its queue size but then reads the whole lot in
   anyway.
   
   The problem is that Impact reads all the events if it finds the
   number of events per second more than the maxeventsperquery.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increase the event threshold to a high value (e.g. something
   over 5,000 if sending through 25,000 events in 5 seconds)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Netcool/Impact users monitoring the  *
   *                 events per seconds                           *

   Replication Steps:
   
   1. Configure the EventReader - uncheck Get Updates , 2. Stop
   the EventReader. 3. Send lots of events to the Object Server
   while EventReader is down 4. Then start the EventReader 5.
   Impact will read all events.
