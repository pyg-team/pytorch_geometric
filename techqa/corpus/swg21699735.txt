QUESTION
 How can one customize dashboard for Linux OS monitoring agent in APMUI? 

CAUSE
You want to show different attributes on Linux OS dashboard than the ones displayed on out of the box (OOTB) agent dashboard.

ANSWER
The "customBuilder" utility can be used to add a new dashboard category to include in the customized dashboard. It does not modify the default OOTB dashboard, instead it creates the new customized dashboard.
As described in user guide, for option "-i", the id should be without "_". The tool adds "_" automatically to distinguish it from the OOTB dashboard.
The command is as follows:

./customBuilder.sh -i klz -u apmadmin -p apmpass -o 8080 -d /opt/IBM/tmp/klz/


- where the custom jsons are placed in /opt/IBM/tmp/klz/ directory.

And then you see this result:

[root]:customCfg>./customBuilder.sh -i klz -u apmadmin -p apmpass -o 8080 -d /opt/IBM/tmp/klz/
Note: ID must start with "_" and it is prefixed automatically.

After that, go back to APMUI and add/modify application for new component Linux OS(_KLZ), as shown in the screen print below:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699735&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699735&aid=1]

This is the one you just added. You also see the original OOTB component "Linux OS".

When you add an instance from the new component, you see the result as defined in the custom jsons.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699735&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699735&aid=2]


The custom dashboard (in screen print above) was created using the sample jsons provided with APMUI installation. These json files are found under following folder:
APMUI_HOME/usr/servers/apmui/apps/resources/samples/klz

You can also modify or delete your customized dashboard with customBuilder tool, the steps and samples are in the User's Guide
