PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Table "<Schema>"."<Table Name>" could not be found in the database. Error message shows up when doing Table Mapping on Management Console. 

SYMPTOM
When doing a table mapping with DB2 as source, selecting a
table which contains special characters on column comments like:

COMMENT ON COLUMN <Schema>.<Table Name>.<Column> 
IS 'Test comment ‘1’ complete';

Mapping fails with following error message:
Table <Schema>.<Table Name> could not be found in the database.


CAUSE
If operating system and database codepage both are UTF-8, but the data to be inserted is not Unicode, then data in the database might have incorrect codepoints (not-Unicode).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Either remove special character from comment or follow the procedure from DB2 Technote number: 1412846
