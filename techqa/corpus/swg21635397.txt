 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have completed migrating Collaboration and Deployment Services (CADS) from 4.2.1 to 5.0. After doing this the 'Content Repository Endpoint' (under the Configuration section 'Repository') within the Deployment Manager Web client continues to point at the previous CADS URI location. Is this something to be concerned about? 

CAUSE
Unknown

ANSWER
The 'Content Repository Endpoint' is strictly used for CADS Web Services. Update the URI to point to the current '<Server>:<port>/cr-ws/services/ContentRepository' value.
