ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Application Support for a product cannot be removed
   from the TEPS and TEMS on Linux/UNIX environment.
   
   Uninstall of ITCAM for RTT TEMA when TEMS, TEPS, TEMA and
   RTT Management server are on the same system leaves TEMS and
   TEPS support installed. When you attempt to reinstall the TEMA
   and supporting files, it will not allow you to re-install the
   TEMS/TEPS support as it thinks it is already installed.
   
   Steps to reproduce.
   Windows 2003 Server (probable broke on all OS).
   1. Install ITM 6.1 (we are using FP3, but I have seen it wih
   FP05 also)
   2. Install ITCAM RTT MS (this can probable be on another box but
   you need one somewhere to point the RTT TEMA to, Patch to at
   least FP02).
   
   3. Install ITCAm for RTT TEMA, TEPS, TEMS and Desktop Support on
   ITM server.
   
   4. Apply ITCAM for RTT TEMA FP02 and TEPS, TEMS and Desktop
   Support on ITM server.
   
   5. Uninstall ITCAM for RTT TEMA and TEPS, TEMS and Desktop
   Support on ITM server.
   
   6. run the KinCinfo.exe and you will note that the T2 support is
   still on the ITM server.
   .
   ITM 6.3 release does NOT support programmatic
   removal of application support.
   .
   This is explained in the Installation Guide
   in section:
   Appendix H: Uninstalling IBM Tivoli Monitoring
     Uninstalling an individual IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent
       or component.
   .
   DCF technote 1296601 instructions apply to
   6.23 and 6.3 releases.
