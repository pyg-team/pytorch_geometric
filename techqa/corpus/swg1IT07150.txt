APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The HL7DFDLOutput node sends an HL7 message to a TCP/IP port and
   expects an HL7 ACK in return. If the ACK does not contain the
   correct HL7 segments (missing MSA segment) then the node does
   not report an error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The HL7DFDLOutput node can be replaced with a subflow that
   performs the same role but additionally validates the ACK.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack V3.0
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The HL7DFDLOUTPUT node accepts an invaid ACK message with MSA
   segment missing.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

   tools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now checks the MSA segment of an ACK message
   received by the HL7DFDLOutput node. If no MSA segment is
   present, or no acknowledgement code (MSA.1) is present, or no
   message control ID (MSA.2) is present, it will provide an error
   message.
