SUMMARY
 OpenSource Apache Poi Vulnerabilities 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2012-0213 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0213]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of memory when processing certain Channel Definition Format (CDF)/ Compound File Binary Format (CFBF) documents. By sending a specially-crafted CDF / CFBF file to an application using Apache POI, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75558 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/75558] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3574 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3574]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OOXML file to consume all available CPU resources and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2014-3529 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3529]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error within the OPC SAX setup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OpenXML file containing an XML external entity declaration to read arbitrary files on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-9527 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9527]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted PPT file to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop and deadlock.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99799 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99799] for the current score
