LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Windows OS Agent not monitored on Itanium 64-bit machine.
   
   The Monitoring Agent for Windows OS running on an Itanium 64-bit

   "Proxy Agent Services Watchdog" in the Agent Management Services
   workspace.   As a result, these are not managed by the Proxy
   Agent Services Watchdog function.

   Windows OS" and "Proxy Agent Services Watchdog" on Itanium
   64-bit.
