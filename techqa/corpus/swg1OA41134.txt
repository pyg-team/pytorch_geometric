PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new section is added to the Planning and Configuration Guide

   Chapter 1. Introducing Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging on z/OS
       New in this release
           New features affect the configuration <<< NEW >>>
   
   the content is as follows:
   
   The following new features of OMEGAMON XE for Messaging on z/OS
   affect the configuration:
   
   . Support for self-describing agents. See Tivoli Management
     Services.
   
     The OMEGAMON XE for WebSphere MQ agent and WebSphere Message
     Broker agent are installed with self-describing support
     enabled. Once self-description is enabled at the hub Tivoli
     Enterprise Monitoring Server that the agent is reporting to,
     the application support file updates are automatically
     synchronized, and, if relevant, the updates are deployed to
     the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the connected
     Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server.
   
     In order to support self-describing processing, minimum
     values are required for the following TMS:Engine parameters.
   
     LIMIT(23,X)
     MINIMUM(300000,X)
   
     These parameters are generated in the RKANPARU library of
     the KMQSYSIN or KQISYSIN member.
