PROBLEM
The Script Portlet import and export functionality does not work properly when running in a virtual portal context. 

SYMPTOM
The import and export dialogs fail with an error message from WCM indicating an error like this:
Cannot create ID. Reason: 248cc021-2a50-4692-90e8-f2eb2d0c1c6b


CAUSE
This is a known limitation of the Script Portlet import and export functionality. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to work with Script Portlet instances in a virtual portal, the Script Portlet editor or WCM Authoring tools must be used to create the Script Portlet content.
