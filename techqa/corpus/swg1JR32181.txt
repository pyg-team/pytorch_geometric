ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Regression of APAR JR28854 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR28854]
   ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   When invoking a web service while using dynamic endpoint SCA API
   to  change the endpoint, the web service timeout value will
   always uses the default value (300 seconds or 5 minutes).  A
   user configured value will not be honored.
   
   A standard invoke that does not use the dynamic endpoint API
   will honor the user configured value and does not show this
   problem.
   
   
   This APAR corrects the behavior so that the user
   configurable  value will take effect.The value can be configured
   within the admin console under the Web Service Client Bindings
   for the particular application module.
   
   A sample of the invoke call using the API is as follows:
   
   EndpointReference eRef =
   EndpointReferenceFactory.INSTANCE.createEndpointReference();
   eRef.setAddress("http://localhost:9081/ramExportWeb/sca/ramLib
   InterfaceExport1");
   Service sv =
   (Service)ServiceManager.INSTANCE.getService("ramLibInterfacePart
   ner", eRef);
     DataObject response = (DataObject)sv.invoke("operation1",
   "Testdata");

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: No user is affected because customer/L2/L3   *
   *                 could not replicate this issue.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A binding was replaced by a Service     *
   *                      Component Architecture (SCA)            *
   *                      invocation to resolve JR28854 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR28854] could     *
   *                      have caused regression.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem is that customer has a long running process which
   uses late binding to start another long running process. The
   customer said that in this scenario the activity that starts
   long running process moves to stopped state.  They suspected
   this as a regression of JR28854 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR28854]. But when
   development wanted to replicate the issue to analyze and
   resolve it then neither the customer nor L2/L3 could
   replicate the issue therefore we decided to cancel the defect.
