Title: IBM Upgrade from IBM Tivoli Common Reporting v2.1 to v2.1.1 fails due to many Interim Fixes - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a customer has IBM Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) v2.1 installed and they have applied v2.1 Interim Fix 3 onwards, and then they choose to upgrade v2.1 to v2.1.1, at this time upgrade fails. 

SYMPTOM
Upgrade fails at TCRCore_Upgrade step of the install


CAUSE
Cause of the issue is because of mentioning only Interim Fix1 and Interim Fix2 in the <TCR2.1.1_image_extract>/TCRInstaller/COI/PackageSteps/TCRCore_Upgrade/META-INF/packagedIU.xml 

<supersededFixes>TCR-2100-0001 TCR-2100-0002</supersededFixes>
<supersededFixes>SIU-TCR-2100-0001 SIU-TCR-2100-0002</supersededFixes>

This file and the above tags are used during TCR upgrade and as per the above statement, TCR v2.1.1 installation will override only the first 2 Interim Fixes and not the rest (Interim Fix3 onwards) and hence the problem.


ENVIRONMENT
All supported TCR environments with v2.1 and Interim Fix 3 onwards installed



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem can be resolved just by editing an XML file and then restarting the installation, as per the steps given below.
