QUESTION
 Why do my Transaction Reporter workspaces turn gray in the TEP and stop displaying data? The Transaction Reporter process is still running. 

CAUSE
The TEPS frequently disconnects from the TEMS.

ANSWER

When the TEPS resides on AIX, the Transaction Reporter workspaces may go gray (disabled) due to a TEPS 6.x defect. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication errors appear in the TEPS *_cq_KfwServices_5*.log files on the TEPS host. 

This defect causes the TEPS to constantly lose connection with the hub TEMS.

Error seen in multiple TEPS logs: 

(56D232A2.0002-91:kdcc1sr.c,924,"rpc__sar") Conversation timeout: 
"ip.pipe:#172.16.78.41:1918", 1C010008:00000000, 0, 121(0), FFFF/43, 
D140831.1:1.1.1.13, tms_ctbs630fp5:d5135a 

If you observe this error in the TEPS logs, try installing the fix for APAR IV77462 at the TEPS. See details in the Related URLs. 

A separate issue is that you may also need to prevent the Transaction Reporter from switching network interface cards.

Bind the TO agent a network card using the KDEB_INTERFACELIST setting in the ITM_HOME/config/to.ini file on the Transaction Reporter host. This setting prevents the TO agent from switching network interface cards and appearing to disconnect from the TEPS.

KDEB_INTERFACELIST=<nic-ip-address> 

where <nic-ip-address> is the IP address of one of the network interface card. 

After adding KDEB_INTERFACELIST to the to.ini file, restart the Transaction Reporter.
