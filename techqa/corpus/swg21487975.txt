 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 C&DS 4.0.3 patch fails, 'java.sql.SQLException: The connection does not exist'

C&DS 4.0 has been installed successfully on the iSeries. Upon starting the WebSphere instance, we can connect with Deployment Portal, Deployment Manager and WebSphere Console. We have successfully applied both BIRT and PEV packages.

Prior to applying patch, WebSphere instance is restarted and the interactive session CCSID is set to 37. The same profile used to install C&DS is also used to apply the patch.

Patch is located in the correct directory:
/cads40/patching/CADS_PATCH_4.0.3 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restart server and test - could be noise messages

Patch may have been applied successfully. Seems to be a problem specific to V6R1.

C&DS 5 will be modified to eliminate this message
