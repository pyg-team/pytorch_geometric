QUESTION
 How can I detect new SQL reserved words that are embedded in my program? My program, which was developed using the old DB2 release, might use these new reserved words as SQL ordinary identifiers. 

ANSWER
In DB2® in the z/OS™ and OS/390® environments, you can do one of the following two things: 

 * Exhaustively search the source code for uses of any of the new reserved words as ordinary identifiers in SQL statements, and then change or delimit them 
 * Precompile all the programs and check for syntax errors


Recommendation: set a shop standard to always delimit identifiers in SQL statements. Many tools that generate SQL already delimit identifiers to prevent the need to change source code for new releases.
