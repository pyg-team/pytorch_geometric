ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario:
   1) Tools / Options / Infrastructure / Product Structure
        Set Work with the cache system : ON
   2) File / Open *.CATProduct.
   3) File / New Drawing.
   4) Click on the Front View icon
   5) Change active window to CATProduct and select any face.
   6) Click on the 2D sheet to generate the view
   7) Change active window to CATProduct and expand tree.
   -> Parts in No-Show are in design mode
   .
   Expected Result :
   No show components should be in Visualization Mode

COMMENTS
 *  Dear Customer:  we have reviewed the problem report you
   submitted and determined that the function referenced is
   working within the scope of the original design
   specification. However we recognize the value of your
   feedback and will consider including resolution of this issue
   as a product enhancement in a future release, if one is made
   available.  We thank you for your input.
   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   Our selective loading works as designed although it looks to
   be not optimized.
   By-Pass:
   Create a particular product for each configuration.
   Development Request Justification:
   There is no deffect in our selective loading processing. The
   scenario that was detailed here is indeed correct. (at first
   sight as we read the scenario only one part should be in
   design mode, the other should be loaded in BRep mode only and
   not design. But it depends mainly on what options were
   activated).
   The way the different loading modes are switched from one to
   another are not detailed.
   This process needs absolutely no intervention from the user.
   The user does not have to take care about although it has an
   impact on the capacity.
   Function of the generative options or of the 3D design
   applicative content a particular loading mode can be
   requested even if it does not seems obvious (or at the
   opposite seems to be incorrect).
   The current algorithms could appear as not optimized but
   actually work fine. This is due to internal constraints we do
   not want to detail. We keep on trying to optimize these
   algorithms (mainly by reducing/removing these constraints)
   releases after releases.
