ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Abstract: MS Traps do not fire for Portal request events
   
   ---------------------------------
   Users Affected: Users setting traps against Portal requests
   
   ---------------------------------
   Problem Description: Traps created to fire against the names of
   Portal request events are never triggered
   
   The customer creates some Portal type events by accessing WAS
   Portal applications. The portal request events are verified when
   looking at Server Activity Display (in the Recent Requests tab)
   and in the Performance Analysis Reports.
   
   However if the customer takes the string that forms the name of
   the Portal request event and uses this to create a trap, it
   never triggers even though we are sure the portal event was
   created

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Traps created to fire against the names of
   Portal request events are never triggered
   The customer creates some Portal type events by accessing WAS
   Portal applications. The portal request events are verified when
   looking at Server Activity Display (in the Recent Requests tab)
   and in the Performance Analysis Reports.
   However if the customer takes the string that forms the name of

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The traps were not triggered for portal
   requests because DC was never sending a request name in the
   entry/start request. DC only sent request name in the exit
   record. Venkatesh said it is tricky to fix this on DC side so I
   fixed it on MS side with a workaround. I am bypassing the
   condition for portal server where traps condition are checked
   for entry event.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in 7.1.0.3 Ifix4
