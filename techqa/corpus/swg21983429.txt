If you have already purchased DB2 10.5, as indicated within the above link, one of the following part numbers can be downloaded depending on the platform you are on:

If you need help navigating the Passport Advantage website to search by part number, see: How do I download my DB2 license from Passport Advantage [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21305417] 


Within the license folder of the extracted package, you will find the sam41.lic file

To apply the license, use the samlicm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRM2X_4.1.0/com.ibm.samp.doc_4.1/samprgsamlicm.html] command as root:
samlicm -i sam41.lic

Once the license has been installed on all nodes the domain must be restarted (if there is one) for the license to be recognized.
If there currently is no domain configured then the license will be recognized when a domain is created.
