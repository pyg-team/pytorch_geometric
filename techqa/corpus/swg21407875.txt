QUESTION
 What is the difference between the disktag.inf and the respository.config files used when installing IBM Rational ClearCase or IBM Rational ClearQuest? 

CAUSE
 

When you, from IBM Installation Manager, add a repository to install ClearCase, a ClearCase fix pack or other IBM Rational Applications, you will sometimes see a 'diskTag.inf' file and sometimes a 'repository.config' file.



ANSWER
 


Difference between repository.config and diskTag.inf

Repository.config is a file that can be created when using the IBM Packaging Utility or obtained from the installation files. For fix packs, this file is usually in the install_files\RationalProduct directory. 

diskTag.inf indicates to Installation Manager that the files are from a disk image. 
diskTag.inf can be across multiple disks. You can not create a diskTag.inf with Packaging Utility but you can select a diskTag.inf in Packaging Utility. diskTag.inf cannot be used from a http server. Fix packs do not contain a diskTag.inf. 

You will only have a 'Disktag.inf' for a 'major release' package. A 'major release' would be ClearCase 7.1, 7.1.1 or 7.1.2. 

 

Additional Notes 

In a 'major release' for Microsoft Windows you will also have a folder called InstallerImage_win32 (which is the Installation Manager) and within that folder you have a 'Repository.config'. That 'Repository.config' is for installing Installation Manager. You can look into the 'Repository.config' and see what it is for. This is not a file that can be selected through the Installation Manager for any upgrade. 

Additionally, in a ClearCase Fix pack you will not have 'Disktag.inf' and you will not have an Installation Manager included (so no InstallerImage_win32 folder). Here you will have a 'Repository.config' to install the ClearCase Fix pack from Installation Manager. 


It should also be noted that if you install initially with launchpad.exe that is only shipped with disk images, it uses the disktag.inf file and not respository.config. 

Of special consideration, when you create a repository using the IBM Packaging Utility, you will have no 'Disktag.inf' to select as part of a final installable version. In this case here you will have a 'Repository.config'.
