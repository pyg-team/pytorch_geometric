QUESTION
How can an unwanted status message be removed from the Sametime Connect client? For example, a user has created a status message in the Sametime Connect client for a specific situation and would like to delete that entry.

ANSWER
Within the user interface, you can reset the status messages to the product defaults, which removes all custom messages. For example, in the Sametime Connect client, click File > Preferences > Status Messages>Restore Defaults. 

If you do not want to clear all messages, you can edit the file where the messages are stored. 

Status messages are stored in the community-config.xml file. 

You can open the community-config.xml file using a text editor (such as Notepad; TextEdit on Mac; vi on Linux) and remove the unwanted status message(s). 

First, locate the file. 

For Sametime 8.x - On Windows, status messages are stored here: 

 * 
 * 
 * ...where {ApplicationData} is the hidden Application Data folder located under the Windows User Profile in the Documents and Settings folder.


For Sametime 8.x - on Mac, status messages are stored here:  * 
 * 
 * ...where $HOME is the user's Home directory. 
 * Note: Library is a hidden file and will require using Cmd-Shift in an Open File dialog in TextEdit or other plain text editor. You can also use Cmd-Shift-G to type in a specific folder.


For Sametime embedded in the Notes client on Windows, status messages are stored here:  * 
 * 


For Sametime embedded in Notes on Linux systems, check for  * 
 * 


For Sametime 9.x, the community-config.xml is stored in the following locations: 

Windows 7  * 
 * AppData\Roaming\IBM\Sametime\.metadata\.plugins\com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community.sametime\community-config.xml 
 * 
 * 
 * Lotus\notes\Data\workspace\.metadata\.plugins\com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community.sametime\community-config.xml 
   

Mac OSX  * 
 * same as Sametime 8.x 
   
 * 
 * /Users/Support/Library/Application Support/IBM Notes Data/Expeditor/Applications/.metadata/.plugins/com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.community.sametime 

Next, open the file in a text editor and remove the unwanted status messages. The syntax in the community-config.xml displays as: 

 * 
 * <activeText>I am available</activeText>
 * 
 * <activeText>Delete this status</activeText>
 * 
 * <awayText>Gone to lunch</awayText>
 * 
 * <inMtgText>I am in a meeting</inMtgText>
 * 
 * <dndText>Please do not disturb me</dndText>



The brackets define what status the text is for, as follows: Status Syntax Active <activeText> Away <awayText> In a meeting <inMtgText> Do not disturb <dndText> 
To remove the status active text that says "Delete this Status", use these steps: 
 1. Highlight the entire line of <activeText>Delete this status</activeText> 
 2. Delete the line. Repeat this for all instances of the "Delete this Status" text in the file. 
 3. Save the file and exit the text editor. 
 4. Exit the Sametime Connect client. 
 5. The next time you start Sametime Connect client the unwanted status message will be removed.






Additional information 

The status messages are stored in the buddylist.xml file, buddylist.xml.bak, community-config.xml, and in the vpuserinfo.nsf (contact list & preferences database on the server). 

When you make changes to community-config.xml, those changes propagate to the other files. 

The buddylist.* files are found in the com.ibm.collaboration.realtime.imhub subdirectory of the same plugins directory listed above. 

An enhancement request (see APAR LO63333 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO63333&crawler=1]) has been submitted to improve deletion of individual status messages.
