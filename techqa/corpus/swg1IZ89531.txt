Title: IBM IZ89531: DEACTIVATINF CORES ON IBM HS22 BLADESERVER WITH 2 QUAD CORE XEON 55XX PROCESSORS - United States

APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deactivating Processor Cores is not reflected in License Metric
   Tool
    Limited the number of available cores to
    four.
    Waited for several days allowing LMT to do its periodic
   aggregation, but LMT is
    still counting 8x70=560 PVU s  for this server.
    We see a change in the number of logical pcores on the
   partition
    (from16 to 8), but no effect on the PVU calculation.
   
   
   Found defect in the code that is causing the machine capacity to
   be wrongly calculated.
   This  is a defect on LMT server side in the aggregation process.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On the physical machine without any virtualization in case when
   number of logical processors is bigger than the number of
   physical cores the machine subcapacity is set to the number of
   logical processors instead of number of physical processor
   cores. This can happen only on physical server with no
   virtualization and on x86. Other platforms are not affected.
   
   The aggregation code will be changes to address this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  There is no simple workaround for this issue. In case such
   behavious is observed, please contact IBM support and the fix
   will be provided on demand.
