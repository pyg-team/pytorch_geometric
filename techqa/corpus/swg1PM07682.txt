APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ClearCase RWP fails to install IHS due to lack of disk space,
   though there is ample space available
   
   
   AIX 5.3
   
   ClearCase 7.0.1.7 RWP
   
   
   To Reproduce:
   
   Reproduction is only possible if the ?df -k? command returns ?A
   file, file system or message queue is no longer available.? for
   any mount point, regardless if that specific mount point is
   involved with the installation path(s) used by ClearCase.  The
   output resembles the following within the EmbeddedExpress logs:
   
   ***   ***   ***   *** ***   ***   ***

   com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.MaintenancePrereqCheckAction,
   err, CWUPI0025E:
   There is insufficient free disk space on the system:
   
   /opt/rational/common/rwp/EmbeddedExpress:
         Required: -1 MB
         Available: -1 MB
   
   /tmp/:
         Required: -1 MB
         Available: -1 MB
   
   Please ensure there is enough free disk space on all required
   filesystems and retry the operation.

   com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPLogSuccessMessageAction,
   msg1, INSTCONFFAILED
   ***   ***   ***   *** ***   ***   ***
   
      NOTE:  The disk space shown is -1 for both ?Required? and
   ?Available?.
   
   
   Workaround:  Clean up all ?stale? mount points that report as ?A
   file, file system or message queue is no longer available.?
   within the ?df -k? output.
