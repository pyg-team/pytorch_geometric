Title: IBM Could Not Load Protocol in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
.app; protocol; 300 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While Rulerunner is processing batches the logs show no other logging except for:

"Error: Application [APT]. Could not load [tmservers/tms:protocol]. Request to obtain Application Service setting failed.InitRoamer: Failed to retrieve information From Application Service. Error:[] InitRoamer: Default value: [300] is used for setting:[tmservers/tms:protocol]" 

SYMPTOM
Even though the Rulerunner logs only show this error message batches are still being processed by Rulerunner.


CAUSE
Less then maximum logging produces this error message.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue open up the .app file and verify that a protocol is set.
For example, it should read "<k name="tms" ip="127.0.0.1" port="2402" protocol="300"/>".
