APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Job Monitor custom columns can partially appear
   unsynchronized according to user actions where custom columns
   are toggled on/off out of list order.  This is most readily seen
   using the Job Monitor for the first time or when cookies have
   been deleted.  One work-around is to enable the very 1st custom
   column, click on Monitor, and then enable/disable columns in any
   arbitrary order.
