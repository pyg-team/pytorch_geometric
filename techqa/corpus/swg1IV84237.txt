APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The current tool used to install server side updates of OS Agent
   Interim Fixes (Application Support Installer) is no longer
   officially supported and implies one or multiple recycles of the
   server where the new supports are being installed (both TEMS
   and TEPS). This can be avoided exploiting the agent SDA feature
   (Self Describing Agents), but OS Agent Interim Fixes are not
   yet capable to support it because they do not package all the
   needed files.

   Problem/Problem Summary: The latest OS agent Interim Fixes have
    recently introduced the self describing support and provide
    this optional method for installing server side updates as an
    alternative to the installation method based on the Application
    Support Installer tool. So far this is only documented in the
    Interim Fix readme file.
