QUESTION
 How to purge all Authorized CIs in DB2 for a test environment where we have already purged all Actual CIs? 

ANSWER
Assuming CIs are not used (in places like in Change records or Service Requests and etc) use the script below to clear the Authorized CI space.

--DB2 only:
alter table maximo.cirelation activate not logged initially with empty table;
alter table maximo.cirelationhis activate not logged initially with empty table;
alter table maximo.cispec activate not logged initially with empty table;
alter table maximo.cispechis activate not logged initially with empty table;
alter table maximo.ci activate not logged initially with empty table; 
alter table maximo.cistatus activate not logged initially with empty table;
delete from maximo.multiassetlocci where cinum is not null;
alter table maximo.ccideletedactci activate not logged initially with empty table;

If use with Service Provider, also issue this command:
delete from maximo.pluspcustassoc where ownertable='CI';
