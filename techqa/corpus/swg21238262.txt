PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installing IBM速 Rational速 products using symbolic links to refer that an installation location, may cause a Microsoft速 Windows速 machine to hang. 

CAUSE
The Java Runtime Environment used to display IBM licensing does not interpret the symbolic link properly, causing the system hang. 

While it is permissible to use UNC pathing to refer an install image or product release area, ie: "\\rational\7.0\install", a UNC path can not be a link to an alternate location.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, avoid using symbolic links to refer to an install image location or release area, when performing a Rational product installation. Only refer to the actual location of the product release area or install area. 

This issue is a reported defect in the Rational installer for Microsoft Windows based products. It is tracked by defect number RATLC00980114.
