QUESTION
 As an Administrator, where can/can't I see users after selecting the various 'Remove' options on a notice's Recipient list? 

CAUSE
Atlas documentation covers what happens from the user's perspective, but as an Administrator, it may be helpful to understand where the user will and won't be visible after selection one of the Remove options.

ANSWER
Remove from Notice: 

- User will be removed from this hold notice
- User will remain on the People In Scope list for this request
- On the Map > Person search, and click the Red L beside their name, Matter will remain listed under 'Legal Holds and Collections'
