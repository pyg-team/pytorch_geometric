ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A customer has reported a problem with the latest Nokia NetAct
   probe when used to connect from one server to many element
   managers.
   The probes all seem to collect data from the first element
   manager connected to.
   
   Patch System ID:
       $ProjectRevision: 1.26.1.9 $
   
   On Solaris.
   
   Example properties;
   
   AlarmIrpName                : 'AlarmIRP'
   NamingServiceIORRequest     : 'GET /cgi-bin/get_nbif_ior'
   NetActServerName            :
   'mi11cor2.r11.netact.vodafoneomnitel.it'
   NetActServerPort            : 10115
   NotificationIrpName         : 'NotificationIRP/FMNotifIRP'
   
   Only the host/port changes between probes, referring to
   different element managers.
   
   They configured the probe as follows, after finding problems
   with using the '0' setting for ORBLocalPort.
   
   probe#1 - 10115 -> EMS1
   probe#1 - 33333 <- EMS1
   
   probe#2 - 10115 -> EMS2
   probe#2 - 44444 <- EMS2
   
   probe#3 - 10115 -> EMS2
   probe#3 - 55555 <- EMS2
   
   But the problem remained.
   
   They are using the GET IOR method, could this cause the problem,
   i.e. a temporary file with the IOR in.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Current Behaviour : If there are        *
   *                      multiple instances of the probe running *
   *                      on same machine and if each one of them *
   *                      is configured to connect to different   *
   *                      element manager. First probe instance   *
   *                      is getting events from the all the      *
   *                      element managers.                       *

   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Required behaviour: Each instance of the probe should get
   events only from the Element Manager for which it is
   configured.
