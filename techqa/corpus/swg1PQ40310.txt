APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using FRCA (FAST RESPONSE CACHE ACCELERATOR) any cached
   documents will no longer require any authentication or
   authorization to retrieve. This means a Client does not even
   require a valid USERID , in the case of " Userid %%CLIENT%% "
   to access the document. Any Browser that accesses the Port the
   WebServer is listening on, has access to FRCA documents.
      So, be certain to protect documents, protected documents are
   NOT cached, as necessary. Our documentation will be updated to
   make this information clear.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the webserver version 5         *
   *                 (release 1 and higher) that use FRCA         *
   *                 caching are affected by this APAR.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The documentation should indicate more  *
   *                      clearly that 1) cached objects are not  *
   *                      secured by a userID and password and    *
   *                      that 2) all secure objects should be    *
   *                      protected in order to prevent their     *
   *                      inclusion in the FRCA cache.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The documentation should indicate more clearly 1) that cached
   objects are not secured by authentication and 2) what objects
   are cache-eligible.  All objects that are loaded into the FRCA
   cache can be openly accessed without requiring authentication.
   In order to prevent objects that require authentication from
   being cached, the user must take steps to verify that those
   objects are configured to be cache-ineligible.  The
   documentation should state this more explicitly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The documentation is changed to clarify the need to protect
   secure documents when the FRCA cache is enabled.

   In each of the following documents:
   IBM HTTP Server for OS/390 Version 5.1, Planning, Installing,
      and Using: Advanced Configuration, Tuning your Web server
      for better performance, Customizing cache management,
      "Using the Fast Response Cache Accelerator"
   http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc51.html [http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc51.html]
   
   IBM HTTP Server for OS/390 Version 5.2, Planning, Installing,
      and Using: Managing your Webserver, Advanced Configuration,
      "Customizing cache management with the Fast Response Cache
      Accelerator"
   http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc52.html [http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc52.html]
   
   IBM HTTP Server for OS/390 Version 5.3, Planning, Installing,
      and Using: Managing your Webserver, Advanced Configuration,
      "Customizing cache management with the Fast Response Cache
      Accelerator"
   http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc53.html [http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/doc53.html]
   
   A) Under the "Overview" header, in the sentence:
   
   "The Fast Response Cache Accelerator can improve the
   performance of the HTTP Server when serving text and image
   files; dynamic content and protected pages are not cached."
   
   Remove the clause: "dynamic content and protected pages are not
   cached." and place a period after "files".
   
   B) Under the "Overview" section and above the "Planning
   Considerations" section, add the following section:
   
   Cache Accelerator Eligibility
   
   Requests for the following objects are not eligible for
   inclusion in the Cache Accelerator:
   
   - dynamically-generated content
   - objects with associated meta data (as configured in the
      MetaDir and MetaSuffix directives)
   - objects generated with SSI
   - proxy requests
   - objects served over SSL connections
   - objects specified by the FRCANoCache (or not specified by
      FRCACacheOnly) directives
   
   Other special cases include the following:
   - Objects that are protected using the Protect directive are not
      eligible for loading into the Cache Accelerator unless the
      mask used is a predefined generic group, such as "Users, All,
      Anybody, Anyone, Anonymous", or '*'.
   - When virtual hosting support is enabled, client requests that
      omit the hostname header are not eligible for loading into
      the Cache Accelerator.
   - When the UseACLs directive is configured to "always", then no
      objects will be loaded into the Cache Accelerator.
   
   Once an object is loaded into the Cache Accelerator, it is
   openly accessible without requiring authentication.  As such,
   the user should explicitly configure the webserver (as shown
   above) to prevent objects that require authentication from being
   loaded into the Cache Accelerator.
   
   (Example: While configuring the UserID directive to %%CLIENT%%
   causes the webserver to require user authentication on the
   initial request, its use does not affect the Cache Accelerator
   eligibility of that request.  Hence, the request could still be
   cached following the initial request.  From that point on, the
   request would no longer require authentication for access on
   subsequent requests.)
