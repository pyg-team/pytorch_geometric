APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The KFWHISTDATA table on the TEPS DB can be converted to the
   WAREHOUSESUMPRUNE table in the Warehouse DB, based on the level
   of the Summarization and Pruning agent.  This will cause the
   migrate-export to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Since the KFWHISTDATA table is renamed to KFWHISTDATABAK after
   the conversion to WAREHOUSESUMPRUNE, the references in
   export.parms can be changed from KFWHISTDATA to KFWHISTDATABAK.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After KFWHISTDATA conversion, migrate-export fails.
   
   
   The KFWHISTDATA table in the portal server database can be
   converted to the WAREHOUSESUMPRUNE table in the warehouse
   database based on the level of the Summarization and Pruning
   agent. This will cause the migrate-export to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The behavior has been changed to have KFWHISTDATA as an optional
   table so the migrate-export will not fail when it does not
   exist.
