APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MultipartRequest.java creates temp files in method
   processFile(). These temp files are not properly cleaned up when
    they are needed no longer. Therefore they can accumulate in the
    OS temp directory and cause performance issues over time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  manual delete files in temp folder
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In the temp folder of the operating system the number of temp
   files are increasing over time, which causes performance issues
   with coaches.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   When processing HTTP requests coming from coaches the
   processing of the HTTP requests results in temp files in the
   temp folder of the operating system, which are not cleaned up
   properly in call situations. So the number of temp files in the
   temp folder is increasing over time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this interim fix all temp files that are created in the
   context of processing HTTP requests are cleaned up when the
   HTTP request is processed and the garbage collector is cleaning
   up the corresponding Java object instances.
