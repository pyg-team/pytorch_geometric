PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I run a Content Scan Job, no pages are scanned and upon examining the traffic log, only a HEAD request to the starting URL is present. 

SYMPTOM
The scan job does not find any pages, only a HEAD request to the starting URL is in the traffic log.


CAUSE
There is a domain defined with a regular expression that matches the domain you are scanning

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the product, go to the Administration tab and bring up the list of Servers and Domains. Ensure that there is not a domain defined with a regular expression that matches the domain you are scanning.


For example, if you are scanning: 

www12.domain.com 

and you see a domain defined as: 

"regexp:www[0-9]?[0-9]?\.domain.com" 

remove this entry from the list. 

If the regular expression in the list is matched first, than subsequent matched domains are seen as 'external' and only have HEAD requests sent to them.
