ABSTRACT
 System Requirements for IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack 4.0 

CONTENT
IBM has provided a Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool where you can locate and find complete lists of supported operating systems, system requirements, prerequisites, and optional supported software for IBM Integration Bus versions, including IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack 4.0. 

The SPCR tool links to information about the minimum product levels that must be installed before opening a problem report with IBM Integration Bus Technical Support. The software versions and any maintenance levels listed in the tool have been explicitly verified as working. 

Please refer to the IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack README [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] for the latest information.
