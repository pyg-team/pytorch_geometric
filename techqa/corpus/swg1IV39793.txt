APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is possible to cause ITM Dashboard Data Provider or eWAS to
   hang if too many parallel accesses are made to OS agent resource
   bundles.  Java messages indicate issue is in hashmap code. Note
   that the Windows, Unix and Linux OS agent bundles were
   corrected.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  It is possible to get ITM Data Provider into a hang when too
   many parallel accesses are made to OS agent resource bundles.
   
   
   It is possible to get ITM Data Provider into a hang when too
   many parallel accesses are made to OS agent resource bundles.
   When too many parallel accesses are made to OS agent resource
   bundles a hanging stack like the following is produced:
   at
   java/util/HashMap.findNonNullKeyEntry(HashMap.java:528(Compiled
   Code))
   4XESTACKTRACE at
   java/util/HashMap.putImpl(HashMap.java:624(Compiled Code))
   4XESTACKTRACE at java/util/HashMap.put(HashMap.java:607(Compiled
   Code))
   4XESTACKTRACE at
   candle/knt/resources/DocKntBundle.loadMap(DocKntBundle.java:7608
   )
   4XESTACKTRACE at
   candle/knt/resources/DocKntBundle.handleGetObject(DocKntBundle.j
   ava:7586)
   4XESTACKTRACE at
   java/util/ResourceBundle.getObject(ResourceBundle.java:409(Compi
   led Code))
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added synchronization objects to make OS agents java code for
   resource bundles thread safe.  Note that all of the OS agents,
   including the remote OS agents, were updated.
