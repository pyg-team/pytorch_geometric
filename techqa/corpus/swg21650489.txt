PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using the Export -> Other-> ITCAM for Transaction option exports the script, but it does not export the runtime. 

CAUSE
The extensions needed for the runtime export are not installed on the RPT workbench

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for Transactions does not support RPT 8.5. To verify any RPT version compatibility, see the Related URLs for the Support Matrix.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the RPT options installed for the RPT workbench by viewing IBM Installation Manager, the Modify option.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM





 * If you installed the RPT version supplied with ITCAM for Transactions, use IBM Installation Manager to Modify the options you have installed if they do not match the packages below.
   
 * ITCAM for Transactions 7.4.0.1 currently supports the RPT 8.6 32bit architecture. If you have installed RPT 8.6 or RPT 9.0 64bit architecture, this is not supported. Remove this installation and then install the 32bit version.
   Verify the architecture through IBM Installation Manager. Click on Update and select IBM Software Delivery Platform. Check the Architecture value.
