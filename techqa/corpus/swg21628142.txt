Title: IBM Unable to import or export deployments - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Importing any applications, macros and admin links fail with an error. When exporting any applications (model only and model & data), macros and admin links, the export hangs at 5% and does not complete. This has to be manually deleted. 

SYMPTOM
The following error occurs when importing any deployment packages:

"There is nothing to display from this scan - please select another location."

When clicking OK on the above error message, the following error then appears:

"There was a problem running the Deployment Wizard: null"

When exporting any objects, the progress of the deployment gets stuck at 5%. This needs to be manually deleted so no errors are recorded for this (even when the deployment hangs).


CAUSE
IBM Cognos 8 and IBM Planning Services running under localhost and not a domain account

ENVIRONMENT
Single server planning installation 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
- Got a copy of a deployment package to see if I could reproduce in-house which I could not
- Asked customer to create a new dummy Planning Store to see whether deployments worked, it did not

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Changed the IBM Cognos 8 and IBM Cognos Planning Services to run under a domain account. As it was a single server installation, the services were set to 'Localhost'. Changing this to a domain account resolved the issue.
