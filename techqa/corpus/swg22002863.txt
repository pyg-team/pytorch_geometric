Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2016-7055, CVE-2017-3731) - United States

Text:
CVE-2016-7055; CVE-2017-3731 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 26, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Rational ClearCase. IBM Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions:



Version Status 9.0.1, 9.0.1.1 Not Affected 9.0 through 9.0.0.4 Affected 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.14 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Affected 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.19 (all fix packs) Affected 
Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: 
 1. You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    
 2. You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
    
 3. On UNIX/Linux clients, you use the Change Management Integration (CMI) when configured to use SSL to communicate with the server (ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert (RTC) or Jira).
    Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
    
 4. You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply a fix pack as listed in the table below. The fix pack includes OpenSSL 1.0.2k. 

Affected Versions Applying the fix 9.0 through 9.0.0.4 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 5 (9.0.0.5) for 9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043920] or Rational ClearCase release 9.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043585] 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.14
