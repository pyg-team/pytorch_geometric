You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upon 1st SAVE throws out error prompt ""BMXAA2278E - You do not
   have
   authorization for Locations (SP) applications.""
   2nd SAVE attempt successful with no error prompts.
   This seems to be a defect with Maximo Security Configuration
   Settings
   (Product Defect).
   Following is the way to replicate it:
   1. User Group should have access to Storeroom Application
   2. User Group should NOT have access to Locations (SP)
   application
   (Add, Modify, Delete and Save)
   Now when the user belonging to the User Group, tries to create a
   Storeroom in Storeroom Application, User gets the above
   mentioned error
   message. However, Maximo saves the records behind the scenes.
   The error
   message should not be prompted to the user.
