Title: IBM Customizing Quickr to use HTTP/HTTPS in links in Newsletter - United States

Text:
Quickr NewsLetter URL; http; https; ssl; links TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
By default, QuickrÂ® generates the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) links in the NewsLetter by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The links will not work if the server is set up with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled; in this case HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) is required.

ANSWER
There are two notes.ini variables that can be used to affect the URLs that Lotus Quickr generates in the Newsletters:
Option 1:
h_EmailUrlPrefix="xxxx"
"xxxx" is what will be used as "HTTP" or "HTTPS" in URLs generated

Notes:
1. There is no check in Quickr to verify the value; whatever is entered is what will be generated.
2. This setting takes precedence over the QuickPlaceSSL setting.

Option 2:
QuickPlaceSSL=0|1
0 (or not set) will generate "HTTP"
1 will generate "HTTPS"
