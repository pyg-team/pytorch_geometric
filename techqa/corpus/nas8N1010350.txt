Title: IBM Supported Management Consoles for Flex Power Nodes - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Flex nodes can be managed by HMC, IVM or FSM. Only one manager type can be active; dual management by FSM and HMC is not supported.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Flex POWER nodes are supported as stand-alone (no Management Console) or with any of the following Management Consoles: IVM, HMC, or FSM.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010350&amp;aid=1] AIX Linux IBM i Stand-alone (see Note 1) y y n (see Note 2) IVM (see Note 1) y y y HMC (see Note 1) y y y FSM y y y Notes: 
1. If a FSM manages the chassis, it must manage all POWER nodes in the chassis. Dual management with FSM is not supported. 
2. IBM i requires VIOS and one of the supported MCs. 

HMC Support for Flex 
Announcement 
http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS113-125 [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS113-125] 

FSM-HMC Conversion Requirements 
o FSM 1.3.0 and 1.3.1: HMC Version 7 Release 7.7.0 Service pack 2 (7.7.7.0.2) or a later service pack or release. 
o FSM 1.3.2 or later: HMC Version 7 Release 7.9.0 or later. 

Power Firmware requirements 
Firmware 01AF773_033; 01AF773_056 or higher is recommended (see Note below following table). 

Supported Combinations [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010350&amp;aid=1] 01AF773_033 01AF773_051 to 058 01AF783_021 and later Version 7 Release 7.7.0 Service Pack 2 or later Service Pack 3 or later Not supported Version 7 Release 7.8.0 Not supported. Supported (see Note) Not supported Version 7 Release 7.9.0 and later Not supported. Not supported. *Supported Note: All power nodes at EC level 01AF773 managed by FSM 1.3.1 or earlier must either be powered off or concurrently updated to 773.12 (AF773_056) or later prior to the conversion to HMC V7R7.8 or later. Failure to comply may result in the node going to an incomplete state after the HMC connects. The HMC will not be able to work with or manage the node or any virtual servers.

HMC Restrictions o Dual management with FSM is not supported. o The FSM cannot manage any chassis that contains HMC-managed POWER nodes. o Conversion of existing nodes from FSM to HMC is supported. o Conversion of existing nodes from HMC back to FSM is not supported. The partition configuration must be initialized and re-created. o HMC support for TLS 1.2 enablement requires 7.7.7.0.4+MH01482, 7.7.8.0.2+MH01432, 7.7.9.0.1+MH01484, 8.8.1.0.1, 8.8.2.0.0+MH01486 or later; or Version 8 HMC with security mode set to nist_sp800_131a. 
Preparation 1. Back up profile data.

Back up the partition configuration on each node managed by the FSM. To back up the partition data to USERID's home directory, run the following:
lssyscfg -r sys -F type_model*serial_num | while read machine; do bkprofdata -m "$machine" -f /home/USERID/"$machine"BeforeHMC$(date +%Y%m%d) ; done

Copy all files, including subdirectories, to removable media or scp/ftp the files to the HMC or another server. The FSM and HMC both allow scp command in restricted shell. FTP can be done from FSM to another server using the sendfile command. See "man sendfile" for more information. 2. Verify FSM, HMC, and POWER node firmware levels. 3. Validate HMC-Flex networking.

a. Verify HMC can reach the node management interface. 
The HMC manages the node over its FSP ipv4 or ipv6 address. 

To determine the configured node IP addresses, use either of the following:
o CMM: Chassis Management > Component IP Configuration
o ASM: Network Services > Network Configuration

To view the current address used by FSM: 
FSM: lssysconn -r all 

Verify the HMC can ping each node's IP address.
Verify that any external firewall allows TCP port 30000, 30001, 443.

b. Verify HMC can reach each partition's RMC interface.
The HMC requires a RMC connection to each Linux/VIOS/AIX partition on the node to perform advanced tasks such as dynamic partitioning and PowerVM configuration.

To view the existing IP addresses used by the FSM for RMC, run the FSM command:
lspartition -all

On the HMC, verify the HMC can ping each IP address.
Verify that any external firewall allows TCP and UDP port 657 from the partition to HMC and HMC to partition. 4. Validate CMM passwords.

Determine which chassis are centrally managed. Run the command:
smcli lsCentrallyManagedChassis

If the chassis is not returned, it is decentralized management. Log in to CMM using the USERID account to verify the password is known.

For centrally managed chassis, consider using the following procedure if the original password is in doubt:
a. Log into CMM using the FSM user account.
b. Create a new CMM ID with supervisor authority.
c. Convert to decentralized management. 
Run the command smcli rmCentrallyManagedChassis -u xxxxx where xxxx = uuid of the chassis returned previously.
d. Verify you can log into CMM using USERID; use the new ID to reset, if needed.
e. When the rmCentrallyManagedChassis command completes, the chassis is still managed. The chassis no longer uses the management node user registry, so when the command completes, you must request access to the chassis again, with the chassis credentials instead of the FSM credentials. 5. Use FSM to un-manage the chassis.

To Unmanage the chassis, see the Information Center section "Remove a Chassis": http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/flexsys/information/topic/com.ibm.acc.8731.doc/adding_or_removing_a_chassis.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/flexsys/information/topic/com.ibm.acc.8731.doc/adding_or_removing_a_chassis.html] 6. Power off and remove the FSM node.

If the FSM is installed in the same chassis, the FSM node should be powered off and removed to prevent rediscovery of the chassis and nodes. 7. Add the POWER node to the HMC(s).

Use "Add Managed System" (mksysconn command) to add each POWER node to the HMC(s). 

The password field requires the Flex Node's USERID password. The node authenticates against its LDAP server which, by default for an unmanaged chassis, is the CMM USERID password. If the CMM is configured to use an external LDAP server, the server must have an account of USERID. 

Add the power node to a second HMC, if desired. Dual HMCs are supported; both HMCs must be at the same version and release. 8. Configure CMM callhome.

While the HMC will display service events for nodes, it will not act as a callhome server. If the FSM was used previously for service and support call home, then configure the CMM as the new call home server. For information on configuring CMM, refer to the following URL:http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/flexsys/information/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.acc.cmm.doc%2Fcmm_callhome_site_prep.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/flexsys/information/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.acc.cmm.doc%2Fcmm_callhome_site_prep.html] 
IVM Requirements 

o VIOS 2.2.2.3 
o Conversion from HMC or FSM to IVM is not supported. The partition configuration must be cleared and re-created.
