   Problem Summary: Multiple Channel Stopped rows returned in
   'MQSeries Events' workspace (current events attribute group) for
   the same channel with the exact same data.  Problem Description:
   There is currently processing in place to compare new event with
   existing current events and bypass addition of new event if all
   data reported in the event is the same.  However, this checking
   was bypassed in some cases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code was changed to make the channel stopped event will go
   through the checking of current events for a  redundant
   entry.
