Title: IBM Messaging Engine fails to start - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Messaging Engine failed to start with the following error messages in the logs:

CWSIS0002E: The messaging engine encountered an exception while starting. Exception: com.ibm.ws.sib.msgstore.PersistenceException:
CWSIS1501E: The data source has produced an unexpected exception:
com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.SqlException: DB2 SQL error: SQLCODE: -552, SQLSTATE:
42502, SQLERRMC: WPSADMIN;CREATE SCHEMA...

CWSID0035E: Messaging engine XYZ cannot be started; detected error reported during com.ibm.ws.sib.msgstore.impl.MessageStoreImpl start()
00000028 SibMessage CWSID0027E: Messaging engine XYZ cannot be restarted because a serious error has been reported. 

CAUSE
The messaging engine will not start because it is being asked to create its schema and tables in the database and is being refused due to a permission violation by the database.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The schema in the database is needed by the messaging engines to store persistent messages and state information. It is created when the messaging engine is created. A messaging engine gets created when an application server or cluster is added to the bus. 

If you want the messaging engine to create its own schema and tables you must grant the permission described on the following page:
Database privileges [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rjm0650_.html]

You can also manually create the schema and tables if you like. Use the below instructions to manually create the schema and tables:
Creating the database, schema and user ID for a messaging engine [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tjm0030_.html]

If your policy is to limit privileges, you will need to use a manual process to get the messaging engine data stores set up correctly.
