PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to tell which HTTPS default protocol is being used in Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Launcher Agent. 

CAUSE
General question on how to find out if SSL or TLS protocol is being used by HTTPS in WTX Launcher Agent.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
General question. No diagnosis of a problem.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Launcher Agent, the HTTP/S adapter and the FTP/S adapter all default to using both SSL and TLS security protocols. When the "mercssl" module is in use, TLS 1.1, 1.0, SSLv3, and the SSLv2 protocols will be negotiated, starting from TLS 1.1 and proceeding downward until a compatible SSL/TLS protocol is found with the other connecting peer. 

When the the IBM GSKit has been installed and found within the executable path of the WTX runtime environment, the "m4gskssl" module will negotiate from the TLS 1.2 protocol down through the remaining protocols until a compatible SSL/TLS connection is made with the connecting peer. By using the secure mode option in the dtx.ini file, additional NIST-based security can be enforced. 

To examine what SSL/TLS protocol was negotiated, the HTTPS adapter verbose (-TV) trace option can be temporarily activated for informational purposes. Trace file name is not unique, and will force single threading when kept enabled. 

In order to get a verbose trace without re-compiling a map, the M4HTTP_OPT/M4FTP_OPT environment setting can be set or the m4http.ini/m4ftp.ini file included in a specific map directory or WTX installation location. Following link provides additional information on this environment variable:

For the INI setting to work, set the WTX_ADAPTER_FILE_CMD_OPTION_ENABLE to any value. 

Through this method, INI file checking will always occur whenever an INI file is used or if the M4HTTP_OPT/M4FTP_OPT setting points to a file via the @ option. 

If a proxy server is being used, then the proxy server will make the connection to the target HTTP/S Server as well as negotiate the SSL protocol. Therefore, consult proxy software on how to determine further SSL connectivity details. 

There is an SSL tunneling option, -tunneling, that could make the connection to the proxy an SSL connection. However, that option depends on the proxy configuration. The following link supplies additional information regarding the -tunneling option:
