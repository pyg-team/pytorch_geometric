PROBLEM
When logging into the IBM WebSphere Application Server console via a browser, the original wasadmin user cannot see the IBM Sametime System Console information / option at the bottom of the left pane.

CAUSE
This problem is usually caused by a role mapping issue in the WebSphere Application Server deployment manager (Dmgr).
On the Dmgr Console page --> Users and Groups --> Administrative User Roles, the wasadmin user is typically listed twice, once as the "Role: Primary administrative Username" and the second time as "Role: All Authenticated Users." 

If the wasadmin does not have the role of All Authenticated Users, this is why he/she cannot see the Sametime System Console settings at the bottom of the page.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To fix the problem: 


1. In the Sametime System Console, open a command prompt and enter the following:


 * C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\STSCAppProfile\bin>wsadmin -lang jython
 * 

2. Type the wasadmin user name and password when prompted. 

3. When you get a command prompt, type the following:  * 
 * wsadmin>AdminTask.mapUsersToAdminRole('[-userids ["wasadmin"] -roleName "All Authenticated Users"]')
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

4. Then type wsadmin>AdminConfig.save(). 

5. Once complete, restart the deployment manager, node, and SSC. 

The wasadmin user should now be able to see the Sametime System Console options when logging out and back into the console.
