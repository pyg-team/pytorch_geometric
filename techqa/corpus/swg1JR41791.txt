APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is an important section missing in the
   infocenter/adapter-documentation namely the installation and
   configuration of the adapter in a clustered environment.
   
   We found a section called "Installing the RAR file" but this is
   only valid for stand-alone WAS/WPS environments.
   
   Neither in the infocenter nor in the adapter documentation
   do you find a corresponding section that explains how to install
   and configure the adpater in a Network Deployed environment.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following guide exists for 6.2, but this type of information
   should be available in the infocenter for clustered installs:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There is an important section missing in the
   infocenter/adapter-documentation namely the installation and
   configuration of the adapter in a clustered environment.
   We found a section called "Installing the RAR file" but this is
   only valid for stand-alone WAS/WPS environments.
   Neither in the infocenter nor in the adapter documentation
   a corresponding section that explains how to install
   and configure the adpater in a Network Deployed environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We have added the link of deploying and configuring  WebSphere
   Adapters in a clustered environment  in the clustered
   deployment.
   
   To deploy and configure WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files in a
   clustered environment, see the following link:
