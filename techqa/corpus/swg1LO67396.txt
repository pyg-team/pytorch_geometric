ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error DescriptionÏ
   
   
   In a form with tabs, each containing a computed text field,
   displayed in read mode, the value of the computed field
   disappears when print preview is selected after switching tabs,
   both from print preview, and from the form display after the
   print preview is dismissed.
   
   Steps to reproduce.
   
   Install the test db, which has a form with tabbed table,
   fields, and computed text as follows.
     First tab
       Choose a value - Field name "Untitled" - editable checkbox
       Value chosen - Computed Text - @Implode( Untitled; @NewLine)
     Second tab
       likewise, except the field name is Untitled_1.
   
   1. Compose new document (using New View button) and choose
   values from checkboxes in both tabs.
   2. Save & Close the document.
   3. Open the new document (last in view) in read-mode.
   4. Click the Print button and print-preview the form.
   Everything looks fine.  Close print dialog (Done, Cancel)
   5. Now click the 2nd tab and click the Print button again and
   go to print-preview.
   6. Note how the computed text (in Value chosen) has disappeared.
   7. Close the print dialog.  Note how the computed text has now
   disappeared from the on-screen form display as well.
   
   This problem is observed in read-mode, not edit mode.
   The text can be restored for read mode by switching to edit
   mode and back, e.g., control-E twice.
   
   This problem has been reproduced on 8.5.3 (Win 2003), and
   reported by customer on 7.0.4 (XP)  and 8.5.1FP3 (Windows 7)
