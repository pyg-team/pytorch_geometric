QUESTION
 Why am I not able to copy and paste text from Maximo when using Internet Explorer? 

ANSWER
In Maximo 7.5 the Rich Text copy/paste controls are not working because of workstation 
security settings. The controls highlight text and look like they work, for copy but when 
you copy or paste, nothing happens and what was previously in the 
clipboard is still there, ie if you were to paste from MAXIMO to WORD, 
you wouldn't get what you copied, but something from a previous copy. 

This is part of security with Internet Explorer and the clipboard. To have them work 
properly, the user has to take the following steps: 

1) In Internet Explorer, select Internet Options under the Tools menu 
option. 
2) Go to the Security Tab and click on the Trusted Sites icon 
3) The Sites button should now be enabled, click that to open the 
Trusted Sites dialog box. 
4) Add the Maximo address/url to the list of websites to be trusted. 
5) Click Close and then OK on the previous dialog. 
6) The next time you are in Maximo, the first time that you click on one
of the Copy/Cut/Paste icons, Internet Explorer will tell you that the 
webpage is requesting access to clipboard and do you want to allow 
it. Click the 'Allow Access' button to give Maximo access. The buttons
will now work properly.
