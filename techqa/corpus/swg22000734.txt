Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in GSKit affects IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft Windows (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 An OpenSSL vulnerability disclosed by the OpenSSL Project affects GSKit. IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft Windows uses GSKit and therefore is also vulnerable. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft Windows 4.7.0.0 through 4.7.0.4_iFix027

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable DES/3DES cipher suites and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling DES/3DES cipher suites. You should verify disabling DES/3DES cipher suites does not cause any compatibility issues.

Apply and enable the following fix when you cannot disable DES/3DES cipher suites in your environment. 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft Windows 4.7.0 IT19772 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT19772] Apply 4.7.0.5, available on Fix Central [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Other%20software&product=ibm/Other+software/Sterling+Connect%3ADirect+for+Microsoft+Windows&release=4.7.0.5&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=IT19772] 
The fix adds the ability to engage a GSKit remediation for this vulnerability via a system environment variable named CD_GSK_OPTIONS. To enable the remediation, set the value of this system environment variable to GSK_ENFORCE_TDEA_RESTRICTION. Than cycle (stop and restart) Sterling Connect:Direct. 
Caution: The effect of this remediation is to arbitrarily break a session after 32 GB of data have been transmitted. 

In addition to the GSKit remediation, CD Secure+ Admin Tool (SPAdmin) and CD Secure+ CLI (SPCli) have been enhanced to display warnings when deprecated cipher suites or protocols have been configured, which includes all cipher suites using an RC4, DES/3DES or no encryption algorithm and the SSLv3 protocol at this time. 
Note: Deprecated cipher suites and protocols may be disabled in a future update. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable DES/3DES cipher suites.
