DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
 

IBM Content Navigator is a web client that provides users with a web interface for working with content from multiple content servers. It helps companies provide managed access to large volumes of electronic data. IBM Content Navigator enables users to search for and work with documents that are stored in content servers that are located around the world from a web browser. IBM Content Navigator works with the following desktop clients:


 * IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office - an optional component of IBM Content Navigator that enables users to access content from within Microsoft Office applications. 
 * IBM Content Navigator Sync Client - an optional component of IBM Content Navigator that enables users to sync content between their workstation and the web client (Available only on FileNet P8 systems). 
 * IBM Content Navigator Edit Service - an optional component of IBM Content Navigator that enables users to easily add files or edit files in the native applications installed on their computers (Available only on FileNet P8 systems).


In addition, IBM Content Navigator Version 3.0.1 also distributes Microsoft SharePoint Web Parts for the Browse, Search, and Work features. The Web Parts enable users to access documents stored in an IBM FileNet P8 repository from Microsoft SharePoint. 

The IBM Content Navigator software package also includes the following applications: 
 * IBM CMIS for Content Manager 
 * IBM CMIS for Content Manager OnDemand 
 * IBM CMIS for FileNet Content Manager 
 * IBM FileNet Collaboration Services


SPACE REQUIREMENTS
On the application server, IBM Content Navigator will require a minimum of:


 * Disk space:  * For a standalone configuration: 4 GB on the drive on which you plan to install IBM Content Navigator. 
    * For a cluster configuration: 6 GB on the drive on which you plan to install IBM Content Navigator.
   
   
 * Temp space: The self-extractor checks for free disk space that is three times the size of the installer where the temp directory is located. For instance if the installer is 1.3GB, and the temp directory is set to C:\temp, the installers will look for 4GB of free space on the C: drive.  * On Windows, If enough free space is not available, the installer will prompt the user for an alternate location for extraction. 
    * On Unix, the installer does not prompt to pick another location; however the IATEMPDIR environment variable may be manually set to a location with sufficient temp space. To set the variable enter one of the following commands at the UNIX command line prompt before running this installer again:
      - for Bourne shell (sh), ksh, bash and zsh:
      $ IATEMPDIR=/your/free/space/directory
      $ export IATEMPDIR
      - for C shell (csh) and tcsh:
      $ setenv IATEMPDIR /your/free/space/directory
   
   
 * JVM Memory: 1 GB
