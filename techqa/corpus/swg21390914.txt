PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How does one get a listing or schema of all the tables in octigate? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There's no built-in schema tool available to get a listing of the Octigate tables and their relationship hierarchies. You'll have to use one of the many tools available on the Internet to create a schema listing of the octigate database. One of the common ones I've seen used is SchemaSpy available here:
http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/] 

The ITCAM octigate database consists of 66 tables (as of 6.1.0.4 release). Here's a listing of all the tables in the database if you want to use your own SQL queries against the database.
