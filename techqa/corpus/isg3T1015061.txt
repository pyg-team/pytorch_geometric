PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Question about executing a command upon 'bkill' 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
I got the following request from a vendor:

"configure an LSF queue so that it will be calling the
'$VMANAGER_HOME/bin/vm_lsf_post_exec.sh' script
upon bkill command execution."

So would I want to create a queue with the following attribute?

JOB_CONTROLS=TERMINATE[$VMANAGER_HOME/bin/vm_lsf_post_exec.sh]
(I'll substitute the real path for $VMANAGER_HOME) If you want not to kill the job then use the definition you mentioned:
JOB_CONTROLS=TERMINATE[$VMANAGER_HOME/bin/vm_lsf_post_exec.sh]

Note that this means everytime you do bkill on a job in this queue, it will only run this script and not actually try to kill the job itself.
