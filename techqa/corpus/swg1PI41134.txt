APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed Statistics 23.0 or 22.0 on Mac OS 10.10.
   Yosemite.  The
   installation went without error and now you try to license the
   product with the License Authorization Wizard (LAW).  Your
   attempt fails with "You do not have the correct administrator
   privileges to license this product' "message.
   
   You know you are executing as an Administrator user, so that is
   not  the problem.  You open a Terminal and examine the directory
   and file permissions on the installation path.  You note that
   several subdirectories are owned by 'root' with group membership
   for the 'wheel' group.  You change the directory group
   membership recursively:
   
   cd /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/
   sudo chown -R root:admin 23
   
   Note: for release 22 use:
   cd /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/
   sudo chown -R root:admin 22
   
   With the group ownership changed, your attempt to use the LAW
   now succeeds.

 *  This issue will be addressed in a future release.
