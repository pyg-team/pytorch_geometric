APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Group membership for users is currently refreshed upon logging
   in to the Process Portal. In certain scenarios, it is necessary
   to update group membership triggered by a script or
   administrative task to avoid time consuming refresh operations
   upon login. This interim fix provides such scripts and
   administrative tasks.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Provide scripts and administrative tasks to manually trigger
   group membership refresh
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   During login into the portal, group membership that is stored in
   the WebSphere Application Server's User Registry is updated for
   the user that logs. If a change is detected, this change is
   reflected in the database and relevant participant groups. Task
   specific or participant group specific expressions, so called
   dynamic groups, might also be affected by this change in the
   group membership. Therefore, all dynamic groups are updated to
   reflect the correct membership and authorization. In certain
   scenario or if there are many dynamic groups in the system, the
   login into the portal might take very long.
   
   To get around this performance issue, there are two
   administrative actions to execute:
   I. Disable refresh of dynamic groups during login.
   1. Locate the configuration file 100Custom.xml in your server /
   cluster environment and add this configuration option:
      <server merge="mergeChildren">
        <update-dynamic-groups-on-login>false
        </update-dynamic-groups-on-login>
      </server>
   2. Synchronize all nodes so the updated configuration is
   applied to all servers.
   3. Restart the server / cluster members to allow them to pick
   up the updated configuration.
   4. You can verify the correct configuration by inspecting the
   file TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml in your profile's
   config directory.
   
   II. Execute the administrative script groupMembershipFullUpdate
   that is provided by this interim fix to update group membership
   and dynamic groups by an administrator.
   This interim fix provides four new administrative scripts
   and AdminTasks for usage by wsadmin which were originally
   introduced in version 8.5:
   
   groupMembershipFullUpdate [options]
   Updates the User Registry group membership of all users that
   are known to BPM. At the end of the group membership update,
   dynamic groups are updated once if at least one group
   membership update was detected.
   
   groupMembershipUpdate [options] <userID1> <userID2> ...
   <userIDn>
   Updates the User Registry group membership of the users passed
   with this command. If an user ID is passed that is unknown to
   BPM, this users is created within BPM. At the end of the group
   membership update, dynamic groups are updated once if at least
   one group membership update was detected.
   
   usersFullSync [options]
   Synchronizes all users available from the User Registry. No
   group membership is updated. This admin task is equivalent to
   the "Full Synchronize" command in the Process Admin Console.
   
   usersSync [options] <userID1> <userID2> ... <userIDn>
   Synchronizes the passed users from LDAP. No group membership is
   updated. This admin task is equivalent to the "Synchronize"
   command in the Process Admin Console.
   
   Options:
     -username <username> -password <password> -host
       <server host name> -port <server SOAP port number>
   
   Usage sample on a node running a windows version of Business
   Process Manager:
   1. switch to <profile>\bin and execute setupCmdLine.bat
   2  stay in directory <profile>\bin and execute
     <install>\BPM\Lombardi\tools\security\
      groupMembershipFullUpdate.bat
   
   For other scripts and other platforms, execute similar steps
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The administrative scripts and tasks allow you to synchronize
   users and group membership when necessary.
