APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Decision Center Business Console, in the Decision
   Artifacts tab, the download doesn't work when the DT name is in
   Japanese and the DT is being displayed
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Two workaround are available if you need to download the DT as
   an Excel file:
   1) rename your DT (or make a copy of your DT for the dowload
   purpose) so that it gets an English name
   => the Download of the decision tables as an Excel will work
   2) instead of opening the DT and clicking on the download
   button, open the package where the DT is listed, and select the
   one you want to download with the checkbox for that.
   The "Download the Selected decision tables as an Excel" will
   work when you are not editing the DT but listing the list of
   artifacts in this package.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue occurs because of encoding error in Decision Table
   name when exporting to Excel with Japanese.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
