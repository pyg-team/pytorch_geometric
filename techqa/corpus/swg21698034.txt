Title: IBM Images not appearing in IBM Cognos BI reports - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Report images might not appear in IBM Cognos Business Intelligence reports if the images are stored on an SSL-enabled web server.

The images might appear in HTML output, but not in PDF, Excel or Active Reports. This applies to all output that embeds the image. 

CAUSE
The issue can occur when SSL is enabled on your web server and you have not imported the web server CA certificate into the IBM Cognos BI trust store. 

Additionally, if your web server has client SSL authentication set to optional or required, then this issue can occur if you have not also imported the CA certificate used to enable internal SSL for IBM Cognos BI into the web server's trust store.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue: 

 1. Import the CA certificate that is used to enable SSL for the web server into the IBM Cognos BI trust store.
    
    For more information about importing certificates into the IBM Cognos BI trust store, see the following page: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695524 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695524].
    
    
 2. If client SSL authentication is set to optional or required for your web server, import the CA certificate that is used to enable internal SSL for IBM Cognos BI into the web server's trust store. 
    
    You export the CA certificate that is used to enable internal SSL for IBM Cognos BI by using the ThirdPartyCertificateTool.
    
    Use the following commands to export the CA certificate from the Cognos BI trust store: 
 3. In version Cognos Analytics 11.x, on UNIX® or LINUX®, type
    ThirdPartyCertificateTool.sh -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -p password
    
    In version 10.2.2, on UNIX® or LINUX®, type
    ThirdPartyCertificateTool.sh -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -p password
    
    In version 10.2.0 and 10.2.1, on UNIX® or LINUX®, type
    ThirdPartyCertificateTool.sh -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -D ../configuration/signkeypair -p password
     * In version 11.x on Windows®, type
       ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -p password
    
    

 *  In version 10.2.2, on Windows®, type
   ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -p password
   
   In version 10.2.0 and 10.2.1, on Windows®, type
   ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -E -T -r exported_CA_certificate_fileName -D ../configuration/signkeypair -p password
   
   Note: The password should have already been set. If not, the default password is NoPassWordSet.
