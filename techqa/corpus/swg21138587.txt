 6. Collect the following:
    *Please collect data for a single OOM event on a single server unless otherwise instructed.*  * heapdump*.phd 
     * javacore*.txt 
     * Snap*.trc 
     * server.xml file for the server experiencing the OutOfMemory exception. 
     * V8.0.0.2 and above (optional): A system core file is generated with OOMs on Java 6 R26 and above. Please collect the respective core*.dmp file(s) if requested by IBM Support. 
     * All files located in the following directory:  * For WebSphere Application Server V6.0 to V8.0:  * AIX or Linux:
             profile_root/logs/server_name
             
             
           * Windows:
             profile_root\logs\server_name
             
             
          
          
        * For WebSphere Application Server V5.1:  * AIX or Linux:
