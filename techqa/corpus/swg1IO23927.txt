APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The only problem here is that for each user, Datacap Navigator
   stores a setting in the ICN database. When user logins as xyz, a
   record is created for user settings and when the same user logs
   in as XYZ, another record is created. We should not have this
   behaviour because
   for each case, we can have different settings, which is not
   logical.

   lowercase. so the user "xyz" will have same usersetting with
   "XYZ" or "xYZ".
