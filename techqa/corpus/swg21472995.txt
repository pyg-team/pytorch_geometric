PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer-provided background information (also known as "MustGather" data) helps in problem determination and saves time when resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). This technote provides a description of the background information IBM® Support will need to diagnose CSS related problems. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

 * 2. Collecting data [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg21472995]- selected tab,




It is recommended to collect MustGather data before opening a PMR. This helps IBM® Support quickly determine the root cause of the problem. With this information, Support can determine if: 

 

 1. This is a known problem (rediscovery). 
 2. There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 3. This is a known defect for which a workaround has been developed. 
 4. A new problem has been discovered and a fix is required.

Content Based Retrieval MustGather information 

The following is required troubleshooting information for Content Based Retrieval problems when using FileNet Content Search Services. 

 1. Content Engine Server trace file (p8_server_trace.log) with Error tracing and CBR tracing set at the Summary level only when the problem occurs (you must uncheck the Moderate and Detail checkboxes to reduce the logging verbosity). We may come back and request tracing at Detail level later, but for the first analysis Summary is sufficient. See FileNet Content Engine Server tracing [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21308282] for details on how to collect this information. 
 2. All of the information described in MustGather: Read first for FileNet Content Engine [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg21308231] 
 3. Locate the Content Search Services installation location, (the default location is typically \IBM\Content Search Services\CSS Server).  1. From the \config folder send these files:  *  In Release 5.2, configuration.xml; In previous releases 5.1 and earlier, config.xml jetty.xml key.txt authentication.xml build_info.properties constructors.xml 
        
        
     2. From the config\defaults\ folder send these files:  * collection.xml 
         * parser_config.xml
        
        
     3. From config\defaults\ send the file binary_recognizer_config.xml 
     4. From the \log folder send all log files generated by CSS, i.e. trace*.log, error*.log, commandLineTools0.log, monitor*.log, etc. If the default location for any of the logs was changed in the config files then obtain the .log files from those locations as well. The logging locations are customized in the ecmts_logging.properties or ecmts_config_logging.properties in the \config folder. 
    
    
 4. From either the web-based IBM Administration Console for Content Platform Engine or the Windows-MMC-based Content Engine FileNet Enterprise Manager, take screen shots of:  1. all of the property tabs from each of the search server configurations which are listed on the IBM Search Servers tab in the P8 domain properties 
     2. the IBM Search Configuration tab from the P8 domain properties 
     3. the CBR IBM Search tab from the Object store properties 
     4. the main properties tab of each CSS IndexArea from each object store which is CBR enabled
    
    
 5. If the problem is related to performance, enable the CSS "queue monitoring" as follows:

 * 
 *  
   <monitorQueues>value</monitorQueues>
