APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Prior to DB2 v9.7 FP2,  a service called "Monitoring Agent for
   DB2" was set to auto-start at system boot.   This service
   supports Optim Data Administrator (formerly known as Data Studio
   Administration Console).
   
   As of DB2 v9.7 FP2,  a new install of DB2 will have this service
   set to Manual start.  Applying FP2 as a fixpack to an existing
   copy of DB2 will not change any behavior.
   
   Users of Optim Data Administrator should ensure that the service
   is set to Autostart.
