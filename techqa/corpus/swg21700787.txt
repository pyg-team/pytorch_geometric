QUESTION
 Will Leap Second have any impact on Process Engine (PE) 

CAUSE
Technology authorities have released an upcoming issue with Leap
Second.
What is Leap Second?
Defined: " To ensure the correct alignment of astronomical and atomic time, 
the International Earth Rotation & Reference Systems Service has called for an extra second to be added to Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) at 23:59:59 on June 30, 2015.

ANSWER
Process Engine does not build timestamps, PE gets its timestamps from the system OS and/or Java for the current time, which gives us the number of seconds since 1970. 
We use that internally as an integer (or big int ), so all time calculations are done on that.
If Process Engine needs to display the value, java converts the integer time (which is actually UTC, not in the local time zone) to display the value and then puts it in the requested time zone.

Leap seconds will not be an issue for the PE. We have had 25 Leap seconds over the past 10 years or so.
