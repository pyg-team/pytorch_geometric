Title: IBM ** Troubleshooting ** Standard Reports appear to hang / freeze when sending the output to PDF - United States

Text:
PDF report progress bar intermittently hangs TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User runs a report (e.g. a BI report or a Controller 'standard report', also known as a 'system report'). By default, this displays in HTML initially. This works OK.

User then clicks the dropdown box to modify it to appear as PDF. The display changes to an Adobe Acrobat Reader-style GUI. However, the PDF report does not fully finish appearing (does not completely finish opening).

The problem may appear to be intermittent - sometimes the report displays OK, but sometimes it fails. 

SYMPTOM
The symptoms vary depending on the version of Acrobat Reader version installed on the 
client device: 

 * Adobe Reader 9.5 - a completely empty white page appears with white 
   thumbnails below 
 * Adobe Reader 10.1.x - PDF report progress bar intermittently hangs  * Specifically, a progress meter appears within the Reader 
      frame but never finishes (see below for example):
   
   

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673565&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673565&aid=1] The amount of the report downloaded (in the example above 347.0 Kb) varies each time the same report is run. Sometimes it will hang/stop at a higher figure, sometimes at a lower figure/amount. 

 * In one real-life example, these 'large' files are typically approximately 1Mb, and the download stream stalled at various points such as 282KB, 440KB and 968KB. 


CAUSE
There are several possible causes for similar symptoms: 

 * Scenario #1 - Incompatible settings for how Adobe Reader displays PDF files inside internet browsers  * For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1672938.
   
   

 * Scenario #2 - Defect (APAR PM86538) in Cognos BI 10.2  * For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1673252.
   
   

 * Scenario #3 - Limitation of some versions of Adobe Reader

 * Scenario #4 - Limitation of the Cognos BI engine (in some environments) caused by the setting "Temporary objects location".  * For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1689973.
   
   

ENVIRONMENT
Scenario #3 

In one real-life customer example, the problem only occurred for client PCs that had Adobe Reader version 10.1.8.24 (bad)
The problem did not occur on client devices with version 10.1.2.45 (good) installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Scenario #1 

Ask the end user to modify their Adobe Acrobat Reader internet settings.
· For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1672938.

Scenario #2
Upgrade to either:
· IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2 Refresh Pack 1
· or IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2 Fix Pack 2
...or any later Fix Pack version (recommended).

For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1673252.

Scenario #3
Check/upgrade your version of Adobe Reader. 

 * For example, in one real-life customer example, the problem did not occur when using Adobe Acrobat Reader version 10.1.2.45 
 * In a different customer's environment, upgrading to Acrobat Reader version 10.1.16 solved the problem.


Scenario #4 
Modify the BI (Cognos Connection) setting " Temporary objects location" to be ' Content Store'.  * For full details, see separate IBM Technote #1689973.
