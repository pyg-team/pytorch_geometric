ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DRAFTING (INTDRAFT) / ARABIC TEXT IS NOT
   DISPLAYED PROPERLY IN DRAWING.
   .
   SCENARIO:
   .
   Prerequisites:
   Change the Windows regional option set to allow
   Arabic keyboard functionality
   (Control Panel / Regional Options / Input Locales /
   Add Language -> choose Arabic, OK twice)
   - Keyboard is set to Arabic
   Now.
   1. Launch CATIA
   2. Open a New CATDrawing.
   3. Any Standard (ISO, ASME, ...).
   4. Click the Text button and click in the drawing to
   open the Text Editor
   5. Enter the text and click OK
   .
   RESULTS OBTAINED:
   We can see that there is difference in which text is
   inputted and displayed in the Text editor dialog box
   and the Drawing Sheet.
   In the Text Editor, it is correctly written from right
   to left, as Arabic grammar
   whereas In the Drawing sheet the text is written
   from left to right,
   .
   EXPECTED RESULTS:
   The text should be displayed and inputted in the
   Drawing sheet as in the Text Editor dialog box.
   .

   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   DRAFTING (INTDRAFT) / ARABIC TEXT IS NOT
   DISPLAYED PROPERLY IN DRAWING .
   .
   DEVELOPMENT REQUEST JUSTIFICATION:
   The CATIA V5 annotation modeler only supports
   left to right reading languages. As a consequence,
   running CATIA in arabic windows environment
   causes unspecified behaviors (such as the one
   described in this PMR).
   We understand user perspective which needs an
   enhancement request for the proper Display of
   Text in Arabic language.
   .
   ANSWER AND BYPASS:
   .
   The Bypass to avoid such a behavior is not to use
   annotation modeler (Drafting products,
   FTA...) in arabic environment.
