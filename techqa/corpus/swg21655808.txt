Title: IBM Specifying an alternative to "/tmp" for Tivoli Integrated Portal installs - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 Is there a way to configure the TIP installer to use an alternate directory if the installation user ID has insufficient access rights to "/tmp"? 

ANSWER
TIP L3 has examined the TIP installer and found that /tmp is hard coded in both the TIP and Websphere installers. There is no option available to override /tmp. To pursue a change to the TIP installer to accommodate an alternate tmp location, please submit an enhancement request via the RFE site here:
