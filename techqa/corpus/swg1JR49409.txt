APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When removing a Collaboration Area module from the
   Collaboration Area Console, you will get a
   pop-up-message-window with "Unexpected Error Occurred" after
   you log in again to InfoSphere Master Data Management
   Collaboration Server.
   You need to perform the following steps to experience this
   issue:
   1. create a new Collaboration Area
   2. add the new collaboration area module to left navigation pane
   3. remove the Collaboration Area from the Collaboration Area
   Console.
   4. Log out
   5. log in and you will get a popup-message-window  "Unexpected
   Error Occurred", as the left pane module cannot find the
   removed collaboration area.
   6. Once you close the popup windows and left pane module of the
   removed collaboration area stays blank with circle symbol.
   The expected behavior would be, that the Collaboration Area
   Module is automatically removed also from the Left Navigation
   Plane once it got dropped from the Collaboration Area Console.
   Runtime rendering of left pane modules in UI cannot handle
   references to removed or otherwise undefined data objects and
   this is therefore causing the Unexpected Error Occurred errors
   when you log into MDM CS.
   These errors happen only when the left pane modules are
   initially rendered in login process and after that errors do
   not manifest in any visible way.
