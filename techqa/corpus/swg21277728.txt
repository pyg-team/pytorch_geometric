PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to use "starts with" "ends with" and "contains" operators in Search Designer 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In Workplace 3.5.1, The Search and My Search pages have been combined into a single Search page that provides access to your own simple search or search templates. In addition to "contains," search now supports "starts with" and "ends with" operations. The question is, how do you get these operations to work in Search Designer when they aren't available there. The following information is from FileNet Engineering and I believe it is documented in the 3.5.1 Search Designer help:

"There is help in Search Designer which explains how starts with and ends with work in search designer. Under the covers starts with/ends with works like this:

starts with is equivalent to Like %string -- this is what you enter in search designer
ends with is equivalent to Like string% -- this is what you enter in search designer
contains is equivalent to Like %string% -- this is what you enter in search designer

Workplace then converts the operators and criteria in the template when the template is rendered. Like %string becomes begins with; like string% becomes ends with; and Like %string% becomes contains.

The functionality you are looking for is there, it is just that the specific operators you are expecting aren't. You use the Like operator and the correct syntax with the %wildcard operator. "
