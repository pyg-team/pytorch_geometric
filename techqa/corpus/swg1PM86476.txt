   Initial investigation is pointing to
   com.ibm.team.apt.shared.ui.internal.structure.QuickQueryGrou
   pProvider.getGroupId, where we split on space to create the
   expression segments, and in the case of something like
   state:"In Progress", we end up creating "state:"In" and
   "Progress"" as two separate entities, which of course do not
   match anything. ?I will investigate further today to see if
   this is definitely causing the issue.
