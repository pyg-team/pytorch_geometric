QUESTION
 What is the support policy for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) usage as a supported authentication method for use with IBM Rational ClearCase? 

ANSWER
About LDAP:
LDAP is a free directory sharing protocol that runs over TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). You can configure applications to authenticate users through an LDAP Directory Server. It's a protocol that helps manage network database information about authorized users on a network, such as user accounts, passwords, and what a user is and is not allowed to access. LDAP is vendor and platform neutral, which allows for authenticating users that are working across heterogeneous systems.


About ClearCase Support with LDAP:
ClearCase version 2003.06.15 and later allows ClearCase users to authenticate using the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) industry standard. 

When LDAP authentication is enabled, users enter names and passwords through standard ClearCase dialogs (for example CCRC or CCWeb), and ClearCase will use the LDAP protocol to deliver the appropriate authentication.

This is not to say that ClearCase is integrated with LDAP, it merely runs on top of the operating system already configured to use the LDAP protocol. In other words, ClearCase authenticates with the operating system, and will support LDAP transparently if the OS is configured correctly to support LDAP. 

To ensure ClearCase will authenticate against an LDAP directory, perform the following tasks: 

 * Arrange to work with your LDAP administrator to collect information about your LDAP environment. 
 * Ensure that the LDAP server is installed and configured. 
 * Ensure that the LDAP directory has been created and populated with user information. 
 * Ensure that LDAP access can be had to resources/shares intended to be used by ClearCase users outside of the ClearCase environment. 



Supported LDAP servers: 
ClearCase supports the following LDAP servers that support LDAP protocol Version 3: 
 * IBM Lotus Domino LDAP Server 
 * IBM Tivoli Directory Server 
 * Microsoft Active Directory Server 
 * Novell eDirectory Server 
 * Sun Java System Directory Server
