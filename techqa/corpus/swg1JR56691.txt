ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a federated environment, IBM Process Portal (in IBM Business
   Process Manager (BPM) 8.5.7) shows the list of process instances
    from IBM BPM V8.5.6. When you click a process instance, the
   related information shows in the current page (as expected), but
    you are taken to a new blank page. You must close this blank
   page or select the original page to see the instance details.
   This issue doesn't occur when you open IBM BPM V8.5.7 process
   instances in federated Process Portal.
