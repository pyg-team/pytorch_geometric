Title: IBM EZZ6035I Telnet SSL connections fail with EZZ6035I message, rcode 6002, Parm1 of 000001B2 - United States

gskkyman certificate 1B2 6002 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SSL connections to the Telnet server fail with message EZZ6035I RCODE 6002 Parm1 000001B2. This error means the certificate key is not compatible with the cipher suite. 

CAUSE
A Telnet connection fails with the following message: 

 * 
 * EZZ6035I TELNET DEBUG CLIENT IPADDR..PORT 10.1.2.3..3064 
 *  CONN: 00000047 LU: MOD: EZBTTSMT 
   RCODE: 6002-00 SSL/TLS handshake failed. 
   PARM1: 000001B2 PARM2: PARM3: GSK_SECURE_SOCKET_INIT 

The return code, x'1B2' is 434 in decimal. It means the certificate key is not compatible with the cipher suite. This error can occur if a CA certificate is used as a self-signed certificate. Only end-user user certificates can be used as a server/client certificate. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure the proper end user certificate is created when creating a self-signed certificate with gskkyman. Refer to the Certificate/Key Management chapter in System SSL Programming [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/DOCNUM/SC24-5901/CCONTENTS?], for directions on creating a self-signed certificate with gskkyman.
