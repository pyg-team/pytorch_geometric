APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The addBundles command fails to add an Agent package to the
   TEMS' Depot on a system with TEPS /TEP installed on a system
   other than en_US.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   On a Linux OS change locale of machine to fr_FR.UTF-8.
   Install ITM 6.2.1 TEMS/TEPS and TEP 6.2.1 FP1,
   Install Language Pack.
   Install Application support for the Agent OY.
   Execute tacmd addBundles -i . -t OY
   The Agent's bundle is not installed on the TEMS and an
   "exception" message is recorded in the kuiras1.log file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the locale of the machine to en_US, if possible, to
   install the Agent packages.
   
   Add the Agent's bundle prior to installing TEPS/TEP application
   support for the Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The function that reads the package bundles from the ITM
   installation media reads the data as a binary file. When the
   function calls the String class function to append this data to
   an existing string, the String append function does not find a
   terminating null character during the appending of the data to
   the existing string. As a result, when the data read is greater
   than 1024 characters in length and there are no null bytes
   within that 1024 byte length, a memory access exception is
   raised.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  First convert the input binary data to a null terminated string
   and then perform the append function to an existing string.
