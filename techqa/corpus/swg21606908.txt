Title: IBM LDAP configuration especially when Active Directory is used as LDAP server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We would like to configure embedded application server login settings to enable user authentication with LDAP. (Note that we are not using WebSphere Application Server.)

When we are using Active Directory as LDAP server, the default configuration does not work even if we input correct user name and password in search/text miner application login page.

How do you configure embedded application server login settings when using Active Directory as LDAP server? 

SYMPTOM
You will see FFQM0104E when trying to login to search application (or text miner application) with correct user name and password even.


ENVIRONMENT
Using Active Directory as LDAP server.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use ldifde utility on Active Directory server, or ldapsearch utility to see how the LDAP server is configured. 

For example, run ldifde utility like as follows would results "export.ldf" file:

ldifde -m -f export.ldf -s <target LDAP server name> -d "cn=users,dc=example,dc=com" -b BIND_USERNAME DOMAINNAME PASSWORD

Or, you can get the same sort of result using ldapsearch utility:

ldapsearch -h <target LDAP server name> -D <bind user name> -W <bind user password> -b "cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"

Those command would show LDAP search result with filter like objectClass=*, thus you can confirm which object/attribute should be used for user authentication in the administration console.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Generally speaking, when you are using Active Directory as LDAP server, specify following values in the administration console, not use all default values. 


Note: This is nothing but an example thus you must use your own environment value, especially DC component value. In this example, we use "dc=example,dc=com" as domain name.


 1. BaseDN : cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com 
 2. User ID attribute : sAMAccountName 
 3. Object class for user entries : person (this is the default value) 
 4. Base DN for group entries : dc=example,dc=com 
 5. Group ID attribute : cn 
 6. Member attribute in group entries : member 
 7. Object class for group entries : group



Also, make sure to specify "Use credentials to access to the LDAP server" with proper user name and password to perform bind with that user privilege.
