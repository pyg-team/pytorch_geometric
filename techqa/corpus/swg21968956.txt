Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A new FM has been installed on a client machine : it is able to open existing projects that are based on a TM1 data source and these projects can be modified and packages can be republished.
Old packages already published are working fine with Report Studio.
But when trying to create a new project based on a TM1 data source, the Metadata Wizard is unable to access any of the TM1 datasources. the error is :
TM1-ERR-0050 An attempt to initialize the TM1 API failed. The TM1 error code is 502. 
The TM1 error message is "Could not load tm1api.dll due to: The specified module could not be found."


CAUSE
- On existing projects, for any operations except Metadata Wizard, the data source is queried by the BI Server : the tm1api.dll installed on the server is used.
- But the Metadata Wizard has its own java.exe running and accessing the data source locally : because of this, it has to use a local tm1api.dll.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install TM1 API locally on the client machine running Framework Manager.
