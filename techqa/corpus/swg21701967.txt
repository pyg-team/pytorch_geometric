CVE-2015-2808; RC4; FREAK SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Alternatively you can apply the following workaround on fix packs prior to IF0007. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

 

Version 9.1.0
In IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control 9.1.0, RC4 is disabled by default in all components, but it can be re-enabled through configuration.

To check if RC4 is enabled in your server configuration, follow these steps:

1. If IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control is configured for compliance with FIPS 140-2 or NIST SP800-131a, then RC4 cannot be re-enabled.

2. On the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control server, open the following file

Windows operating system
[INSTALLDIR]\java\jre\lib\security\java.security

Linux operating system
[INSTALLDIR]/java/jre/lib/security/java.security

where [INSTALLDIR] is the server installation directory

check that jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms contains RC4.

For example:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4

3. If there are IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control brokers in your environment, open the broker configuration file, trc_broker.properties, and check DefaultTLSCipherList, and DefaultHTTPSCipherList as well as any TLSCipherList or HTTPSCipherList properties that are defined as part of a connection. The cipher list should always contain !RC4 which disables all cipher suites that use RC4.

For example,
DefaultTLSCipherList = ALL+AES+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!MD5\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH
DefaultHTTPSCipherList = AES\:3DES\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

Inbound.1.ConnectionType = Inbound
Inbound.1.TLSCipherList = ALL+AES+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!MD5\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

Inbound.2.ConnectionType = InboundHTTPS
Inbound.2.HTTPSCipherList = AES\:3DES\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH


Version 9.0.1

In IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control 9.0.1, RC4 is disabled by default in all components except when using the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control broker as a reverse proxy. It can be re-enabled through configuration.

If you have the reverse proxy function configured in the broker, complete the following steps to disable RC4. If the broker is configured for compliance with FIPS 140-2, then RC4 is not enabled and these steps are not required.

1. Open the broker configuration file:
Windows: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Tivoli\Remote Control\Broker\trc_broker.properties
Linux: /etc/trc_broker.properties

2. If necessary, add the DefaultHTTPSCipherList property if it is not there already.

3. Change the value for the DefaultHTTPSCipherList property so that \!RC4 is included in the list. Items in the list are separated with colons. 
For example:

DefaultHTTPSCipherList = TLSv1\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

4. Check for InboundHTTPS or InboundHTTPS6 connections that override the default HTTPSCipherList. Apply the same change if necessary.
For example:

Inbound1.ConnectionType = InboundHTTPS
Inbound1.HTTPSCipherList = TLSv1\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

5. Stop and restart the broker service.



To check if RC4 is enabled in your server configuration, complete the following steps:

1. If IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control is configured for compliance with FIPS 140-2, then RC4 can not be re-enabled.

2. On the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control server, open the following file

Windows operating system
[INSTALLDIR]\java\jre\lib\security\java.security

Linux operating system
[INSTALLDIR]/java/jre/lib/security/java.security

where [INSTALLDIR] is the server installation directory.

Check that jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms contains RC4. 

For example:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4

3. If there are IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control brokers in your environment, open the broker configuration file, trc_broker.properties, and check DefaultTLSCipherList, and DefaultHTTPSCipherList as well as any TLSCipherList or HTTPSCipherList defined as part of a connection. The cipher list should always contain !RC4 which disables all cipher suites that use RC4.

For example,
DefaultTLSCipherList = TLSv1+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH
DefaultHTTPSCipherList = TLSv1\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH 


In version 9.1.0 and 9.0.1
It is also recommended to disable RC4 in the Java Run-time Environment used with the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller. This can be done by adding RC4 to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property in the java.security file on the controller system. 

Windows operating system
