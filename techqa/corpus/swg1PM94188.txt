ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Headline:
   Duplicate and missing test script execution entries in the test
   suite execution results
   
   Abstract:
   Executing Test Suite execution steps in a non-chronological
   order causes some missing execution results whereas others
   appear multiple times in the Test Suite execution results.
   
   Error Description:
   To reproduce the issue :
   - create a test case and associate 12 test scripts to it
   - create a test suite and associate 12 times that same test case
   to it.
   - edit the test suite to change the default test script for each
   of the attached test case entry to have :
   Test suite -?
   TC -? test script 1
   TC -? test script 2
   TC -? test script 3
   TC -? test script 4
   TC -? test script 5
   TC -? test script 6
   TC -? test script 7
   TC -? test script 8
   TC -? test script 9
   TC -? test script 10
   TC -? test script 11
   TC -? test script 12
   - execute the test suite in parallel using the following order:
   execute test script 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, skip 7 and 8, execute 9 10
   11 then execute 7 and 8.
   - looking at the test suite result : 7 and 12 are missing from
   the results and 9 and 10 are listed twice.
   
   WORKAROUND:
   The workaround is to execute the steps in chronological order
   from 1 till 12.
