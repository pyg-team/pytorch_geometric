APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has a custom logging server that uses the IICE
   appender. The logging server is started and the application
   initializes the server with adding an appender when the
   application is started.  When the logging server is restarted
   without restarting the application server, the logger stops
   writing to the log files and no error message is written out.
   
   Customer should be warned of the problem so she can identify
   that there is a logging problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround: restart the application server after the logging
   server is restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The logging server is started and the application
   initializes the server with adding an appender when the
   application is started.  When the logging server is restarted
   without restarting the application server, the logger stops
   writing to the log files and no error message is written out.
   
   There should be some indication of the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code fix contains a new method that allows the customer to
   implement and handle the log exception.
