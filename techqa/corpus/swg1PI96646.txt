APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the WUI server region is started WARM (START=AUTO) the
   following messages occur:
   .
     DFHSJ0002 applid A severe error (code X'0B21') has occurred
     in module DFHSJJS.
   .
   This 0B21 error is associated with exception trace entry:
   .
     SJ 0B21 SJJS  *EXC* CJSR_STILL_ACTIVE
       SET_JVMSERVER,DISABLED,EYUCMCIJ,PHASEOUT,NO
   .
   which is issued if the CJSR transaction is still active when
   trying to bring down the JVM server.  Typically during a WARM
   start the JVMSERVER resources which are cataloged and therefore
   recovered.  But for the CMCI JVM server, EYUCMCIJ, this
   JVMSERVER is being DISABLED/DISCARDed and then replaced by a
   newly installed one.  This is failing because when we try to
   phase it out, we find the CJSR task is still active and issue
   the error.
   .
   If the region is started INITIAL or COLD, the problem does not
   occur.
   .

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICSPlex SM V5R4M0 users,                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A CICSPlex SM WUI region issues         *
   *                      message DFHSJ0212 or DFHSJ0002 during   *
   *                      a CICS WARM or EMERGENCY restart.       *
   ****************************************************************
   A CICSPlex SM WUI region is configured to provide the
   CICS management client interface (CMCI), using a JVM server.
   The WUI region is stopped, and restarted using START=AUTO to
   perform a CICS WARM or EMERGENCY restart.
   During the restart, the WUI attempts to discard and recreate
   its internal resources, including the CMCI JVM server.
   A timing issue while doing this leads to the JVM failing to
   restart. CICS issues message
   +DFHSJ0002 applid A severe error (code X'0B21') has occurred
              in module DFHSJJS.
   In another presentation of the problem the JVM may fail to
   terminate, and CICS will issue message DFHSJ0212:
   DFHSJ0212 date time applid An error occurred while terminating
             the JVM belonging to the JVMSERVER resource EYUCMCIJ.
              Reason code: TERMINATION_TIMED_OUT
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CPSM WUI server has been updated so that if JVM server
   EYUCMCIJ is recovered from the catalog during a WARM or
   EMERGENCY restart then the JVM server will not be deleted and
   reinstalled. CICS will attempt to set EYUCMCIJ to the ENABLED
   state if necessary.
   .
   Message EYUVS0217I is no longer issued and will be removed.
   Message EYUVS0219I is updated as follows:
   EYUVS0219I applid CICS Management Client Interface JVM server
              EYUCMCIJ enabled. Establishing server using
              port number portnumber.
   The CICSPlex SM Knowledge Center will be updated with these
   changes.
