QUESTION
 How do you know the list of properties located under MSVC/LINUX environment metaclass that can be referenced in the generated make file? 

CAUSE
Properties located under MSVC/LINUX environment metaclass doesn't work in accordance with their property description. Below are examples:

CPP_CG::MSVC::NoneInstLibs
The NoneInstLibs property is used to specify the static libraries that are required when Instrumentation Mode is set to None. In the makefile, these appear in the line that begins with INST_LIBS.

CPP_CG::MSVC::NoneOxfLibs
The NoneOxfLibs property is used to specify the framework libraries that are required when Instrumentation Mode is set to None. In the makefile, these appear in the line that begins with OXF_LIBS. 

ANSWER
Unlike Cygwin, you cannot reference properteis under MSVC/LINUX environment metaclass in makefile. These properties are provided primarily with Eclipse & Visual Studio workflow integration in mind. When integrating Rhapsody with these IDEs, Rhapsody will access the list of properties depending on the instrumentation mode you choose (None, Animation, Trace, Web-enabled) and make appropriate changes to the connected project setting: 



 * AnimInstLibs

 * NoneOxfLibs

 * NoneIncludeDirectories 

 * TracePreprocessor

 * AnimOxfLibs

 * CompilerFlags (*1)

 * AdaptorSearchPath 

 * NonePreprocessor

 * TraceInstLibs

 * LinkerFlags (*1)

 * GetConnectedRuntimeLibraries

 * IncludeDirectories

 * TraceOxfLibs 

 * DefinedSymbols 

 * AnimPreprocessor 

 * AnimIncludeDirectories 

 * NoneInstLibs

 * TraceIncludeDirectories

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676279&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676279&amp;aid=1] (*1) Only copied when Eclipse integration invoked along with GNU tool chain. 

Additionally, these properties are being referenced in <LANG>::Cygwin::MakeFileContent from which the makefile for Cygwin is generated. However, they are not referenced in the same property for MSVC and Linux. The reason being is, there are different mechanisms of make file generation employed for different environments. In MSVC, those properties are chosen not to be hard coded considering other usage such as generation of OXF framework dlls (see RPFrameWorkDll property). 

NOTE: 
You can always use relevant keywords in MakeFileContent. For example, the keyword $(NoneInstLibs) you added in MakeFileContent will be replaced with libraries you specified at NoneInstLibs property.
