ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: OOM and performance problems while doing unfiltered
   search for
   accounts through "Manage Service" page.
   
   Description:  Customer has 50000+ accounts and each account is
   
   considerably large size. They have set
   enrole.ui.maxSearchResults to
   1,00,000 to display all their service accounts on unfiltered
   search. But
   when they execute unfiltered search for Accounts through "Manage
   Service" page, OOM occurs and
   javax.naming.directory.SearchResult was
   shown as main leak suspect. However same scenario used to work
   in their
   ITIM 4.6. L3 provided a FIXTST to fix the OOM issue. After
   resolving OOM
   error, slow performance was observed while displaying
   accounts in a table. L3 provided second FIXTST to fix the
   performance issue and after apply FIXTST the total search
   time required was reduced from approx 34 minutes to approx
   8 minutes.
   
   Steps to duplicate:
   1. Have 50,000+ accounts on a service and each account of
   considerably
   large size.
   2. Set the enrole.ui.maxSearchResults to 100000 in
   ui.properties.
   3. Navigate to Manage Service-> Search-> Accounts(for a specific
   service)-> Search for Account
   Observe that OOM occurs and ITIM fails to return the results.
   Further
   observe the slow performance while displaying a large number of
   accounts.
   
   Desired Behavior: OOM should not occur while searching accounts
   through
   Manage Service and performance should be improved for the same.
   
   Environment: ITIM 5.1-FP9, AIX 5.3, WAS 6.1-FP35, 2 node
   cluster, ITDS
   6.2.0.3
