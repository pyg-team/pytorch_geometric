PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Need to remove the nodes with same name (there are several node names which is the same) and leave only 1 node name in TEPS tree view. 

SYMPTOM
Several different causes can result in the following issues. 

Issue A : Same node names exist and you want to remove all the same-named nodes and leave only 1 in tree. 

Issue B : Individual leaf (node) names for different devices. The individual leaf nodes are with the same name and only one of which reports activity. 


CAUSE
Issue B : Mostly it is due to the too long hostnames /long and similar starting server names.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Issue A. (see symptom above for description) 

 Here is how to remove/trim the same node name down to 1 node (with the name) left in TEPS view. 


1. Stop the SOA Agent. 
2. Click (with 2nd mouse) the subnode that you want to remove, and choose "Clear offline entry" 
3. From KD4.dc.properties file, remove all the entry about the host/server that you deleted from TEPS and save it. 

 Example : If you deleted the entry related to Data Power, the related entry (to be removed) looks like this.
8.<DP hostname>.monitor=on
8.<DP hostname>.log=error
8.<DP hostname>.trace=off
8.<DP hostname>.control.count=1
8.<DP hostname>.control.1=*;*;*;*;*;none
8.<DP hostname>.filter.control.count=0 

 
4. Remove (windows: <ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\KD4\logs\KD4.DCA.CACHE\persist, unix: <ITM_HOME>/<platform>/d4/KD4/logs/KD4.DCA.CACHE\persist) directory. 

 
5. Restart SOA Agent. 
6. From TEPS view, you should be able to see the deleted entry is gone. 

 

Issue B. (see symptom above for description) 

1. Change the file KD4.dc.properties (windows: <ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\KD4\config, unix: <ITM_HOME>/<platform>/d4/KD4/config) 

Change kd4.ira.useCTIRAHostname=0 to 1. 

2. Change the Hostname to shorter name (ex: from "IBMHostname5" to "B5") - so that the remaining field of the whole node name will be filled with more characters of front portion of server name - by following description below - 

(in ManageTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) 

 a. Stop SOA Agent -> click right mouse on "SOA Agent". 

 b. Click "Advanced" -> "Edit Variables" 

 c. The screens will show as below (ITCAM for SOA: Override Local Variable Settings). 

 d. Choose "CTIRA_HOSTNAME" and click "Edit" as shown. 

 e. The "Edit Environment Setting Override" screen will pop up. Change the name to shorter hostname, preferrably that hostname length of 2) -> click OK.
