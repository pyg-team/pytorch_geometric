PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You would like to order a CICS product or maintenance. You want to know what options are available for ordering the product, individual PTFs, and cumulative maintenance for CICS or any of the CICS tools. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Refer to the following if you are using z/OS : 

 * Ordering z/OS and related IBM products [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.e0zb100/ooaripr.htm] in the z/OS documentation for the various installation methods you can use when ordering CICS TS and related IBM products. Refer to Installing CICS [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/installing.html] for instructions specific to CICS.
   
   
 * Software maintenance strategy for CICS TS and its embedded components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530#recommendations] when planning for updates to CICS TS and related software components such as WebSphere Liberty and CICS Explorer. If needed, individual PTFs can be ordered from Shopz [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/ShopzSeries/ShopzSeries.jsp].
   
   
 * User Guide, videos, and FAQs on the Shopz main page [https://www.ibm.com/software/shopzseries/ShopzSeries_public.wss] for information on placing and tracking orders for System z software. If you have questions about Shopz user authorization, refer to the User Guide and Help on the Roles and Authorization Management (RAM) [https://www.ibm.com/software/ram/public/landing] page. 


If you are using z/VSE, see the z/VSE home page [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zvse/] for links to z/VSE "Service & support" or "How to buy".
