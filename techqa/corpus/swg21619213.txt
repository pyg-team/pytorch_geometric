Title: IBM Starting and Stopping Impact 6.1 - United States

stop server; start server; 6.1 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am confused on start stop commands for Impact 6.1. I just want to shut down the whole application, TIP, impact and GUI. Which one do I use? 

CAUSE
There is ewasGUIStartStop.sh and ewasImpactStartStop.sh and stopServer.sh and startServer.sh scripts in the $TIP_HOME/profiles/TIPProfile/bin directory. 

ANSWER
Unfortunately, since the GUI server and Impact server have been split in 2 in Impact 6.1, there isn't a single command now to stop and start both servers at once. 

 
The ewasGUIStartStop.sh stops and starts the Impact GUI server, and is the equivalent of running the stopServer and startServer commands located in the /TIPProfile/bin - the GUI server subdir. 

The ewasImpactStartStop.sh stops and starts the Impact Data server, and is the equivalent of running the stopServer and startServer commands located in the /ImpactProfile/bin - the Data Server subdir.
