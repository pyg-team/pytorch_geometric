PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While trying to connect to a database endpoint (Oracle / SQL Server) receiving the error message "Login has timed out" 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Below are a few possibilities that could cause this issue to occur:

1. Invalid Credentials
> Please check whether the entered credentials are valid.

2. Invalid Database name 
> If the message below in error.log located under the Cast Iron Studio installer directory is observed then the given database name is incorrect. Please re-verify the database name and provide the database name in the endpoint.

"com.castironsys.jdbc.base.BaseSQLException: [CastIron Systems][SQLServer JDBC Driver][SQLServer]Cannot open database "SQLServer" requested by the login. The login failed."
SEVERE: Can't get the database connection. java.sql.SQLException: [CastIron Systems][SQLServer JDBC Driver]Login has timed out."

3. Database is behind a firewall and the default port 1433 is not accessible.
> Please verify whether the Database using the port 1433 is accessible. This can be done by using Aqua Data Studio or by performing a telnet <database host> <database port>.
