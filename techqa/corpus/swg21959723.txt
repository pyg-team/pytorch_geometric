Title: IBM UDX compilation error - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Following error can be met during UDX compilation.
Can't exec "/nz/kit/bin/adm/nzudxcompile": Argument list too long 

SYMPTOM
nzudxcompile command returns an "Argument list too long" error and aborts.


CAUSE
ARG_MAX configuration parameter limits the number of argument list in command line. In this case the client used more than 131072 argument with many program *.c files.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check ARG_MAX value in the command line: 

$ getconf ARG_MAX
131072


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax [http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax]). 

But we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23. So we have no way to allow ARG_MAX larger than 131072 at this time.
