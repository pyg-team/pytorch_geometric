Audio approximate time index: Time Question & answer summary 0:00 Introduction and presentation 22:00 When will the Lotus Quickr Connectors work with Windows 7 64-bit? How will be informed of this?

Support for Windows 7 64-bit is planned for Q3, with delivery in a Connectors fix pack. To keep informed when fixes are released for Lotus Quickr, subscribe to IBM My Notifications [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html]. You can customize how you want to receive notices (such as by e-mail, custom Web page, or RSS feed) and what those notices include (for example, fixes, technotes, news, and so on). 24:00 The Connectors send information in clear text . Any changes planned, or is SSL the only option?

SSL is the standard way to secure the environment. We are not aware of any plans to encrypt communication with the Connectors. 24:40 Because Domino 8.5.2 is not supported, is there a recommended Domino 8.5.1 Fix Pack for Quickr 8.5? Such as FP4?

When Quickr 8.5.0 came out, the minimum required was Lotus Domino 8.5.1 Fix Pack 3 (FP3); Quickr 8.5.0 is also supported with FP4 or FP5. Your goal should be to migrate to Quickr 8.5.1, the latest release. For Quickr 8.5.1, Domino 8.5.1 FP5 is recommended. 26:00 Q&A ends; polling question and closing remarks 
Web conference chat summary: 1 8.5.2 support?

If you mean support for Domino 8.5.2, there are no plans to support Quickr 8.5.1 with it yet. 
See "Lotus Quickr 8.5 for Domino not supported with Domino 8.5.2" (#1445806) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21445806] 2 Support for Office 2010?

We are expecting support for Office 2010 on the Connectors in Q3 2011. 3 I saw document reference LO54192 "Cannot create meetings behind RP with Quickr and ST integrated" Is there any more info on this? 

Unfortunately, there are no plans to fix this behavior because that feature is being re-architected. Will be re-examined for future consideration. 4 For newsletters the Place name hotspot doesn't seem to use the Email URL prefix listed in Site administration. Is this suppose to be that way? 

re: the URL Prefix issue, it sounds like a match for a known issue. ASAI87TH5N Issues with place invitation, the “Email URL Prefix” setting within Site Administration is not being honored, nor is the <password_message> setting from qpconfig.xml. It is fixed in 8.5.1 FixPack 1 (& higher).

I'm running 8.5.1 FP3. The URL prefix is used when the notify feature is used... just the link to place in newsletter isn't obeying it.

My understanding is that newsletters mails should use the URL prefix too. So, this could be a possible defect. If you have a reproducible scenarios, we'd recommend to open a service request with IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html]. 5 Upgrading to Quickr 8.5.1 FP 3 has proved to be extremely painful for my company. We use the webseal for external authentication and have been grandfathering sites since the Quickplace days so if you don't do that then your experience may be different. Just wanted to share.......

Our upgrade went pretty great. We use DataPower for authentication and SSO to Quickr 

Our biggest pain points were that we weren't prepared to upgrade our 8.2 places to 8.5.1 theme and we didn't know ActiveX was being replaced with a required download of the Connectors (which doesn't currently work anyway).

IBM panel replied "Thank you for sharing your feedback. We will pass this along to our development team." 6 Since 852 is not supported, is there a recommended Domino 851 FixPack for Quickr 8.5? Such as FP4?

Answered in Audio 7 Connectors send information in clear text - is there any plans to resolve? or is SSL our only option?

Answered in Audio 8 On the initial upgrade chart in the presentation, it does not say QuickPlace 7 to Quickr 8.5.1.

For upgrading from QuickPlace 7 to 8.5.1, you will need to first go to Quickr 8.2.
