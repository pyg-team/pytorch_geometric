APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OMNIBUS 7.2 User Guide:
   Chapter 3 page 40;
   
   "You can hide events that you no longer want to view in the
   event list. Hidden events do not appear in any monitor boxes or
   event lists, except for those using the All Events filter. You
   can hide events only if you have permission to do so. When you
   hide an event, it is hidden in all operator event lists."
   
   
   The expectation is that once an event is marked as "hidden"
   that the event is suppressed in all event lists.  This is not
   the case.  Using the -> Prioritize -> Suppress/Escalate ->
   Hidden tool sets the SuppressEscl field value to 5.  The event
   will still appear in ANY event list where the filter allows for
   a match of SuppressEscl=5.

   The revised text should read:
   
   You can hide events that you no longer want to view in the
   event list. Hidden events typically do not appear in any
   monitor boxes or event lists, except for those using the All
   Events filter. You can hide events only if you have permission
   to do so.
   
   To hide selected events in the event list, click Alerts >
   Prioritize > Suppress/Escalate > Hidden. This sets the value of
   the SuppressEscl field to 5 in the alerts.status table. When
   you hide an event, it is hidden in all operator event lists
   except those where the filter allows for a match of
   SuppressEscl=5.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated with the release of
   IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.3.
