QUESTION
 How to get debug information when the IBM Content Navigator Installer on the Unix Platform is failling?


ANSWER
To capture the debug output from the UNIX command line, enter one of the following (based on what shell you are using) at the command line prior to executing the installer:
export LAX_DEBUG=true or setenv LAX_DEBUG true or LAX_DEBUG=true or set LAX_DEBUG or whatever would be appropriate for the Unix shell. 

Then run the installer. The output that is produced should help debug the installer. 
If you would like to redirect output to a file:
1. Set LAX_DEBUG=file as per the instruction above. 
2. Run your installer. 
3. Once the install is complete a file labeled jx.log will be generated in the same directory as your installer. This file will contain the entire debug output generated by the install.
