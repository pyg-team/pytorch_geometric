Title: IBM OMNIBus event not showing hostname - United States

Text:
itm lfa event hostname malformed node E-JPR-000-000 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM events from LFA are not showing hostname. The Node field is empty. 

CAUSE
The event did not have the hostname or the event was malformed.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1) Enable debug and raw capture on the EIF Probe. 
2) Review the problem events captured in the raw capture file.
- Check whether the event is missing the hostname field.
- Check for malformed event error:
E-JPR-000-000: Received a malformed alarm raised against the problem event.

A malformed event may fail to have the hostname tokenised to Node even though the malformed event does have the hostname field populated.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issue is on the ITM side. Contact your ITM Support team to assist with EIF slot customisation.
