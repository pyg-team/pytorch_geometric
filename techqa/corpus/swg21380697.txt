PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to launch IBM Rational Software Architect results in an error from the Java Virtual Machine Launcher stating "Could not create the Java virtual machine". 

SYMPTOM
Attempts to launch IBM Rational Software Architect results in the following error: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21380697&amp;aid=1]

CAUSE
The Java Virtual Machine uses the -Xmx switch to define the maximum size of the JVM's heap memory. If you are seeing this error message it is likely that the -Xmx switch in the eclipse.ini file is set too high for the current environment.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two possible solutions for this issue. 

 

 1. Remove the line in the eclipse.ini file that starts -Xmx
    
    Note: eclipse.ini is located in your RSA install folder (default is C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\)
    
    
    or
    
    
 2. Reduce the value of the -Xmx switch
    
    By default, the value of the -Xmx switch in RSA 7.5.x is 1024 m. Slowly reduce this value until the tool is able to launch (usually 928 m). 
    
    For this example
    
    -Xmx1024m
    
    becomes
    
    -Xmx928m
    
    Only lower the value just far enough to allow the tool to launch, as the lower this value is, the less memory RSA is allowed to use. You may run into performance problems if the value is set too low.
    
    Note: eclipse.ini is in your RSA installation folder (default is C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\)
