QUESTION
 Why does the transmission error is not recorded in Atlas for invalid email address ? 

CAUSE
You notice a matter exception is generated with the bounced back email for the corresponding notice even though Atlas did not flag transmission error.

ANSWER
When a SMTP server is setup to accept all the emails , both valid and invalid and does not flag an error at transmission time , there is no mechanism in Atlas to record as an error under Notices Sent tab in the Hold Notice if it is not flagged as error during transmission time.
