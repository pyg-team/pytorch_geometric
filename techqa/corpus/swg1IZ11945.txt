APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Existing agent code can process and send data to Tivoli
   Enterprise Management Server for up to approximately 54,000
   jobs.
   This is due to restrictions on the amount of data that can be
   stored in the internal memory buffers. This can cause data
   collection skipped on some jobs if more than 54000 jobs active
   on the system.
   This can lead to some job related situations not trigger as
   expected.
   
   Agent code need to be updated to add more filtering to the job
   selection criteria. Situation conditions can be used to set the
   job selection criteria for situations and environment variables
   can be used to set the job selection criteria for views on work
   spaces.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   This problem can not be recreated normally on systems with
   normal job load.
   More than 54,000 jobs need to exist on the i5/OS system to
   recreate this problem.
   
   1. Create more than 54,000 jobs on a i5/OS system. Some customer
   systems have around 250,000 jobs. A CL program to create dummy
   jobs can be used to create more jobs on the system
   programmatically.
   
   2. Verify product provided Job Resource Information view on Jobs
   and Queues workspace to see if all jobs are listed.  View may
   time out or entries for some jobs may be missing.
   
   3. Create and start some situations using Job attribute group
   and verify if they trigger as expected.
