QUESTION
When a Roaming User logs on to a multi-user Lotus NotesÂ® client machine for the first time, there is a lengthy delay. The issue occurs if the Administrator has attempted to modify the Notes.ini file used by the multi-user install on that workstation to force the use of a port compression setting; the compression setting is not kept. 

This can be a problem for Administrators who want port compression enabled while their users are logging on, since this can be the highest period of traffic for files being downloaded (Bookmark.nsf, Names.nsf, Journal.nsf, etc.) to the Notes client for Roaming Users.


ANSWER
This issue has been reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# JIZO5LHNVK. There are no current plans to address this issue.

This issue is not specific to the Roaming User feature or roaming users; it occurs when the Administrator attempts to implement a multi-user setup on a workstation and "hard codes" TCP/IP port compression for all users with accounts for that workstation. Whether the user is roaming or non-roaming, the port compression Notes.ini entry is removed on Notes client setup. 

Additional attempts to launch Notes client will not require local replication of the roaming databases, so the Notes client will open faster. However, if the Administrator implements the multi-user Cleanup option to remove all files on client shutdown for the Roaming User, and the port compression has not been subsequently enabled (in the user interface or via a policy document), then the delay will recur because the roaming databases will need to replicate locally once again.

To enable compression on the TCPIP port for the workstation the user needs to select File > Preferences > User Preferences, then switch to the Ports pane, select the desired Communications Port and select the 'Compress Network Data' checkbox for that port. 

Note: The user cannot set this preference until the Notes client is set up on the machine for the first time. Once the user sets the preference, the Notes client has to be closed and restarted in order for the preference change to take effect.

If an attempt is made to set the TCPIP= line in the Notes.ini for compression and have that Notes.ini reside as a "template" in the \Documents and Settings folder of the computer, the compression value is stripped from that line entry, and instead the client is set up without port compression.


Another workaround may be to implement a Desktop Policy where this compression value can be set for all new client setups.

To reproduce the issue:

1. First, install a Notes Multi-User client.
2. Make sure that TCPIP compression is off (see note in step 3 below), then shut down the Notes client.
3. Enable TCP/IP Port compression by opening the Notes.ini in a text editor and add '12320' to the TCPIP= line, as follows:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


4. Relaunch the Notes client. Notes will launch with compression already enabled for the TCPIP port. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 * 

 * 

 * 


So, although this issue readily appears to be a problem with the Roaming User feature itself, it is actually a problem specifically with the multi-user install. You do not need to implement a multi-user client install to use the Roaming User feature. Therefore, this problem limits the use of port compression if the Administrator desires to have users on this same workstation roam as well.
