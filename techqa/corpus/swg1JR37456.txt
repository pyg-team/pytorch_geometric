ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Items can be added to specific category nodes by expanding the
   hierarchy tree in the catalog module in the left nav
   pane and then choosing "add item" from right mouse click context
   menu.
   In case the category node has a very long Displayname, which
   cannot be displayed fully in the left navigation pane (in order
   to  see it fully you would have to use the horizontal slider for
   the catalog module), and you add an item, the display
   of the hierarchy tree will be left shifted and you will have to
   use the catalog modules horizontal slider to shift the display
   again to the right in order to see the hierarchy tree structure
   properly.
