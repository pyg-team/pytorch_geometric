Title: IBM Deployed patterns require updates when style sheets reference objects - United States

QUESTION
 After I deploy a pattern with a style sheet that references an object, why does the style sheet reference the wrong artifact? 

CAUSE
When you deploy a pattern, you specify the service name. This name is the prefix to all new objects that the deployment process creates.
When the source service for the pattern includes a style sheet that referenced an object, the appliance does not modify the style sheet and does not update the style sheet to point to the new object with the service name prefix.


ANSWER
Access the style sheet that contains the reference, and update the style sheet to use the correct reference.
