PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TIP upgrade fails. Installer logs show 'Invalid User ID or password.' error. 

SYMPTOM

C:\tiv\cdimage.fixpack>install.bat -i silent -f sample_response.txt
FAILURE: The overall installation fails. Check C:\Users\rcc659\TIPFPInstaller-00.log

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure the WebSphere login/password on the server is same as in sample_response.txt file used to to do the upgrade. 


#---- Valid inputs: cannot be empty
IAGLOBAL_WASUserID=tipadmin
# You can change the default password here, and password should not be empty or have dash (-) as the first char.
IAGLOBAL_WASPassword=tippass 

 

Important: Make sure that there are no empty spaces at the end to the userID or password. This would cause the install to fail as well.
