ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description: WPS 6101 fails with an exception when trying to
   federate a stand alone portal server (i.e. a plain WAS profile)
   into a Process Server Cell that already contains a process
   server. The exception is "A new instance of the WorkManagerInfo
   object cannot be created because the jndiName attribute of an
   existing WorkManagerInfo object has the same
   value as wm/AppScheduler." This breaks the main install path for
   setting up a single cell process portal. This issue has already
   been discussed with development. The problem appears to be
   caused by the AppScheduler (specifically AppSchedulerImportStepE
   xt.java appears to not take the federation of plain WAS profiles
   into account).
   
   the scenario used to generate the traces / error:
   1. Installed 6.1.0.1 Process Server DM (Dmgr01)  (Box A)
   2. Created custom profile (custom01) on Dmgr01 (Box A)
   3. Create a Process Server in custom01
   4. Enabled SCA and process/task containers
   5. Enabled BPCExplorer
   6. Process Server Cell is operating ok.
   7. Installed portal 6.1. stand alone (portal default install)
   -->
   wp_profile (plain WAS profile) (Box B)
   8. Tried to federate portal node into Dmgr01 --> Exception.
