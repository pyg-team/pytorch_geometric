QUESTION
 My RUNSTATS utility job is taking a long time to run. How can I make it run faster? 

ANSWER
Usually the reason a RUNSTATS job takes a long time to run is because you used the COLUMN(ALL) option (which is the default when you specify a particular table). Consider only collecting column statistics on those columns commonly used as WHERE clause predicates.
