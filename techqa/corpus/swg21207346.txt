QUESTION
 I had an evaluation copy of the compiler installed on my system. I upgraded to the official release, but I am now getting the following error message: 

> xlC -o junk junk.cxx
xlC: 1501-221 cannot exec program c++filt3 - No such file or directory

Why is this?


ANSWER
If you have an evaluation copy of the compiler installed on your system, the packages DevTools.pkg and DeveloperTools.pkg have installed c++filt3 on your system. However,
the evaluation copy is not forward-compatible and that is the reason for the error.

To solve the problem, you can try the following:

1. Create a symbolic link as follows:

> cd /opt/ibmcmp/vacpp/6.0/bin/
> ln -s /usr/bin/c++filt c++filt3

2. Edit the /etc/opt/ibmcmp/vac/6.0/vac.cfg file.

Locate the DEFLT section of the vac.cfg file. Change the "cppfilt" attribute from "c++filt3" to "c++filt".
