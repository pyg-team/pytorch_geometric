APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cust is using the Oracle iPlanet web server Master SNMP agent
   
   (magt) which has two instances defined.
   
   To monitor these instances, he uses our HT monitoring agent.
   The problem is that when the khtagent is started, CPU usage
   jumps up from 0.1% minimal on the SNMP magt server to about 25%
   range and stays in that range.  If the khtagent is disabled, or
   not used, the CPU drops down to normal 0.1% usage.
   
   So it looks like our khtagent is somehow introducing high CPU to
   the Sun magt server process.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM for HTTP agent users, monitoring
   * multiple Sun Java Web Server (Oracle iPlanet) with the same
   * KHT agent.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Master SNMP agent (magt) causes high
   * CPU usage.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update KHT agent to version 7.1.0.3 IF4
   * or newer.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  KHT agent polls monitoring data from SNMP agent. In environment
   with many instances of Web Server, parallel calls from KHT may
   overload SNMP agent, what causes high CPU.
   Fix avoids parallel calls, and introduces new configuration
   parameter KHT_pollingTimeout_msec, what makes possible increase
   of default interval (5000 msec) between two subsequent SNMP
   calls.
   Instruction of change:
   Modify file khtwb.properties, adding new line:
   -DKHT_pollingTimeout_msec=value
      where value is a number of miliseconds between 2 subsequent
      data requests from SNMP agent. Default it is 5000.
      For example, for 1 minute timeout, you should set:
   -DKHT_pollingTimeout_msec=60000
