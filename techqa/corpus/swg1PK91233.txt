APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CUstomer noticed the following errors on one of the jsc servers
   on z/OS:
   EQQPH25E TME USER ID MISSING IN RACF CLASS TMEADMIN:
   EQQPH25I TWSUSER@zCONN.ABC.123.COM
   .
   There may also appear EQQPH26E and EQQPH26I if TME mapping
   is used.
   .
   The problem is due to the missing Security credentials of the
   TWSUSER which is the User Id of the zConnector. This is
   regardless of the methods used for establishing credentials
   (TMEADMIN or USERMAP).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In TWS 8.5 were introduced new features on TDWC regarding the
   connection the zConnector.
   .
   This new release of TWS 8.5 ALSO introduced the SHARING of the
   eWAS between the TWS DIstributed Connector, the zConnector and
   TDWC.
   .
   For this reasons and to maintain compatibility between
   TDWC and the JSC, there is a RACF requirement for the TWS
   Userid for the zConnector to be ALSO defined in the zOS
   environment.
   .
   The RACF credentials for the zConnector Uer id is the same as
   that of the JSC and TDWC CLient Users that are also defined in
   the zOS environment IF the zConnector User ID will be used by
   a JSC Client to access the zOS environment as they will also
   need access to TWSz FIXED and SUBRESOURCES
   .
   However, IF the zConnector User ID will NEVER be used as a LOGIN
   client, then ONLY READ access to the TWSz Application is
   required .
   .
   This was NOT a requirement on the previous release (8.3) of the
   product.
   .
   The initial handshaking on prior release between the zOS
   Server and the zCnnector was limited to the JSC/TDWC CLients
   only and therefore this is a NEW requirement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TWSz users connecting to TDWC through    *
   *                 z/Connect 8.5                                *

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During connection of Dynamic Workload   *
   *                      Console and JSC to TWSz Server the      *
   *                      following error message                 *
   *                      EQQPH25E TME USER ID MISSING IN RACF    *
   *                               CLASS TMEADMIN:                *
   *                      EQQPH25I TWSUSER@TWS01.POK.IBM.COM      *
   *                      is issued.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY THE PTF FIXING THIS APAR               *
   ****************************************************************
   When Dynamic Workload Console and JSC connect to TWSz Server
   the following error message:
   EQQPH25E TME USER ID MISSING IN RACF CLASS TMEADMIN:
   EQQPH25I TWSUSER@TWS01.POK.IBM.COM
   is got because the WebSphere Application Server administrator
   is not mapped in the parameter library member (specified
   in the USERMAP parameter of the SERVOPT) with a RACF user ID.

   |Chapter 3.  Implementing Security                            |
   |Section.    Controlling access to Tivoli Workload scheduler  |
   |            for z/OS                                         |
   |Subsection. Controlling access to Tivoli Workload scheduler  |
   |            for z/OS using Dynamic Workload Console or Job   |
   |            Scheduling Console                               |
   |                                                             |
   |After the sentence:                                          |
   |z/OS security is based on a table that maps the administrator|
   |to a RACF user ID. When a WebSphere Application Server user  |
   |tries to initiate an action on z/OS, the administrator ID    |
   |is used as a key to obtain the corresponding RACF user ID.   |
   |                                                             |
   |Add the following new sentence:                              |
   |At connection time, the WebSphere Application Server         |
   |administrator user will be mapped to the corresponding       |
   |RACF user ID. For this reason it is necessary to map,        |
   |in the parameter library member (specified in the            |
   |USERMAP parameter of the SERVOPT), the WebSphere             |
   |Application Server administrator with a RACF user ID.        |
   |This RACF user ID must not have accesses to particular       |
   |TWS for z/OS resources, but just being defined as            |
   |RACF user.  On the contrary, for any actions performed       |
   |through JSC/TDWC users, the JSC/TDWC users will be           |
   |mapped to the corresponding RACF user ID.                    |
   |Moreover add the following sentence at the bottom of         |
   |the subsection:                                              |
   |                                                             |
   |User IDs involved with Dynamic Workload Console              |
   |or Job Scheduling Console                                    |
   |                                                             |
   |The following example explains how the Tivoli                |
   |administrator ID and the local user ID are related and       |
   |used when WebSphere Application Server connects to           |
   |z/OS Engine:                                                 |
   |-The name of the host on which you run WebSphere Application |
   | Server (zConnector) is Roma1                                |
   |-An administrator named CONWAS1 is defined in Roma1          |
   |-A local user LOCUSR1 is defined in Roma1                    |
   |-The administrator CONWAS1 is associated with local user     |
   | LOCUSR1                                                     |
   |-The controller identifies WebSphere Application Server by   |
   | means of the following user name:                           |
   | USER CONWAS1-AT-ROMA1-REGION RACFUSER (TSUSER)              |
   |                                                             |
   | where TSUSER is the TSO user-ID on which the IBM            |
   | Tivoli Workload Scheduler for z/OS dialog runs.             |
