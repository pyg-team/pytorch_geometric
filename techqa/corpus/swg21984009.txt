PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Image Services re-exporting over 5k docs from IS to P8 using xml file 

SYMPTOM
We recently did an audit between p8 and IS and found we have over 5500
documents that need to be re-exported. I am trying to find a way to
export them in batches using a generated xml file and dropping it in
the export folder. Documentation says that the CE import service is
constantly monitoring this folder for new exports but i have found that
it will not export unless I click "export now" under catalog export.


ENVIRONMENT
Image Services 4.1.2.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Page 596 of the IS 4.1.2 System Tools Reference manual provides guidance for using the INX_export tool to export documents from IS to P8.
