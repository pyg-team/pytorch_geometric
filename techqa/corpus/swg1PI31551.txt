ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have attempted the silent installation of the 32-bit R
   Essentials for SPSS Statistics 22 FP1 (22.0.0.1) on a 64-bit
   Windows operating system. SPSS Staistics 22.0.0.1 on this
   computer is also 32-bit. After completing the installation
   process, it seemed that the R Essential files had not installed.
   I was able to install the essentials using the setup wizard, but
   wish to be able to do a silent install.
   There is a defect in regard to the silent installation of the
   32-bit R Essentilas for SPSS Statistics 22 FP1 on a 64-bit
   operatings system, such that the files are copied to the wrong
   directory. The defect has been filed with Development and is
   being addressed. The work-arounds are to install the R
   Essentials by the installation wizard or instal the 64-bit
   versions of SPSS Statistics 22.0.0.1 and the 64-bit R
   Essentials.
