CAUSE

ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Windows



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the CPIT_Install.log



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 There are two options to resolve this issue: 

 * When renaming the media for CPIT to install, do not add the file type extension.
   
   eg: When renaming Content Engine media (CZS02ML.zip) to ce as per the IBM FileNet P8 documentation:
   
   CZS02ML to ce do not rename as ce.zip if the Microsoft Windows default of hiding known file extensions is enabled, as the file will now be called ce.zip.zip, while Microsoft Windows Explorer will only show the file as ce.zip while hiding the extra .zip as it is a known file extension.
   
   
 * Change the Microsoft Windows behaviour.
   
   1. Windows control panel 
   
   2. Folder Options 
   
   3. Show hidden files and folders 
   
   4. Uncheck, Hide extensions for known file types. 
   
   5. Then take corrective action to give the file the correct name values.
