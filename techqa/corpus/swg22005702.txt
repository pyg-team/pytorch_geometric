Title: IBM Server to Server SSL connection failure - United States

Text:
s2s TSM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why is my Protect STGpool failing on the SSL defined port when Non-SSL sessions work? 

CAUSE
APAR IT19872 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After following the configuration of Self Signed Certificate for Sever To Server communications, (See link "Set up two servers to use SSL to communicate") the Protect STGpool fails with these messages: 

ANR2017I Administrator ADMIN issued command: PROTECT STGPOOL pool_name
ANR0454E Session rejected by server server-name, reason: 201 - Communication Failure. (SESSION: xxxx)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade both Source and Target server to the V8.1.1.0 or above. 


In the reported case, the Source server was at V8.1.0 and the Target server was at V8.1.1.0. The sessions generated from the Target server to the Source server worked as it had the fix. Once both servers were at the fix level, all SSL sessions work both directions.
