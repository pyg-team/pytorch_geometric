CAUSE
The cache directory used by the ViewONE Virtual viewer needs to have RW permissions by the account that starts the application server's JVM. If the permission is changed it can cause problems.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the permissions of the directory (and its sub-directories) defined as the Cache Root for ViewONE Virtual. Make sure the account that is used to start the JVM hosting the ViewONE Virtual viewer has RW permissions to the directories and files.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Correct the permissions of the cache root directory, its sub-directories, and files.
