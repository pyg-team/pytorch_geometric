 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with Statistics 18 and have opened an existing file with a datetime variable which I have created in Statistics 17. My datetime variable is of format: 
dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm
When I open the file everything is displayed properly, however when I would like to enter new datetime values manually into the existing variables this is not possible, the entries are always deleted, why is this? How to enter datetime values manually? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available, see below. We apologize for any inconvenience. It is resolved with the 18.0.1 Patch.
Please note that you must enter the full date format to be properly recognized.

*Workaround if you would like to enter new cases in an existing datetime variable.
* First: extract the date portion into a new variable.

* Date and Time Wizard: date_extract.
COMPUTE date_extract=XDATE.DATE(datetime).
VARIABLE LABELS date_extract.
VARIABLE LEVEL date_extract(SCALE).
FORMATS date_extract(DATE11).
VARIABLE WIDTH date_extract(11).
EXECUTE.

*Second: extract the time portion.
* Date and Time Wizard: Time_extract.
COMPUTE Time_extract=XDATE.TIME(datetime).
VARIABLE LABELS Time_extract.
VARIABLE LEVEL Time_extract(SCALE).
FORMATS Time_extract(TIME8).
VARIABLE WIDTH Time_extract(8).
EXECUTE.

* Now enter your new cases manually and after that combine the two variables back into datetime format:

COMPUTE newdate2=date_extract + time_extract.
EXECUTE.
FORMATS newdate2 (datetime20)
