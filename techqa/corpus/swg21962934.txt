Title: IBM Case Manager Client integrated viewer widget loading closes the right-click context menu - United States

Text:
internal viewer; right click menu TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the integrated internal document viewer loads a default attachment, the IBM Case Manager Client right-click context menu disappears when using Microsoft Internet Explorer 

SYMPTOM
 On the Case Manager Solution Work page with the integrated viewer widget configured to automatically load the default attachment with a right-click action, the right-click context menu disappears and the focus changes to the viewer widget. This is specific to Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE). It does not happen when using Firefox or Chrome.


CAUSE
IE handles the focus functionality at the Java layer differently than Firefox and Chrome.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Case Manager Client and IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 Fix Pack 3 or lower.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was corrected in IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3.4, but requires a configuration change to take effect.




 1. Install ICN 2.0.3 Fix Pack 4 or above. 
 2. Open the IBM Content Navigator Admin desktop (.../?desktop=admin) 
 3. Click on the Daeja ViewOne node, in the left hand column 
 4. In the Additional settings section of the Daeja Viewer settings add InitialFocus and initial_focus with a value of false. 
 5. Save the changes by clicking the "Save" button
