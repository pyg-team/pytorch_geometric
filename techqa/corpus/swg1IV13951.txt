ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows
     Siebel Agent 6.24, image part number CZV4CEN
   Problem Description:
     After installed and configured 6.24 Siebel Agent, two symtoms
      showed
     1. Agent Connection Status is "No" in the Agent Connection
     Status view of the agent's top level workspace in the
     agent's top level workspace in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.
   
   
     2. Examination of the configuration values set in the cfg file
     and those shown in the agent's log file proves that default
     values from the wrong configuration section were used.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
       1. Install the "Monitoring Agent for Siebel" on Windows.
       2. Configure an instance of the Monitoring Agent for Siebel.
           Example:
           Server Type:
               Instance Name: sections
               Server type(s): Siebel server only
           Server Type: Server
               Siebel Enterprise name: SCRM
               Siebel Server name: s80winorac5
               Siebel Server base install directory:
       S:\siebel\siebsrvr
               Siebel Server Admin ID: SADMIN
               Siebel Server Admin password: ******
               Siebel Server software version: version 8.0
               Siebel Gateway Name Server and optional port:
       S:\siebel\gtwysrvr
           Additional logs:
               <Leave all 10 fields blank>
       3. Start the agent instance.
       4. Open the kubsieb log file (example: C:\IBM\ITM\TMAITM6
       \logs\S80WINORAC5_ub_sections_kubsieb_4cc06d37-01.log)
       5. [PROBLEM] Find "KUB_SIEBEL_ENTERPRISE". You should see it
       set to the value "siebel"
       6. Open the configuration file for the agent instance
          (example: C:\IBM\ITM\TMAITM6\s80winorac5_ub_sections.cfg)
       7. Confirm
           a. SERVER_TYPE=SERVER
           b. KUB_SIEBEL_ENTERPRISE=SCRM inside SECTION=KUB_SERVER
              ("SCRM" should have been seen in the log in step 5
              above.)
           c. KUB_SIEBEL_ENTERPRISE=siebel inside
              SECTION=KUB_SERVER_AND_GATEWAY
              (This should NOT have been used unless the
              SERVER_TYPE was
              "SERVER_AND_GATEWAY")
   
   
   Additional Information:
     1. more information is in defect 140524 and technotes
     http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348]
     2. Siebel Agent 6.24 (CZV4CEN) is based on installer 06220200
     3. To recreate the issue Siebel server is not required.
        The following info is from the Agent team
     Q1: Is a Siebel server required to recreate the issue?
         No, if you consider this an ITM Config write defect.
         You can see the error
         in the cfg file after configuration as described in
         http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348]
   
      Q2: If yes, is the Sieble server on the same machine(local)
      as the Siebel agent or remotely on another machine?
      The Siebel agent is a local agent only.
   
      Q3: If local, please ask the Seible Agent team to provide
      test environment with Sieble Server to recreate, debug and
      test Please see the answer to question 1 about not needing
      Siebel server.
      you consider this and ITM Config read defect, then I can work
      on providing access to a Siebel Server, however, can you
      please use the information in
      http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21450348]
      to determine whether is is an ITM Config write or ITM Config
      read defect.
   
   
   
   
   Local Fix:
     Reconfigure the agent instance and configure values for all
     server types that share configuration variables with the
     target server type. Then re-select
     the correct server type and complete the configuration.
   
   
     For example, when configuring for a Siebel server only:
   
       1. Choose "Both Siebel and Gateway server".
       2. Click Next, and fill in all fields that are also used on
          the Siebel server
          only server type (all fields except the Siebel Gateway
          Name Server base install directory>.
       3. Click Back, select "Siebel server only", then complete
          the configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Configuration of an IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for
   Applications Agent for Siebel CRM instance with the server type
   of "Siebel server only" does not work correctly.
   
   
   During agent configuration, the unused server type sections are
   written to the configuration file with default values. When the
   agent is started, some of those default values are used, instead
   of the values from the selected server type section.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Support has been added for agents to specify whether default
   values are used instead of the values from the selected server
   type section. For this to be effective, the Siebel agent needs
   to implement this new setting (see APAR IV19099).
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
   
   | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0009
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Reconfigure the agent instance and configure values for all
   server types that share configuration variables with the target
   server type. Then re-select the correct server type and complete
   the configuration.
   
      For example, when configuring a Siebel server:
   
       1.  Choose "Both Siebel and Gateway server".
       2.  Click Next, and fill in all fields that are also used on
   the "Siebel server only" server type. Excluded the Siebel
   Gateway Name Server base install directory field.
       3.  Click Back and select "Siebel server only", then
   complete the configuration.
