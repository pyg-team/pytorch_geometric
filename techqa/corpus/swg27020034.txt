 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 The topics that describe the required permissions for the Application Engine and Workplace XT installer accounts (ae_install_user and wpxt_install_user) are missing some additional requirements in order to run the Process Engine Client installation program. 

A fix for this issue was applied to the IBM FileNet P8 Version 5.0 information center (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/index.jsp]) on www.ibm.com as of April 25, 2011. 

CONTENT
To update Application Engine or Workplace XT with the Process Engine client installation program, the logon accounts ae_install_user or wpxt_install_usermust have read and write permission to the location where the Process Engine Client will be installed and also to where the Common Files directory will be installed. 

 
If the P8TASKMAN_HOME environment variable exists, you must grant read and write permission to the ../Common Files/taskmaninstances.xml file.

Default location for Common Files for Windows: 
C:\Program Files\IBM\FileNet\Common Files 

Default location for Common Files for UNIX: 
/opt/IBM/FileNet/CommonFiles
