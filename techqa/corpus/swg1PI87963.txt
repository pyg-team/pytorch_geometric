PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V9.0                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Application servers created within an   *
   *                      existing profile are configured with    *
   *                      unexpected default initial and maximum  *
   *                      heap sizes.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using the Administrative Console or administrative
   commands to create a new application server within a
   v9.0 profile, the configuration of the new server unexpetedly
   contains the default initial and maximum heap sizes for
   V8.5.5 rather than V9.0.
   For WebSphere Application Server V9.0, the default initial and
   maximum heap sizes for an Application Server are,
   respectively, 256M and 512M for the Adjunct and Control
   regions; 512M and 1024M for the Servant region.
   When necessary for pre-existing Application Servers, you can
   perform the following procedure to set the initial and maximum
   heap sizes. The procedure applies also to Node Agents and
   Deployment Managers.
   1. In the Administrative Console, select the target server
   to configure.
   For Application Servers
   Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers
   Select the server you want to work with -- for
   example, server1
   For Node Agents
   System Administration > Node Agents
   Select the Node agent you want to work with
   For Deployment Managers
   System Administration > Deployment Manager
   2. On the Configuration tab, under Server Infrastructure,
   expand Java and Process Management, and click Process
   Definition.
   For z/OS the following tasks must be performed for each
   of the regions (Control, Servant, and Adjunct) as applicable
   to each Application Server, Node Agent, and Deployment Manager.
   3. Under the Additional Properties section, click Java
   Virtual Machine.
   4. In the Initial heap size field, enter the initial heap size
   available to the JVM, in megabytes -- for example, 512
   5. In the Maximum heap size field, enter the maximum heap size
   available to the JVM, in megabytes -- for example, 1024
   6. Ensure the Generic JVM Arguments field does not contain JVM
   options that set the initial and maximum memory sizes, -Xms and
   -Xmx.
   7. Apply and Save the changes.
   The new values for the initial and maximal heap sizes are now
   set in the target server configuration.
   8. Restart the target server for the changes to take
   effect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Apply APAR PI87963 to enable the Administrative
   Console and administrative commands to create Application
   Servers configured with the default initial and maximum heap
   sizes for V9.0, specifically:
   
       Region    Initial   Maximum
       ----------------------------
       Control   256 M     512 M
       Adjunct   256 M     512 M
       Servant   512 M     1024 M
