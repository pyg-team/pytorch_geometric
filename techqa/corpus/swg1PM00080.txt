ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a attached a screenshot illustrating the problem (SubStat
   eChartProblem1.jpg).
   
   TopLevelState has been divided into concurrent states. SubStateA
    has a sub-state chart. However, there is no icon indicating tha
   t there is a sub-statechart. SubStateB shows the workaround that
    we have been using. Create an 'intermediate' or 'container' sta
   te, and then create the sub-statechart. The intermediate/contain
   er state does have the icon indicating that a sub-statechart exi
   sts.
   
   As shown in SubStateChartProblem2.jpg, a right-click on the SubS
   tateA shows that the sub-statechart can be accessed, as long as
   the user/reviewer knows that one exists.
   
   
   Also, if a state has a sub-statechart, you cannot draw an And li
   ne on it.
