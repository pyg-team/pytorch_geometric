Title: IBM WebSphere Portal Support Statement Addendum - Unsupported Products - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This list provides information regarding all known "Unsupported Products" as discussed in the IBM WebSphere Portal Support Statement in the version 6.1 Information Center. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. In the absence of an explicit listing of a product and unless told otherwise by the Portal Support team, customers should assume that the status of the product is unknown and that the product may be incompatible with WebSphere Portal. 

CONTENT
For more information regarding earlier versions of WebSphere Portal, refer to document #7007699 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg27007699].


An "Unsupported Product" is a product (at a specified version, release and fix level) that is known to not work with WebSphere Portal and is therefore not supported. A product can be included in this category as a result of an explicit test effort by Portal Development or as a result of discovery from a prior customer problem. This list will be updated as needed to include the most current information available. Status of Unsupported Products is subject to change at any time depending upon development efforts.
The following products are not supported with WebSphere Portal version 6.1. Updates or changes are noted in parentheses following the entries:
