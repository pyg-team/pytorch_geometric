PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to get patch code and other barcode types to be recognized using IBM Datacap Taskmaster results in no barcodes being found. 

SYMPTOM
The rrs logs show something similar to: 

09:00:58.41 (0) t:32C p:51F8B8 Running barcode recognition for the entire page.
09:00:58.57 (16) t:32C p:51F8B8 Attempting to read barcode of type(s) 'CODE 128,Patch Code,'
09:00:58.57 (0) t:32C p:51F8B8 Confidence required (Datacap): 6
09:00:58.57 (0) t:32C p:51F8B8 Confidence required (converted to Barcode Reader confidence range): 61
09:00:58.353 (296) t:32C p:51F8B8 Recognition time: 0.296875
09:00:58.353 (0) t:32C p:51F8B8 0 barcode(s) found.


However, barcode recognition does work when only one type of barcode is selected. 

When a page is configured to have both options chosen, the other barcode types are recognized, but the patch codes are not.


CAUSE
Barcode recognition uses an alternate recognition method to recognize patch codes that is only run if the only specified barcode type is Patch Code.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, do the following:


First, locate the code for the barcode type: 

 1. Open Datacap Studio. 
 2. Go to the Zones tab. 
 3. Lock the DCO. 
 4. Select one of the DCO nodes. 
 5. Under the BAR/P tab, select the only the barcode type to be recognized. Do not select Patch Code. 
 6. Right click on the DCO node previously selected and click Manage variables. 
 7. Make a note of the value under the bp_tp variable.  * For Code 128, the value is 2048. 
     * For Patch Code, the value is 524288.
    
    
 8. Save and unlock the DCO.
    


Next, add the following actions to the GetBarcode ruleset:  1. Go to the GetBarcode ruleset and add the following actions:  * SaveAsCurrentObjVariable () and assign it bp_tp,2048 
     * call GetBarcodeBP() 
     * SaveAsCurrentObjVariable () and assign it bp_tp,524288 
     * call GetBarcodeBP()
    
    
 2. Repeat for any other barcode types that need to be detected.
