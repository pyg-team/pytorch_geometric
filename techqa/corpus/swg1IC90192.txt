APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Manage EPVs" page in the Process Admin console
   displays multiple entries for each Snapshot.
   
   Listing the snapshot multiple times is confusing as it
   leads to the question of which snapshot should be selected
   for the value to take effect or does it even really matter.

   ****************************************************************
   The "Manage EPVs" page in the Process Admin console
   displays multiple entries in 'select snapshot' dropdown for each
   Snapshot. This issue is multiplied by the number of Exposed BPDs
   that exist within the snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Active snapshot list is generated from Snapshot List which
   contains two values Snapshot value and Exposed BPD value. If
   Snapshot contains more than one BPD exposed then Snapshot value
   gets duplicated in Snapshot list.
   
   To resolve this issue, we have added Duplicate check while
   generating active snapshot list.
