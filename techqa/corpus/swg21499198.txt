QUESTION
 How to install Tivoli Directory Server V6.2 and its components on AIX 7.1 / AIX 6.1 (Power 7 processor based system) 

CAUSE
Installation of Tivoli Directory Server V6.2 on AIX 7.1 / AIX 6.1 (Power 7 processor based system) using the InstallShield GUI is not supported. The java used by the InstallShield GUI is an older version and is not supported on AIX 7.1 / AIX 6.1 (Power 7 processor based system). If the InstallShield GUI install is attempted it will end abruptly and generate java core file.

ANSWER
Native or Operating system provided methods must be used via the command line to install TDS V6.2 on AIX 7.1 / AIX 6.1 (Power 7 processor based system). InstallShield GUI installation of TDS V6.2 on AIX 7.1 / AIX 6.1 (Power 7 processor based system) is not supported.

     - Download the AIX filesets gskta.rte (32 bit GSKit) and gsksa.rte (64 bit GSKit).
     - scp/ftp(binary) copy the above files to the aix system and keep them in a separate folder. 
 8.  Download the latest recommended level of embedded WebSphere Application server by referring to 6.2 table of "Recommended fixes for Tivoli Directory Server - Version 6.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27009778#ver62]".
     - The minimum required eWAS level to support AIX 7.1 is 6.1.0.29. 
 9.  Install DB2 (downloaded in step 2 above) as the root user. Use the "db2_install" command to install "ESE" (enterprise server edition). Document for yourself the db2 install path (to be used in step 10). Refer to TDS info center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v2r1/index.jsp?toc=/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc/toc.xml] or DB2 info center [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Documentation/Software/Information_Management/DB2_for_Linux,_UNIX_and_Windows] for detailed documentation. 
 10. Install the corresponding DB2 fix pack (downloaded in step 6 above) as the root user. Use "installFixPack" command with -b <db2_install_path>. Where <db2_install_path> is where db2 is installed during step 9 above. 
 11. Install the GSKit 7.0.4.14 (downloaded in step 3 above) as the root user. Refer GSKit V7 install instructions for AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443436]. 
 12. Upgrade the GSKit to latest recommended GSKIt 7.0.4.nn level (downloaded in step 7 above) as the root user. Refer to GSKit V7 upgrade instructions for AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443436]. 
 13. Install TDS V6.2 GA/base images (downloaded in step 1 above) as the root user. Use instructions below:
     ==> cd <path>/tdsV6.2/tdsfiles/ # the tar file was extracted in <path>.

     ==> cd <path>/tdsV6.2/entitlement/
     ==> installp -acXgYd . idsldap 
 14. Install latest recommended fix level for TDS V6.2 (downloaded in step 5 above) as the root user. Use instructions in associated fix README file. Quick steps:
     ==> cd <path>/6.2.0*-TIV-ITDS-AIX-* # use the correct fix folder name.
     ==> ./idsinstall -u 
 15. Install embedded WebSphere Application Server (downloaded in step 4 above) as the root user. Use instructions below:
     ==> cd <path>/tdsV6.2/appsrv/ # the tar file was extracted in <path>.
     ==> install.sh -installRoot /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.2/appsrv # recommended 
 16. Upgrade embedded WebSphere Application Server (downloaded in step 8 above) as the root user. Refer: Fix Pack install procedure for embedded WebSphere Application Server (provided by Tivoli Directory Server) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404270]. 
 17. Deploy Tivoli Directory Server V6.2 Web Administration Tool into the embedded WebSphere Application Server as the root user. Note that at this time eWAS is at latest fix level as well as the TDS provided IDSWebApp.war file also at the latest fix level. Use instructions below:
     ==> cd /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.2/idstools
     ==> ./deploy_IDSWebApp


That completes all the required installation for TDS V6.2. Note that the instance creation and configuration are separate from installation and must be completed to use TDS V6.2 server. 

Now you can proceed to the instance creation and configuration. Refer to slides 95 and later from the TDS V6.2 Intro STE [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015361] for further steps.
