 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Consider ifix installation of 5261_2, it requires the IBM Installation Manager that was used previously to install 5261. The new iFix response file for upgrade of ifix 5261_2 has no siLocation variable, and it relies on the Package or Profile of 5261 registered with IIM. However, IIM allows the package to be un-installed, so that action would leave 5261 intact on the file system, but will remove the registry of the B2Bi package installed previously. In that case, one will not be able to patch 5261 to 5261_2. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following items SHOULD NOT be deleted after IBM Sterling B2B Integrator is installed using IBM Installation Manager (IIM):
¥ IIM - If IIM is deleted, all the details of the installation is lost and leaves IBM Sterling B2B Integrator in an orphaned state. There are no simple ways to get IBM Sterling B2B Integrator application registered back using IM.
¥ Packages in IIM - If the IIM packages are deleted, it deletes the registration details with IIM. For example, one cannot create a vertical cluster of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator, if old packages are deleted.
