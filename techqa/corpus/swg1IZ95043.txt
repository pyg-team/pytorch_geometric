PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Linux OS Agent support for LPAR and Steal CPU metrics.
   
   A new set of attributes and a new workspace have been added to
   the Linux OS Agent to support LPAR and Steal CPU metrics.  LPAR
   support includes collecting metrics such as entitlement,
   capacity weight, and shared pool idle time for the LPAR.  This
   attribute group is only supported for Linux PPC on P5 or greater
   with the following minimum OS versions: RHEL 5.2 and SLES 10sp2.
   
   A new attribute, Steal CPU (Percent), has been added to the CPU
   attribute group which represents the time spent in involuntary
   wait by the virtual CPU while the hypervisor is servicing
   another virtual processor.  This attribute is only supported for
   Linux PPC on P5 or greater with the following minimum OS
   versions: RHEL 5.2 and SLES 10sp2.
   
   The following Technote contains more information on the details
   of the attributes and workspace added to the agent for this
   support:
