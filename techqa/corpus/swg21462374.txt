QUESTION
 Why is the port 50006 for IBM Tivoli Directory Server not being used after middleware installation? 

CAUSE
Port 50006 is not being used after middleware installation.

ANSWER
The port 50006 is not required to install IBM Tivoli Directory Server because it connects to the database locally. You do not have to specify the port while creating the DB2 instance. This port will not impact IBM Tivoli Directory Server functionality. It will not be associated on services.
