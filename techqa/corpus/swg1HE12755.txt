APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This problem was reported ICC 4.0.1.2 .
   
   The problem occurs when the end user creates two identical
   backend P8 connection sets (the only difference is P8 connection
   names, e.g., connection_1 and connection_2). Both connections
   points to the  same FileNet P8 repository/Object Store and use
   the same credential when specifying P8 connection in ICC
   Configuration Manager.
   
   In this scenario, one needs to use connection_1 to
   archive/ingestion and same connection_1 to view  OR connection_2
   to archive/ingestino and same  connection_2 to view (no cross).
   When trying to use connection_1 to archive and connection_2 to
   view (cross), it does not work. The functionality seems to be
   broken.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem has been fixed starting with IBM Content Collector
   4.0.1 Fix Pack 8.
   It is now possible to configure multiple P8 connections pointing
   to the same FileNet P8 repository and same Object Store using
   different ports. One can use cross connections for
   archival/ingestion and view purpose. To avail this feature, add
   the system environment variable AFU_DISABLE_REPOSITORY_DETECTION
   and set its value to 1.
