APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAMfWAS 6.2 FP3 IF 12 + fixes, TEMA 6.2 FP3 IF10, TEPS 6.2.
   Our gc logs are named jvmname_0x_native_stderr.log.  At
   midnight, a log
   archiver process runs and the logs get dev\nulled
   (>jvmname_0x_native_stderr.log).  This process seems to break
   TEMA
   reporting of Garbage Collection Analysis (Times, Objects Freed,
   Objects
   Moved, etc. are reported as 0.  If the jvm is bounced after the
   logs
   are archived, GC data gets reported until midnight the next
   night.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The ITCAM file that has the fix is tk_runtime.jar in
   <DC_HOME>/toolkit/lib/ext directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue arises when the verbose GC log file is emptied either
   by explicitly editing and deleting the contents (Windows) or by
   "cat /dev/null > verboseGCFile" on UNIX systems. Users who have
   an automated script to do this process will be affected by this.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is applicable to distributed platforms and not for Z/OS
   or MVS systems. It is also NOT applicable when the verbose GC
   file rollover is specified using -Xverbosegclog:<path
   to file><filename, X, Y> (multiple file envirionment).
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Not empty the verbose GC file and set it for rollover to
   multiple files to control the file size.
