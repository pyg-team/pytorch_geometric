Title: IBM New file transfer job type fails with AWKRAA207E - United States

Text:
AWKRAA207E; AWSITA118E; IOWrappedException; delimiter; AWSITA032E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The AWKRAA207E error message means that there was an issue handling the job definition on the dynamic agent. 

SYMPTOM
JobManager_message.log entry: 

"AWSITA006I The job with ID "NC_1#JOBS.TAT_860_2.JNUM-840592057" was successfully created. 

AWSITA032E The job with ID "NC_1#JOBS.TAT_860_2.JNUM-840592057" failed to start. The error is "AWKRAA207E The EMF framework is not initialized properly while starting Java Job.". 

AWSITA118E A Java Exception occurred while running job "NC_1#JOBS.TAT_860_2.JNUM-840592057". com.ibm.scheduling.exception.OperationFailedException: AWKRAA207E The EMF framework is not initialized properly while starting Java Job.

TWS/ITA/cpa/ita/native.out entry: 

"osgi> <DATE> com.ibm.scheduling.agent.core.jobexecutor.LocalJobExecutorManager executeJob
SEVERE: AWKRAA207E The EMF framework is not initialized properly while starting Java Job.
Throwable occurred: org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource$IOWrappedException: The reference to entity "that" must end with the ';' delimiter.

..."


CAUSE
The above symptoms include the last four characters of the remote user's password within this statement:
"The reference to entity "that" must end with the ';' delimiter."

The remote user's password has an ampersand "&" character as the character before the last four characters. When the password is decrypted by the agent the ampersand character is not properly handled and this causes a parse issue for the job definition. 


ENVIRONMENT
Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) v8.6 base code level.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Change the passwords used for local and remote users in the file transfer job type, update the job definition with the new passwords, then resubmit the job. If the above symptoms are not returned then the ampersand character caused the issue.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the latest FixPack to the TWS v8.6 instance or modify local and remote passwords for file transfer jobs so that no ampersand characters are used.
