Leap second TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Would the Object Server be affected by the extra leap second on June 30th, 2015? 

ANSWER
OMNIbus uses the gettimeofday() function call, however there have been no known issues caused by operating system time adjustments. 

External programs that modify system time should use adjtime() or adjtimex() system calls. These calls adjust time gradually rather than a sudden change. If these calls are used there would be no chance of negative time increments.
