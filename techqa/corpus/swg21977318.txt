QUESTION
 How can I increase the session timeout value for IBM InfoSphere MDM Collaboration Server User Interface 

CAUSE
During time intensive item or category insert / update work it may happen that the session times out and unsafed work is lost. The message window that pops up when this happens shows: 

 * 
 * 
 * "Your session times-out in 0 minutes. Would you like to reset your session with the server ?"
 * 

ANSWER
You need to increase the value in $TOP/etc/default/common.properties for following parameter: 

 * 
 * max_inactive_interval=1800
 * 


The max_inactive_interval parameter specifies the inactive session duration in seconds. By default it is set to 1800 (30 minutes). 
The server needs to be restarted so the new setting is used
