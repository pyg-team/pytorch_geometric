ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Allow V710 queue-manager backwards migration from V900.
   
   Coexistence with a V900 queue-manager in a queue-sharing group
   is enabled by PI19721 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI19721]: BACKWARDS MIGRATION FROM V8 AND
   COEXISTENCE WITH V8.
   
   Additional backwards migration information is documented in the
   IBM Knowledge Center at
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enable backward migration to version    *
   *                      7.1.0 after a queue manager has been    *
   *                      started with the version 9.0.0 code.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   PTFs for the backward migration APAR must be applied on version
   7 queue managers prior to attempting fallback from IBM MQ for
   z/OS version 9.0.0.
   
   Attempting to restart a queue manager, which has been run with
   version 9.0.0 libraries, at version 7 without this PTF will
   result in abnormal termination of the queue manager with
   ABEND5C6 reason code 00C90D01.
   
   The MQ for z/OS ISPF administration panels, CSQOREXX, are not
   updated by this APAR. The version 9.0.0 CSQOREXX application is
   able to connect to and administer version 7.1.0 queue managers
   and you are advised to use either version 9.0.0 panels, or those
   at the same level as your queue manager during the period of
   migration.
   
   When reverting to Version 7.1.0 after running a queue manager at
   version 9.0.0 backward migration needs to tolerate the new
   capabilities introduced in both Version 8.0.0 and Version 9.0.0
   and the following should be considered:
   
   - New object attributes introduced in Version 8.0.0 will not be
     present in Version 7.1.0, and when you subsequently migrate to
     Version 9.0.0 they will be reset to default values.
     Note, there are no new attributes introduced in Version 9.0.0.
   
   - If you are using the MQ Explorer to administer your queue
     manager then after migration between releases the following
     Explorer actions must be performed:
     1: Remove the migrated z/OS queue manager
     2: Add Remote Queue Manager
   
   - AUTHINFO objects with AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) will be deleted on
     backward migration. Any QSGDISP(GROUP) AUTHINFO objects with
     AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) will be invisible to a Version 7.1.0 queue
     manager in a mixed Version 9.0.0 and Version 7.1.0 queue
     sharing group.
   
   - TOPIC objects with CLROUTE(TOPICHOST) attribute set will be
     deleted on backward migration. Any QSGDISP(GROUP) TOPIC
     objects having CLROUTE(TOPICHOST) attribute set are hidden
     from a Version 7.1.0 queue manager in a mixed Version 9.0.0
     and Version 7.1.0 queue sharing group.
   
   - Proxy subscriptions created on behalf of remote subscribers
     for TOPICs defined with CLROUTE(TOPICHOST) attribute will be
     deleted when the TOPIC object is removed on backwards
     migration.
   
   - When there are subscribers on the queue manager being backward
     migrated, for TOPICs defined with CLROUTE(TOPICHOST) on
     different queue managers, the proxy subs for these subscribers
     will be left on the queue managers hosting the topic. The
     local subscriber will continue to receive publications. If the
     queue manager hosting the TOPIC is also backwards migrated,
     then the proxy subs will be deleted. These subscriptions can
     be identified by issuing DISPLAY SUB(SYSTEM.PROXY_2*)
     SUBTYPE(PROXY) on the remote host queue managers and looking
     for subscriptions with a DESTQMGR matching the local queue
     manager which is being backwards migrated. They can then be
     deleted as for any administrative subscription using the
     DELETE SUB command.
