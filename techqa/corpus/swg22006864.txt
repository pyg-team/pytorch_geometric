Title: IBM Collect history Queue and Application statistics - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I get history for Queue statistics and Application statistics data? 

ANSWER
There are a couple of things you need to do to get history for Queue Statistics and Application Statistics data: 

1)Turn on history configuration for proper attribute group.

Use "History Collection Configuration" at TEP to turn on history for the following attribute groups:
"Queue Long-Term History" for Queue Statistics history
"Application Long-Term History" for Application Statistics history

Some unrelated information: 

 * "Application Accounting" is a distributed only table. 
 * "MQ Queue Statistics" is a distributed only table. 
 * "Message Statistics" returns history data related to situations against "Message Statistics". 
 * "Queue Data" returns on-demand queue data (Real-Time Queue Data
   workspace). 

Note: If you turn on "Queue Long-Term History" you do not need history for "Queue Data" since it is redundant data.

The naming conventions of our tables and how they relate to the
workspaces can be a bit confusing. Refer to "A mapping table for
attribute groups and historical workspaces" in the WebSphere MQ
Monitoring Agent Users Guide for some additional information.

2)Specify HISTORY(YES) in &rhilev.&rte.RKANCMDU(KMQSTART)

Change this value to HISTORY(YES) so that sampled data is written out to history. Since "Queue Long-Term History" and "Application Long-Term History" are sampled attribute groups, HISTORY(YES) is needed for data to be returned by the agent. Parmgen KMQ_HISTCOLL_DATA_FLAG.

HISTORY(YES|NO)
Defines whether historical data is collected for attribute groups whose data is sampled by the agent. Set it to YES to collect historical data.
On distributed systems and z/OS systems, the value that is configured automatically during the installation and configuration process is NO.
