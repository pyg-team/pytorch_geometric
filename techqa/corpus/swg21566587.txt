Title: IBM Tips to manage the ccm_root password in IBM Rational Synergy 7.x - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I need to change the ccm_root password, used by IBM Rational Synergy and/or IBM Rational Change. What steps should I follow? 

CAUSE
In most cases ccm_root's password should be changed using IBM Rational Directory Server (RDS). However, in some specific administration use cases, other steps need to be taken.

ANSWER
IMPORTANT NOTE: All the information below is redundant to the IBM Rational Synergy manual [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rsdp/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.help.download.synergy.doc/pdf71/ag_u.pdf] and is intended to gather all perspectives of the question into a more practical approach, not as a comprehensive guide. 

To change the ccm_root user password, it really depends on:


 * where this user is stored 
 * where the user is used.



The following is an explanation of where the ccm_root user could be potentially be used and how to change the password: 


1. If you use either the Synergy Classic Client or the "new" Synergy client in Traditional mode  * 
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ccmadm password /admin_user
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

2. If you use Synergy in Web Mode  * 
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
   http://<SYNERGY_SERVER>:<PORT>/user
   
 * 
 * 
 * 

3. If you also have Rational Change installed  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A.
 *  If ccm_root is NOT the local admin user for Change
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * B.
 *  If ccm_root IS the local admin user for Change
   
 * 

4. If Change's " backend session user" is ccm_root  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

5. Refreshing the backend sessions  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   * Use the command "ccmdb refresh" to refresh the backend sessions (see Synergy manual for more details) 
    * Because of the complexity of shared backend sessions, especially in Web Mode, this might not be enough. I that case restart Synergy's Web server: 
      
      ccm_server -stop
      ccm_server -start
      
      
   
   

6. If ESD is enabled  * 
 * 
 * In that situation the password for ccm_root is stored on server side in an encrypted file, so that the backend sessions for the users can be started automatically without them requiring to know the ccm_root password. 
 * You need to make sure the ccm_root OS password is properly cached by Synergy. 
 * To do so : 
 *  
   1. Log onto the server as ccm_root 2. Run this command: ccm set_password
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * setting up ccm set_password
 * 
 *
