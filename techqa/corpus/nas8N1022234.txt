Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 ISC BIND is vulnerable to several security vulnerabilities. IBM i has addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3142 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3142]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error when an attacker can send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name. By sending a specially crafted request packet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass TSIG authentication on AXFR requests and transfer the target zone.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127901 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127901] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3143 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3143]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error when an attacker can send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass TSIG authentication and manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127902 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127902] for the current score
