DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors. 
CVSS Base Score: 6.5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120863 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120863] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-5547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5547] 
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service resulting in a low availability impact using unknown attack vectors. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183] 
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack. 
CVSS Base Score: 3.7

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase, versions 7.1, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.0.1 and 9.0 in the following components:


 * CCRC WAN server/CM Server component, when configured to use SSL 
 * ClearCase remote client: CCRC/CTE GUI, rcleartool, and CMAPI clients, when using SSL to access a CCRC WAN Server/CM Server

ClearCase version Status 9.0.1, 9.0.1.1 Not Affected 9.0 through 9.0.0.4 Affected 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.14 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Affected 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.19 (all fix packs) Affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to install a fix that includes an updated Java™ Virtual Machine with fixes for the issues, and to apply fixes for WebSphere Application Server (WAS).

CCRC Client fixes 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Affected Versions Applying the fix 9.0 through 9.0.0.4 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 5 (9.0.0.5) for 9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043920] or install Rational ClearCase release 9.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043585] 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.14 
   8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 15 (8.0.1.15) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043918] 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.19 (all fix packs) Customers should upgrade to a fixed, supported version/release of the product. 
 * 
 * Notes:
 *  If you use CCRC as an extension offering installed into an Eclipse shell (one not provided as part of a ClearCase release), or you use rcleartool or CMAPI using a Java™ Virtual Machine not supplied by IBM as part of Rational ClearCase, you should update the Java™ Virtual Machine that you use to include a fix for the above issues. Contact the supplier of your Java™ Virtual Machine and/or the supplier of your Eclipse shell. 

CCRC WAN server fixes  *  Determine the WAS version used by your CCRC WAN server. Navigate to the CCRC profile directory (either the profile you specified when installing ClearCase, or <ccase-home>/common/ccrcprofile), then execute the script: bin/versionInfo.sh (UNIX) or bin\versionInfo.bat (Windows). The output includes a section "IBM WebSphere Application Server". Make note of the version listed in this section. Review the following WAS security bulletin:

   [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982223]and apply the latest available fix for the version of WAS used for CCRC WAN server. 
 *  Note: there may be newer security fixes for WebSphere Application Server. Follow the link below (in the section "Get Notified about Future Security Bulletins") to subscribe to WebSphere product support alerts for additional Java SDK fixes. 
 *  Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.0.x
   8.0.1.x
   9.0.0.x Apply the appropriate WebSphere Application Server fix directly to your CCRC WAN server host. No ClearCase-specific steps are necessary. 7.1.2.x (all fix packs)
   7.1.1.x (all fix packs)
   7.1.0.x (all fix packs) Customers should upgrade to a fixed, supported version/release of the product. 

For 7.0, 7.1, 7.1.1 and earlier releases, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
