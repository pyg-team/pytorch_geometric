QUESTION
 JDBC Gateway : Which JDBC Driver is best to use? 

CAUSE
JDBC Driver versions are linked to Java versions

ANSWER
 

The choice of JDBC Driver is determined by the version of Java being used by the Netcool/OMNIbus installation. Please refer to your database vendors documentation when deciding which driver to use with the JDBC gateway. 

 

For your reference, the currently available JDBC 3.0 and 4.0 drivers are:
Oracle 10g drivers are:
classes12.jar - use with Java 1.2 and 1.3
ojdbc14.jar - use with Java 1.4 and 1.5

Oracle 11g drivers are:
ojdbc5.jar - use with Java 1.5
ojdbc6.jar - use with Java 1.6


Sybase JDBC drivers are:
jconn3.jar - use with Java 1.6

The jTDS JDBC Driver is Java independent:
jTDS is an open source 100% pure Java (type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver for Microsoft SQL Server (6.5, 7, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012) and Sybase (10, 11, 12, 15). 

DB2 JDBC Drivers are:
db2jcc.jar - use Java 1.4.2 or later. 
db2jcc4.jar - use Java, 6 or later.
