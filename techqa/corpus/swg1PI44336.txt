   ****************************************************************
   An EXEC CICS SIGNON with OIDCARD and no PASSWORD is being
   issued. It is processed in DFHUSAD including validating the
   password and adding the user to the user domain. DFHUSAD
   doesn't check whether a password has actually been supplied
   before trying to validate it. The password validation process
   is failed as no password is provided. It correspondingly causes
   the SIGNON request to fail with NOTAUTH response.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  UI24130  UI24127  UI25263  UI22616  UI25262  UI22618
   DFHUSAD has been changed to make sure the SIGNON with OIDCARD
   and no PASSWORD can be correctly processed.
