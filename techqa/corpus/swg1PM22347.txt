ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Exporting a full set of structures in 8.5.1 generates an Out Of
   Memory exception, I have tested the exact same database in
   8.4FP1 in which the export completes without errors. Selecting
   roughly half of the forms and exporting the structures twice
   will let the export run through successfully, and can be used as
   a workaround.??I have looked at the memory consumption on the
   server and the client, it's not immediately visible where the
   out of memory exception occurs (client or server, but the only
   errors that are logged is on the client, which suggests that the
   exception occurs on the client:??Event Type:?Warning?Event
