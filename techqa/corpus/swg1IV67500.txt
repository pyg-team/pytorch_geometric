APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Assets application, the user has the option to move an
   Asset using many parameters, for instance "To Site", To
   Location", "To Parent" and "TO Glaccount"
   
   In the MIF, the processing class is only sensitive for Location
   and Parent changes. If the user chooses to change only the
   GLACCOUNT, the Asset is not moved.  But if the users changes
   both Location and GL Account, the Asset is moved and the new GL
   Account is set.
   
   Basically, a change on TLOAMNEWGLACCOUNT is not recognized by
   itself.
   
   The processing class must be changed to make the
   TLOAMNEWGLACCOUNT sensitive for changes and call the MBO
   methods.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Go to > Integration > Object Structures > MXASSET
   Select Action > Exclude / Include fields
   
   Make sure the Non-Persistent TLOAMNEWGLACCOUNT is added to the
   schema.
   
   Save
   
   Go to > Integration > External System > ExtSys1 > Enterprise
   Services Tab
   Pick up the MXASSETInterface
   Create a CSV file and Import the Sample below:
   
   EXTSYS1,MXASSETInterface,AddChange
   ASSETNUM,AS_SITEID,MOVEMEMO,TLOAMNEWGLACCOUNT,NEWORGID,AS_LOCATI
   ON
   1002,BEDFORD,Changing GL Account,6000-200-000,EAGLENA,MOFLOOR2
   
   
   Make sure the value on TLOAMNEWGLACCOUNT is different from the
   current Asset GL Account value.
