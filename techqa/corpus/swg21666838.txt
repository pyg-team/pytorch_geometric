 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Documents are not synchronized to the device when Daylight Saving Time (DST) start/end if DSTLaw is not set in Notes.ini on IBM i.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is mandatory to set DSTLaw=3,2,1,11,1,1 (the value for DSTLaw is just an example here, set to the correct value according to your timezone and DST information) in Notes.ini on IBM i platform since the DST rule changed from 2007 in USA. 

Additional information 

The following information provides a checklist of the changes that needed to be made for all IBM i Domino installations, for the 2007 DST rule change. Additional updates may be required for your particular environment:
