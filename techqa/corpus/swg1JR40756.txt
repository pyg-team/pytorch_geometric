APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCA calls that go from Aysnc to Sync components are not
   properly tracked by Service Monitor. The Cross Component Trace
   call chains are also not properly handled.  The SCA Observer
   Framework needs to properly handle this Async to Sync
   transition.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SCA Calls are missing from Service      *
   *                      Monitor or Server Logs View.            *

   *                  synchronous calls do not always show up     *

   *                  Component Trace.  Apply this fix to solve   *
   *                  the problem.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   There is a switch from Async to Sync that can happen when
   multiple modules are involved. For example: Module A has a
   BPEL component and makes an async call to module B. Module B
   is a Mediation Flow Component and calls Module C. Module C is
   a pojo and supports Sync calls.
   SCA will call from BPEL to MFC using Async, then switch to
   Sync when calling from MFC to the POJO.
   This Async to Sync switch will be lost to SCA Observer
   Framework and will thus impact any function that relies on the
   SCA Observer Framework: Service Monitor, Server Logs View,
   Tivoli integration.
   Another way to verify that this is the customer's problem is by
   changing the perferred interaction to Async for all imports.
   This will cause the SCA Observer Framework to work correctly.
   This defects only affects SCA Observer Framework and function
   that uses the SCA Observer Framework.  The SCA calls work
   properly, they are just not reported properly by the SCA
   Observer Framework.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The async to sync transition is now checked for in the code
   and handled by the SCA Observer Framework.
