Text:
dbexport; 201; unldobj; reserved TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to export a database with the DBexport utility I receive a 201 error while trying to export the schema of a certain table. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 
Q. 

Why is it that I receive this 201 error when I try to export a database using the dbexport utility:

*** prepare unldobj
201 - A syntax error has occurred.

A. 

One cause of this error is the use of a reserved word in either one of the column names or the table name itself.

For further details on reserved words, refer to the IBM Informix Dynamic Server Guide to SQL Syntax .
