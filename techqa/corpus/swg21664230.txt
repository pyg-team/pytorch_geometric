Title: IBM Installation Manager hangs when attempting to apply Modeler 16.0 Adapters to a C&DS 6.0 environment. - United States

Text:
C&DS adapters modeler adapter install failed out of memory java.lang.OutOfMemoryError Java heap space websphere jboss wsadmin.bat installation jvm java virtual machine CNDS 6.0 CADS 6.0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 C&DS 6.0 is installed on RHEL 6.4 Open Client. WebSphere 8.5 is the Application Server and DB2 10.1 is the Repository database. The Modeler 16.0 Adapters were downloaded and extracted to a temp directory. Installation Manager was launched and a repository was define within File | Preferences to point to the temp directory that housed the Modeler 16.0 Adapter install files (specifically the diskTag.inf file within disk1). The installation of the adapters was started and the C&DS install was selected as the target. However, after 2 hours, Installation Manager continued to display the same message:

"Starting deployment proces (This may take a while)"

The install never finished. 

SYMPTOM
Within the packageManager_ant.log, the following message was seen repeatedly every 30 or 60 seconds: 

java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences syncWorld
WARNING: Couldn't flush user prefs: java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException: Couldn't get file lock.


CAUSE
This appears to be a memory problem with the wsadmin utility that is used to deploy C&DS to WebSphere. The default memory settings for the wsadmin.sh command was set to the following: 


-Xms256m -Xmx256m



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Cancel/close out of the current Installation Manager session. Increase the Max Memory setting (Xmx) for the wsadmin utility located within WebSphers home for example ../Websphere/Appserver/bin/wsadmin.bat 


set PERFJAVAOPTION=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -Xj9 -Xquickstart


Then run the cliAdapterInstaller.sh utility again found within the <C&DS_Install>\bin directory. 

This utility will prompt for a validation to install packages again and for the C&DS 'admin' user credentials. When it completes it will return to the command prompt - no message is returned.
