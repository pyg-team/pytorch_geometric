Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects Build Forge (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects Build Forge. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue. 
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for current source
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
BuildForge Versions: 7.1.2, 7.1.2.1, 7.1.2.2, 7.1.2.3, 7.1.3, 7.1.3.1, 7.1.3.2, 7.1.3.3, 7.1.3.4, 7.1.3.5, 7.1.3.6, 8.0, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Use the following configuration to disable RC4. 

Apache: Configure ssl.conf under buildforge_installpath/server/apache/conf/ssl/ssl.conf
Add !RC4 to disable RC4 and remove any lines that explicitly enable RC4, for example:
i.e. old 

SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLV3:!EXPORT 

new 

SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLV3:!EXPORT 

update Bfclient.conf change the cipher group lines as following 

# OpenSSL configuration bf_ssl_cipher_group=ALL:!ADH:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLV3:!EXPORT
# JSSE configuration
bf_ssl_cipher_group=ALL:!ADH:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLV3:!EXPORT
