QUESTION
 What licence keys do you need for IBM® Rational® Business Developer (RBD) versions 7.0 or 7.1 with Enterprise Generation Language (EGL)? 

ANSWER
The license keys that you need, depend on the RBD version. 

Version 7.1
The 7.1 version of RBD is a stand-alone product. RBD contains all the necessary components of RAD, therefore no base product is required. Only the RBD license key is needed. 


Version 7.0 

The following keys in the IBM Rational License Key Center after installing RBD: 

 * IBM Rational Business Developer, 
 * IBM Rational Business Developer Extension (RBDe), 
 * IBM Rational Developer on System i for Service-oriented architecture (SOA).


RBDe version 7.0 is an extension to a base product. The underlying base products are 

 * IBM Rational Application Developer, 
 * IBM Rational Developer for z Series, 
 * IBM Websphere Development Studio Client (WDSC), 
 * IBM Rational Software Architect.
