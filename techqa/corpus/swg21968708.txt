(JDBCTask.java:329)


CAUSE
Cause 1: The version of the jar file being used (JDBC 4.1 and 4.2) could not connect to the database.

Cause 2: You are not using Apache Derby for your database. The JDBC jar was not in the correct directory prior to installation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Solution 1: Use version 4.0 of the JDBC jar. 


Solution 2: When installing UrbanCode Deploy and not using Apache Derby, you need to include the JDBC jar for your database in the \lib\ext directory as specified in the knowledge center topic Installing the server in interactive mode [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.3/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/server_install_interactive.html].
