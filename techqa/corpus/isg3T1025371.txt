 What is a Customer Replaceable Unit?

A: Some parts of IBM Machines are designated as Customer Replaceable Units [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1025363#C] (called "CRUs"). Examples are keyboards, memory, or hard disk drives. IBM will ship CRUs to you for you to install. CRUs are designated as being either a Tier 1 (mandatory) CRU or a Tier 2 (optional) CRU. All CRUs are designed to be installed by customers but Tier 1 CRUs are easier to install than Tier 2 CRUs. Installation of a Tier 1 CRU is your responsibility. If IBM installs a Tier 1 CRU at your request, you will be charged for the installation. You may install a Tier 2 CRU yourself or request IBM to install it, at no additional charge, under the type of warranty service designated for you Machine. If IBM instructs you to return the replaced CRU, you are responsible for returning it to IBM in accordance with IBM's instructions. If you do not return the defective CRU, if IBM so instructs, within 15 days of your receipt of the replacement CRU IBM may charge you for the replacement.

 What is a Field Replaceable Unit?

 Can I keep the defective part that is being replaced?

A: No, the parts IBM or your reseller replaces become its property and the replacement parts become yours.
