 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to run a report directly in Excel or PDF from Query Studio instead of running it in HTML first then selecting Excel or PDF output method. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is not possible due to its interactive nature but the default output method can be set when the report is saved and run from within Cognos Connection.

Steps:  1. Go to where the report is saved in Cognos Connection and click on the "Set Properties" button (or click "More..." and then click Set Properties). 
 2. Click on the "Query" tab. 
 3. Change the "Default Action" to "Run the report"
 4. Check the "Override the default values" button. This will offer the option to specify the default format. 
 5. Select the desired output format and click OK
