APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When setting timeout.resume.session=true in
   ConfigService.properties, Portal does not show an error message
   after a session timeout but creates a new session "on the fly".
   This is, in general, working fine.
   
   The problem appears only if the first request after the session
   timeout is a portlet action request
   containing POST parameters. In this case the portlet action is
   executed, but without the corresponding POST parameters.
   
   The SessionValidator does a Redirect without passing the POST
   parameters to the new URL. This way the paramters are lost.
   
   This APAR substitutes PK63445 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK63445].
