APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Developer for System z V9.1.1, while remote
   debugging a CICS program, the debugger issues
   the following AQEDB0003E message indicating the program listing
   is not found. As a results, the COBOL
   source is not available and the disassembly of the program is
   displayed in the Debug Perspective
   for stepping.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: 01.Debug users who have ASA control          *
   *                    characters in their listings.             *
   *                 02.Debug users who have null characters in   *
   *                    their listings or source.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.When debugging, no local variables   *
   *                         are available for the selected       *
   *                         stack while debugging.               *
   *                      02.During a debug session users         *
   *                         incorrectly see AQEDB0003E which     *
   *                         indicates the listing or source      *
   *                         cannot be found.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.When debugging COBOL V4, where the listings include ASA
      control characters, the debugger is unable to determine the
      local variables.
   02.When a listing or source contains null characters, the
      Integrated Debugger is unable to correctly process it,
      resulting in message AQEDB0003E which indicated the listing
      cannot be found. As a result, disassembly of the program is
      displayed in the debug editor for stepping.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The Integrated Debugger engine was updated to correctly
      process the ASA control characters in listings.
   02.The Integrated Debugger engine was updated to correctly
      process null characters in listings or source.
