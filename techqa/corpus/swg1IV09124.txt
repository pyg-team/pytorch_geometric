PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users wanting to view the Accelerated Event Notification     *
   * client, specifically the Historical Data Viewer window, in   *
   * locales with national characters, e.g. Simplified Chinese.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * National characters did not resolve correctly.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * If the accelerated event contains some national language     *
   * characters, those characters might not be rendered correctly *
   * in the historical view window. For example, those characters *
   * are displayed as square boxes. This can be resolved by       *
   * adjusting the font used by the historical view window in AEN *
   * property file.                                               *
   *                                                              *
   * The steps to set the font are:                               *
   * a) Open the AEN property file                                *
   * The property file is in the following locations:             *
   *     * UNIX:                                                  *
   * userhome/.netcool/nco_aen_settings/aen.properties            *
   *     * Windows:                                               *
   * userhome\.netcool\nco_aen_settings\aen.properties            *
   *                                                              *
   * b) Add a line to the end of the file in this format:         *
   * system.List.font=font name, font style, font size            *
   *                                                              *
   * For example, to display Simplified Chinese characters        *
   * correctly you can add a line like as:                        *
   * system.List.font=courier,BOLD,11                             *
   *                                                              *
   * c) Save the change made in b), close the file.               *
   *                                                              *
   * d) Restart AEN to allow the property change to take effect.  *

   above if the national characters do not resolve.
