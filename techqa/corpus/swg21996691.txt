Title: IBM Send full AVP data with LEEF syslog event forwarding on Security Network IPS sensors - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to send more than the default data when using LEEF syslog forwarding on the Security Network IPS (GX) sensor? 

CAUSE
By default, LEEF syslog forwarding does not include all event details when forwarding individual events, but rather only sends along those fields that are common to all event types.

ANSWER
You can add the following parameter to the Tuning Parameters [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB2MG_4.6.2/com.ibm.ips.doc/tasks/configuring_global_tuning_parameters.htm] policy on the GX to include all details in forwarded events to the target system, including AVP data that might be unique to specific event types. 

Name: crm.leef.fullavp
Type: Boolean
Value: True

Notes: 

 * This parameter only works on GX appliances running firmware 4.6.2. 
 * When using this parameter, you must also use TCP for LEEF log forwarding since UDP truncates messages, which would cause some of the AVP data to be lost.

For additional information, see the Configuring LEEF log forwarding (syslog) [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSB2MG_4.6.2/com.ibm.ips.doc/tasks/configuring_leef.htm] documentation in the IBM Knowledge Center.
