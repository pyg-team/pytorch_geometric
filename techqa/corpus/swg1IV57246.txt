APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This condition has only affected a small number of machines in a
   specific customer environment.
   
   Our environ is running ITM 6.2.2, FP5. We are attempting to
   install the
   ITM OS agent (6.2.2, FP2) and are having problems with the
   install
   hanging on a pair of W2008, R2 servers. The problems seem
   similar on
   these machines, and the installer seems to stall after
   displaying an
   "Initializing Environment" message, where it hangs for hours.
   The sw
   was removed (add/remove programs), and server rebooted and then
   install
   reattempted several times. I am attaching the  "IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring
   <timestamp>.log" file for one of these servers.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An internal defect for 6.3.0 FP3 was created to fix the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On some Windows machines the install hangs while the popup
   Initializing Environment is shown. The current Read/Write pipe
   logic hangs while reading the output of the created process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The STDIN and STDOUT read/write pipe logic was changed to use a
   new method.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
