APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upon Installing, un-installing upgrading Python or IBM SPSS
   Statistics, the installation loses track of the location of the
   SPSS Extension commands (e.g. FUZZY) and throws a traceback
   error about not being able to find the module.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Edit the
   "/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/20/SPSSStatistics.app/Content
   s/MacOS/statsenv.sh" and add a reference to the location of the
   SPSS Extension commands.  For instance:
   
   # Where are the Extension Commands.
      export SPSS_EXTENSIONS_PATH='/Library/Application
   Support/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/20/extensions/'
