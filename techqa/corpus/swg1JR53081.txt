   (BPM) and IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition and is used in IBM
   Process Portal, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)

   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specially
   crafted URL to, when the URL is clicked, run a script in the
   user's web browser within the security context of the hosting
   website. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the
   user's cookie-based authentication credentials.
