Title: IBM Self monitoring alerts are not displayed in Display layer in 3 tier structure - United States

3 tier Omnibus 8.1 self monitoring sm_block_events_from_gateway Netcool Health dashboard TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Self monitoring alerts e.g probe watch, ITNM status alarms could not be displayed in Display layer ObjectServer in 3 tier structure 

CAUSE
This is as designed in Netcool/Omnibus 8.1 where a new trigger called sm_block_events_from_gateway introduced.
This trigger prevents the self monitoring events from being inserted into the Display layer ObjectServers from the layers below. This is to prevent duplication of events within the GUI.

Netcool/Webgui 8.1 has a new function of Health panel in the Netcool Health dashboard contains gauges that indicate the health status of ObjectServer components. Please check details below:

Self monitoring events can be viewed in Health panel in the Netcool Health dashboard in WebGUI.
Or operator's console fully rely on EventList, sm_block_events_from_gateway trigger can be disabled in aggregation layer.
