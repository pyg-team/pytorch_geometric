QUESTION
 Is using Vendavo software with ITCAM for AD supported? 

ANSWER
Vendavo is an application pricing software that can be used with WebSphere. When Vendavo is used with WAS, it will overwrite the WAS server.xml file. So if you've already got an ITCAM-instrumented WAS server.xml file (i.e., the server.xml file already has ITCAM arguments in it), then the Vendavo software will overwrite it. Thus using Vendavo with ITCAM and WAS is not supported. 

However, there is a workaround with using Vendavo and ITCAM on the same WAS server. Try putting the ITCAM arguments from the server.xml file into the Vendavo's $VENDAVO_HOME/config/users/config.properties file and see if it copies it back when the server is started. This has been known to work but the standard disclaimer applies here - this workaround is only provided on an use-at-your-own-risk situation.
