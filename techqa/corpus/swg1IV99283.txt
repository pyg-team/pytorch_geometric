APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A DASH widget which receives a JSON string containing an
   escaped quotation mark and is instructed to forward the string
   to an Impact policy will automatically send the string with the
   escape character.  Impact is handling this incorrectly by
   stripping out the escape character.  The Impact policy is then
   unable to successfully parse the JSON string and returns no
   data to DASH.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Only pre-existing workarounds are not very satisfactory: avoid
   the use of quotes inside strings in OMNIbus events (this limits
   OMNIbus functionality, which otherwise supports this), or, have
   Impact obtain the object server data directly from OMNIbus
   rather than via DASH (which removes the capability of wiring an
   Event Viewer directly to a DASH widget)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All Impact Users                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When passing a string value from a Dashboard widget to an    *
   * Impact policy dataset, the escape character for quotation    *
   * marks may be discarded by the policy.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When embedding a quotation mark inside of another quoted string,
   the quotation mark must normally be escaped e.g. "One \"Two\"
   Three". However, the escape character is lost by the policy when
   it parses the incoming string parameters. This issue can
   normally be worked around by double escaping the quotation mark.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In cases where double escaping is unsuitable, you can configure
   the policy parser to automatically escape and preserve embedded
   quotation marks. This can be done by setting the new property,
   impact.policy.escapestrings=true in the
   <servername>_server.props file.
