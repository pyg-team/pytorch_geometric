QUESTION
 What commands can I use to verify the software versions installed on my IBM Smart Analytics System for AIX? 

ANSWER
This document provides the AIX commands to verify the software versions. Refer to the related links on this page to access commands for Linux. 
If your IBM Smart Analytics System is installed with the IBM Smart Analytics System Control Console software, you can issue the "miinfo -d" command to see a detailed list of the software versions installed on the management node, all core warehouse nodes (administration, data, and standby nodes), and warehouse application nodes in your IBM Smart Analytics System environment.

If your IBM Smart Analytics System does not have the IBM Smart Analytics System Control Console software installed, you can use the following commands to see the software versions installed in your IBM Smart Analytics System environment.
