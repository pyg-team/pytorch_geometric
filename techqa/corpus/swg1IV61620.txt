APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a verification point failure occurs in an RRT (Robotic
   Response Time) script, the Verification Point Failures workspace
    provides information about the failure. The Event Type column
   in this workspace describes the type of event that occurred.
   These event types are enumerated in the following technote and
   in the ITCAM for Transactions User's Guide.
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21614794 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21614794]
   
   Event Type values:
   
   Authentication Failure
   Component Failure
   Content Failure
   Content Size,
   Custom Failure
   Expected Data Failure
   Expected Image Failure
   Expected Property
   Expected Text Failure
   Failure
   Generic Failure
   HTTP Return Code
   Page
   Return Code
   Timeout
   Title Failure
   URL Unavailable Failure
   Verification Point Failure
   
   Note that the "Event Type" is an attribute of the following
   attribute groups:
   
   _ RRT Robotic Playback Events
   _ RRT Robotic Playback Events Sampled
   
   Customer needs a description of each of these Event Type values,
   not just the existing enumeration. For example, the description
   of the Current Run Status on page 394 in the V7.3.0.1 User's
   Guide would be a good template.
