APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The RExtractAll function not returning array properly or
   functioning like it's described our current documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Provided the customer with a workaround policy, which
   essentially does what the customer is expecting the RExtractALL
   function to do, as described but our current documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  REXTRACT DOCUMENTATION
   
   The Netcool/Impact 3.1 Policy Reference Guide did not contain a
   working
   example for the RExtract function.  A description of this
   function and a
   working example are below:
   
   The RExtract function uses regular expressions to extract a
   substring from a
   string. This function supports Perl 5 regular expressions.
   
   The RExtract function has the following syntax:
   
   String = RExtract(Expression, Pattern)
   
   where Expression is a string that contains the substring to
   extract and
   Pattern is a regular expression pattern that specifies the
   substring to extract.
   
   Example
   
   The following example shows how to use the RExtract function.
   
   Log(RExtract("Not responding to ping on host DB_01",
   "\s(DB_01).*"));
   
   This example prints the following to the policy log:
   
   Parser Log: DB_01
   
   REXTRACTALL DOCUMENTATION
   
   The Netcool/Impact 3.1 Policy Reference Guide contains an
   incorrect description
   for the RExtractAll function.  The correct description is below:
   
   The RExtractAll function uses regular expression matching to
   extract multiple
   substrings from a string. The resulting matches are returned as
   elements in an
   array. This function supports Perl 5 regular expressions.
   
   To extract multiple substrings from a string, you call
   RExtractAll and pass a
   string expression and a regular expressions pattern. The pattern
   specifies the
   matching characters inside the expression and specifies which
   characters in the
   matching substring to extract. You identify the characters you
   want to extract
   by enclosing them in parentheses inside the pattern.
   
   When Netcool/Impact encounters a call to RExtractAll, it
   evaluates the
   expression using the specified pattern and locates the first
   matching substring.
   Then, it evaluates the substring and extracts the characters
   specified within
   the parantheses in the pattern. The function assigns the
   extracted character
   strings as elements in an array and passes the array back to the
   policy.
   function only extracts substrings from the first match found in
   the expression.
   
   The RExtractAll function has the following syntax:
   
   Array = RExtractAll(Expression, Pattern)
   
   where Expression is a string that contains the substring to
   extract and
   Pattern is a regular expression pattern that specifies the
   substrings to extract.
   You specify the string to extract from the match using
   parentheses characters.
   
   The following example shows how to use the RExtractAll function.
   
   Expression = "Node is DB_02 on rack RK_419";
   Pattern = "\s.*(DB_02).*(RK_419).*";
   Log(RExtractAll(Expression, Pattern));
   
   This example prints the following to the policy log:
   
   Parser log: {DB_02, RK_419}
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Fixed in Impact 3.1 Fix pack 5 readme and future documentation
