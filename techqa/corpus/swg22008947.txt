Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for OpenVMS (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL is used by IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for OpenVMS. IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for OpenVMS has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for OpenVMS 3.6.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The recommended solution is to apply the fix as soon as practical. Please see below for information about the available fixes. 

VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix 3.6.0 IT22551 Apply Fix Pack 3.6.0.5, available on Fix Central [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7EOther%20software&product=ibm/Other+software/Sterling+Connect%3ADirect+for+OpenVMS&release=All&platform=All&function=all] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
In versions of IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for OpenVMS older than 3.6.0.5, deselect the Triple-DES (3DES) cipher suite if it is specified in the Secure+ configuration. To avoid production outages when switching to another cipher, coordinate the configuration change to an agreed cipher with the security administrator of each remote node with which you use Secure+. The recommended cipher suite is AES128-SHA or AES256-SHA.
