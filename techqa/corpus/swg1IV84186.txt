ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TADDM 7.3.0.1 with eFix IV76046 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV76046]
   Moswos Agent *kzAgent) 7.3.0.2
   ITM 6.3 FP03
   
   The TADDM MOSWOS agent's (kzAgent) has a pre-req to tools like
   GSKIT for example, which are usually supplied via the ITM
   product. Later versions  of the ITM product ship with a
   different GSKIT version as required by  the MOSWOS agent. The
   agent therefore can no longer utilize the needed  tool for it's
   dependencies.
   
   Currently the MOSWOS agent 7.3.0.2 only supports and requires
   version  code 08.00.14.027 for GSKIT
   When attempting to deploy the kzAgent version 7.3.0.2 (shipped
   with  TADDM 7.3.x), the agent will  therefore err out
   complaining about such  needed dependency missing,
   
   Exact error experienced during failure:
   com.ibm.tivoli.itm.install.depot.BundleInstallException: Unable
   to find  bundle prerequisite: gs 08.00.14.027 lx8266
   
   Code Change Requirement Requested:
   Supply the required version of the GSKIT with the TADDM product
   along side the MOSWOS agent, or add support for newer versions
   of  the'gs' and/or 'ui' tool.  If possible, due to the agents
   purpose and integration with ITM, it is preferred that the agent
   supports and new agent version released, keep up with the
   support of the latest tool versions furnished by the ITM
   product.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A work around would be to install and add the agents required
   older version of the GSKIT tool, into the environment alongside
    existing newer version that shipped version via the ITM 3.6.x
   product for   example.
