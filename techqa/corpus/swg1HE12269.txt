APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description:
   When Domino email with a MIME body part which is written in a
   non-ASCII code page is parsed, code page information contained
   in the MIME part is not processed correctly. As a consequence,
   all characters in those body parts are treated as ASCII
   characters and all special characters which are not defined in
   the ASCII code page are replaced by the replacement character.
   
   When this email is previewed by using the IBM Content Collector
   web application or in the Document Viewer, the special
   characters are displayed using the replacement character. These
   MIME body parts are also not indexed correctly by IBM Content
   Collector P8 Content Search Services Support.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When  Domino email with a MIME body part which is written in a
   non-ASCII code page is parsed, code page information contained
   in the MIME part is not processed correctly. As a consequence,
   all characters in those body parts are treated as ASCII
   characters and all special characters which are not defined in
   the ASCII code page are replaced by the replacement character.
   
   When this email is previewed by using the IBM Content Collector
   web application or in the Document Viewer, the special
   characters are displayed using the  replacement character.
   
   Additionally, because these MIME body parts are not parsed
   correctly, the content is not indexed correctly by IBM Content
   Collector P8 Content Search Services Support.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0.6 IF002, encoded
   content in the MIME body part of Domino email will be parsed
   correctly.
