QUESTION
 How do you control the length of auto generated code? 

ANSWER


 

I have operations and function which have extremely long signatures. Rhapsody generates the entire function declaration on a single line which make it difficult to read. How can I fix this? The LineWrapLength property (under CG::Configuration) specifies the length of the code line generated during code generation. For example, if this property has the value 250, the generated code lines are wrapped to 250 characters. A value of 0 means that lines of code are not wrapped. Note that code for the following elements is not wrapped, regardless of this property setting: â€¢ User code parts (statechart actions and operation bodies) â€¢ Element annotations â€¢ Makefiles 1460 AnswerProduct versionPartner ContentInternal ContentCategoryReference IDAuthor
