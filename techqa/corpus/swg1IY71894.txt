ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Ascertained that when:
   1) ASW's IWAGENT Monitoring is turned on, and
   2) a server which has sent a related 'I am alive' message to the
   ASW
   database is later taken out of service--or even deselected for
   general
   monitoring by the ASW Hub
   
   the server will keep reappearing under that Hub.
   
   Cause:
   The ASW Hub's backend evidently expects an 'I am alive' message
   from all
   servers from which it has EVER received such a message--these
   messages
   are not periodically deleted, merely overwritten by the next 'I
   am
   alive' message from that server.
   
   Similarly, if someone manually entered a server to be monitored
   by a Hub
   for which IWAGENT Monitoring was enabled--even if that server
   never
   existed--ASW will post a 'didn't receive I am alive' message
   under
   "Last Agent Evaluation" and that server will keep appearing
   under the
   relevant ASW Hub at the Pinnacle Console until such time as BOTH
   the
   IWAlerts for that server and the Last Agent Evaluation message
   are
   deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Open the IWASW.NSF on the ASW Hub in question, and go to the
   "Last Agent Evaluation" View and delete the document for the
   relevant server. Also, delete any IWALERTS for that server.
   
   Once the Hub's cache of information is refreshed--after the
   above deletions--the affected servers will no longer appear
   under that Advanced ServerWatch Hub.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unforeseen annoyance, in that someone may remove a server from
   the list to be monitored by Advanced ServerWatch, but still see
   it in the list when there are "I am alive" messages for it in
   the database.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  LOCAL FIX:
   Open the IWASW.NSF on the ASW Hub in question, and go to the
   "Last Agent Evaluation" View and delete the document for the
   relevant server. Also, delete any IWALERTS for that server.
   
   Once the Hub's cache of information is refreshed--after the
   above deletions--the affected servers will no longer appear
   under that Advanced ServerWatch Hub.
