QUESTION
 Applying sufficient escaping for the number of parser layers to place quotes in the SQL generated by a Policy 

CAUSE
The old "how to parse quotes" problem.

ANSWER
This is similar to the issue covered in the TechNote: "GetByFilter() function parse error with single quote in string" [link below], but more generic. 

The GetByFilter() function (among other Policy actions such as CommandResponse and DirectSQL) produces SQL with definable values and quoting within strings in the final SQL statement might be required.

The other TechNote #1636553 [link below] is more verbose on the subject, but essentially you need to escape a quote five times - for example:


 * 


or: 
 *
