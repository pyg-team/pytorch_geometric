Title: IBM ECM System Monitor Agent fails to start if the client host server did not perform a clean shut down. - United States

fsm; ecmsm TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the server hosting “IBM FSM CALA Monitoring Agent” service goes down for un-expected reboot while FSM Client services are in ‘automatic’ start. If we try to start FSM services it remains in a ''starting'' mode only.


CAUSE

Files identified in below section 'Resolving the problem' are causing the service not to start. 
These files are created by the Monitoring agent during startup and contain information about the currently running client agent service. 
Under normal circumstances the contents of these files are removed when the service stops cleanly. 
If the client host server crashes or is unexpectedly re-booted, and the service does not get shut down cleanly, these files may be left behind, and will contain process information that is no longer valid. 
If the service finds these files with content during startup the service will not start. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop the CALA agent services on the client servers where this issue is happening.
Ensure that the monitoring agent service is stopped by checking the Windows Task manager and look for cala_srv.exe (it should not be listed).
If the cala_srv.exe process is listed you will need to either try and stop it with the command line utility 'net stop cala_srv' .
Or kill the process in Windows task manager. 
Rename/backup, copy and remove the .at files in the <<FSM AGENT ROOT>>\cala directory 
logctlsrv.at 
logctlcmd.at 

These files must be removed.
