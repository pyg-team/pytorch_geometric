PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to start ITCAM YN agent 



Starting Monitoring Agent for WebSphere ... 

KCIIN0206E Could not start/stop agent : java.lang. 

StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Tar file containing the ConfigInfo, RunInfo and RunInfo_Description 
file with the following commands: 
cd /itm_home/config/.ConfigData 
tar cf /tmp/config.info.tar *Info* 

Perform the agent start function with additional tracing with the 
following commands: 
TRACE_LEVEL=DEBUG_MAX 
export TRACE_LEVEL 
cd /itm_home/bin/./itmcmd agent start yn 

tar cf /tmp/logs.tar logs/itm_* logs/candle_* 

Send the two tar files to the PMR: 
/tmp/config.tar 
/tmp/logs.tar 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It appears that there is an invalid 
record in the RunInfo_Description file. 

This is how it was tested: 
I install the OS agent from 6.20 FP1 IF2 media 
I then added the same extra record ("nt") to my RunInfo_Description file 
and itmcmd agent start displayed the same exception. 

./itmcmd agent start lz 
Starting Monitoring Agent for Linux OS ... 
KCIIN0206E Could not start/stop agent : 
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException 

I removed the extra record and I was able to start the agent.
