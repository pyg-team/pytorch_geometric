Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading HMC to V7R7.7.0 SP2, user is no longer able to connect to the HMC using Internet Explorer from Windows XP or Windows 2003 Server 

SYMPTOM
Remote browser connection to the HMC from Internet Explorer on Windows XP or Windows 2003 Server fails entirely.


CAUSE
The Certificate Authority used for HMC V7R7.7.0 SP2 is configured to use SHA-256 encryption. Windows XP prior to SP3 and Windows 2003 Server require a patch to support SHA-256.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Review the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP clients cannot obtain certificates from a Windows Server 2008-based certification authority (CA) if the CA is configured to use SHA2 256 or higher encryption [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968730], and apply the appropriate fix.
