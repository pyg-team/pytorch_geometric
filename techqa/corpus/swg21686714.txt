PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 EventId like SNMPTRAP-IETF-BGP4-MIB-bgpBackwardTransition from mttrapd probe does not get enriched from ncp_g_event 

SYMPTOM
no NmosObjInst, no NmosEntityId


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The eventGateway stitcher 

/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/eventGateway/stitchers/LookupNbrFailure.stch
changed with fp4.
If you were using fp3 with 3.9 and did not have a problem with enrichment for mttrapd events.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If NmosObjInst and NmosEntityId are not being enriched for this type of event, and they were with fp3, run a test to replace that stitcher. 

[root@linux stitchers]# pwd
/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/eventGateway/stitchers
[root@linux stitchers]# cd default/
[root@linux default]# ls -lart LookupNbrFailure*
-rw-rw-r--. 1 root root 2036 Feb 22 2013 LookupNbrFailure.stch.pre
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 2284 Nov 19 2013 LookupNbrFailure.stch
[root@linux default]#

the default directory will contain the fp3 stitcher, suffixed '.pre'.

stop ITNM, move LookupNbrFailure.stch.pre from the /default directory back to
/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/eventGateway/stitchers/LookupNbrFailure.stch
start ITNM and retest

fp5 will contain a fix also and once available this fixpack can be an option.
