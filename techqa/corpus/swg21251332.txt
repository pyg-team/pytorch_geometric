Title: IBM Add WebSphere 6.0 Runtime library to Libraries in Java Build Path - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a new J2EE project is created with IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v6 as runtime, the .classpath file has the following entry: 
classpathentry kind="con" path="com.ibm.wtp.server.java.core.container/com.ibm.ws.ast.st.
runtime.core.runtimeTarget.v60/was.base.v6"/. This corresponds to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries as an entry, "Websphere 6.0 Runtime."
If you select the entry and remove it, there is no way to add it back. You cannot add a library because WAS v6 is missing here. If a J2EE project has WebSphere Process Server (WPS) as runtime, and is exported from WebSphere Integration Developer (WID) and imported in a RAD-only environment, viewing Project > Properties throws errors. 

CAUSE
Adding WebSphere® 6.0 Runtime library to Libraries in Java™ Build Path is not an available feature in IBM® Rational® Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) version 6.x.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Server runtime entries should not be removed from the Libraries tab of the Java™ Build Path properties. In cases where they are removed or in instances where a project is imported from WID targeting a runtime not available in RAD, the following method can add an available runtime library back to the .classpath.


Server runtime entries are entered into the .classpath file by choosing a server target. For a J2EE application, go to the EAR level. Select Project > Properties > Server, choose a target runtime, and make sure the Include child project is selected. Click Apply. 

In cases where WAS v6 runtime is the only one available and was removed from the Libraries, a new target server for WebSphere 6.0 Runtime can be created by clicking the New button. 

This feature is available as of the version 7.0 of RAD.
