CAUSE

If the retention on the folder is set to Indefinite: 

 * Set an Expiration date for a few minutes in the future. 
 * Once the expiration date passes, the folder can be deleted.


If the Retention setting is set to an Expiration date in the future:  * The folder can only be deleted after the date has passed. 
 * The Expiration date cannot be set to an earlier date/time.


If the Retention setting is set to Permanent:  * You will not be able to delete the folder.
