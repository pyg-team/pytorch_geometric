PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the MS-DOS prompt used to start APM UI servers is closed or if the user logs out of the system, the APM UI servers stop running. 

SYMPTOM
The SCR, SCRDERBY and APMUI server processes end when the user logs out or the MS-DOS window is closed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit server.bat under the "<APMUI_HOME>/bin" directory, change 'java' on line 362 to 'javaw'. 

Original (line 362):
set JAVA_CMD_QUOTED="!JAVA_HOME!\bin\java"

Corrected (line 362):
set JAVA_CMD_QUOTED="!JAVA_HOME!\bin\javaw"

Restart the servers.
