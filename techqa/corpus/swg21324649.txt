Title: IBM Change the default open mode for one DOORS module - United States

Text:
KB9298; default open mode; exclusive edit; read only; shareable edit TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to change the default open mode for a specific module in IBM Rational DOORS
so that it is READ_ONLY rather than Exclusive Edit? 

CAUSE
The documentation about "Select an edit mode" indicates you can change the default open mode [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399402], but that applies to all modules in DOORS; not a select item.

ANSWER
No, it is not possible to change the DOORS configuration so only a select module opens in a different mode. 

Note: Administrators familiar with DOORS Extension Language may write a script to trigger on the pre-open event of a module to alter the behavior for a designated module.
