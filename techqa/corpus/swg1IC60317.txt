ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TPC Device Server will not start when the password
   encryption on AIX is set to use the Secured
   Hash Algorithm with a 256 bit key (SHA256).  The failure occurs
   when Websphere attempts to
   authenticate the user and password.  A javacore dump occurs
   within the libUnixRegistryImpl.so library for the native call
   ntv_basicAuthenticate.  Although the problem occurs within
   Websphere, the changes required to resolve this within Websphere
   need to be included in the installation of TPC
   .

   DB2 Version used for Server: n/a
   The defect is against component: 5608TC300
   Server/Manager build/release: 3.3.x.x
   Agent build/release (TPC-R): n/a
   Server/Manager (OS): AIX 5.1, 5.3, 6.1
   Agent (OS):  n/a
   
   
   This problem has also surfaced (with the same javacore for
   DeviceServer's WebSphere Application Server) when trying to log
   into the TPC 4.2.x web GUI, resulting in a generic "Status: 12"
   internal error pop up message and the javacore file.  Other
   users can still log into the web GUI successfully (after
   restarting the device server) if they have not had a loadable
   password algorithm (LPA) applied to them.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workaround is to change the password encryption on AIX from
   ssha256 to another encryption algoithm.  No loadable password
   algorithm should be used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The root cause of this problem is with the WebSphere Application
   Server product.  APAR PK83991 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK83991] is tracking it with the WebSphere
   team.  Fixes provided for that APAR can be applied to
   TotalStorage Productivity Center when available.  TotalStorage
   Productivity Center will pick up the fixes when available in a
   later release.
   
   This problem applies to Tivoli Storage Productivity
   Center 4.2.x and earlier releases. LPA should not be used with
   them.
   
   This problem does not occur with Tivoli Storage Productivity
   Center 5.1 and later.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Apply APAR PK83991 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK83991] fix when available.
   Turn off LPA (loadable password algorithm).
