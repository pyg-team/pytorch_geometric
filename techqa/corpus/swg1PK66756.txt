APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using a distributed DVIPA in the host field of on
   the screen Servers -> Application Servers -> servername ->
   Ports. If these are regular IP addresses, static VIPAs, or
   non-distributed DVIPAs, everything works as expected.
   However, if a distributed DVIPA is specified, then the node
   agent will not receive immediate feedback if the application
   server is down and the node agent is trying to start the
   application server.
   .
   Instead, the node agent will have to wait for the
   node agent's JVM TCP/IP timeout period before
   realizing that the target application server is down.
   ..
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update the ServerIndex.xml of "*" instead of our actual host
   name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  V6.1.0 for z/OS who use distributed         *
   *                  DVIPA.                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The V6.1 WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                      Information Center does not indicate    *
   *                      that if you specify a distributed       *
   *                      DVIPA, in the Host field for a port,    *
   *                      the node agent does not receive         *
   *                      immediate feedback if the application   *
   *                      server is down and the node agent is    *
   *                      trying to start the application server. *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  Update the Information Center with          *
   *                  additional information.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   The V6.1 WebSphere Application Server
   Information Center does not indicate that
   if you specify regular IP addresses,
   static VIPAs, or non-distributed DVIPAs,
   in the Host field for a port, everything
   works as expected. However, if you specify
   a distributed DVIPA, the node agent does
   not receive immediate feedback if the
   application server is down and the node
   agent is trying to start the application
   server. Instead, the node agent has to
   wait for the node agent's JVM TCP/IP
   timeout period to expire before realizing
   that the target application server is down.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR requires changes to documentation.
   
   NOTE: Periodically, we refresh the documentation on our Web
   site, so the changes might have been made before you   read
   this text. To access the latest on-line documentation, go to
   the product library page at:
   
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   
   A change to the WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1
   Information Center will be made available in September, 2008.
   
   The following note will be added to the description of the
   Host field that is contained in the topic "Ports settings:"
   
   Note: If your TCP/IP network is set up to use distributed
   dynamic virtual IP addresses (DVIPAs), and if the node agent
   is in the process of starting the application server, TCP/IP
   waits until the JVM TCP/IP timeout period expires before
   notifying the node agent that the target application server is
   not responsive.
