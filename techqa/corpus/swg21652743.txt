QUESTION
 How can I get the timestamps from when a job (executable-only) was imported into my IBM Information Server DataStage environment? 

ANSWER
One way to check the modification date would be to check timestamps for corresponding job files, as an executable job will only be modified when it is imported. 

When you edit/save/import or compile a DataStage job, the corresponding RT_CONFIGxx files for that job are updated on disk in the project directory. (RT_CONFIGxx "files" are type-30 universe files which are implemented on disk as a directory of same name containing a DATA.30 and OVER.30 file). Those DATA.30 and OVER.30 files are updated when a job is saved or compiled. 

So if you "cd" to a project directory and issue the following command: 
ls -l RT_CONFIG* 

then you will see output such as: 
RT_CONFIG14: 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dsadm dstage 4096 Jun 26 00:17 DATA.30 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dsadm dstage 4096 Jun 26 00:07 OVER.30 

RT_CONFIG16: 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dsadm dstage 4096 May 25 20:35 DATA.30 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dsadm dstage 2048 May 25 20:34 OVER.30 

Now if you want to see what job name that RT_CONFIG14 file corresponds to, you can use the following query in the uvsh shell to display the name of job 14 in that project. 


 1. cd to the DSEngine directory 
 2. issue command: . ./dsenv 
 3. issue command: bin/uvsh (you must issue command from DSEngine directory, not from bin directory) 
 4. issue command: LOGTO myProjectName (project name case sensitive) 
 5. issue command: LIST DS_JOBS WITH JOBNO=14 


There is not really an easier way to track job updates from disk files in DataStage...these files were not intended as a programmable interface. Their formats and contents are not documented. But if you just want to track when updates occur, it may be sufficient for your needs to just track file timestamps for the RT_CONFIGxx files. 

To get the job number for a given job name use the command: 
LIST DS_JOBS WITH @ID=jobname
