APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Changing state of a Test Suite Result to "Reject" shows  the
   action as  "Approve" instead.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a Test Suite and run it.
   2. Bring up the Test Suite Result from Execution-> Browse ->
   Test Suite Results
   3. Change the state  using  "Ready for Review" action button
   and save.
   4.  Change the state  again and choose  "Reject" action.  It
   immediately  shows up "Approve" as action.  In the drop-down, it
   adds an option "Return to Draft". If you click "Reject"  again,
   it shows up as 'Approve" and another instance of "Return to
   Draft" gets added to the drop-down.
