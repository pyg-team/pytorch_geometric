IBM Debug Tool Plug-in for Eclipse provides easy access through a graphical user interface (GUI) on the workstation to Debug Tool for z/OS. The GUI can be used to help debug z/OS-based load modules running on MVS, including load modules that run in a subsystem like CICS, DB2 or IMS. The GUI interface allows you to access debugging capability similar to that accessed by the z/OS host interface, allowing you to do the following tasks: 

 * Set and clear breakpoints at a specific line. 
 * Set and clear breakpoints for an error or warning-level error that is based on Language Environment severities. 
 * Run to a breakpoint. 
 * Step into a procedure. 
 * Step over a procedure. 
 * View variable values and change them as you step through the code. 
 * View variable values in the context of a larger area of storage. 
 * View the call stack. 


Here is a screenshot of the Debug Tool GUI plug-in in action:
