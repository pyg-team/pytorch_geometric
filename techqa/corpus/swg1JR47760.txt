APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPMConfig command, used to create profiles in BPM 8.5, takes in
   a .properties file that contains various property-value pairs
   that BPMConfig command accepts. One such property is
   "profilePath" that, if set, defines the location where a
   particular profile should be created. This property is
   essential if users wish to create profiles in non-standard
   locations. The documentation for BPM 8.5 does not properly
   document this property.
