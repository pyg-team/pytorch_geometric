Title: IBM SOA/KD4 Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) client jar file certificates expire 17th April 2016 - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 The ITCAM for SOA JARs provided for Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) support will expire 17th April 2016 and may cause errors when using the TEP Java Web Start or Browser clients. TEP Desktop clients will be unaffected. 

CONTENT
This is part of a wider IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) issue and your other installed products may also be affected. Please see the related URLs for the general ITM notice. 

ITCAM for SOA is providing two methods to resolve this issue. 

 

1. Update to ITCAM for SOA 7.2.0.1 IF0009 

This release of ITCAM for SOA is intended to permanently resolve the issue by time stamping and signing the JARs.

7.2.0.1-TIV-ITCAMSOA-IF0009 README and download links [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002627] 

 

2. Contact support to update your current JAR files 

If you cannot upgrade, contact IBM support by opening a PMR requesting the updated certificate for Tivoli Enterprise Portal server (TEPS) support files. You will need to send the jar and zip files from your Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS) located as follows:

UNIX/Linux
<InstallDirectory>/<Architecture>/cw/classes

Windows
%CANDLE_HOME%\CNB\classes 

Support will then update and return the jar files. 

Once the jar files are returned from IBM support, copy the files back to the same location on the tep server noted above in this document. After the jar files are copied back to the TEP server there is no further action needed on the tep server side. The TEP server does not need to be reconfigured nor does it need to be restarted. On the TEP client side the java plugin jar cache should be cleared in order to force the download of the newly signed jar files to the client machine. This can be accomplished by going to Windows control panel and opening the java plugin control panel. From the "General" tab in the plugin control panel press the "Settings" button under the "Temporary Internet Files" heading, then press the "Delete Files" button. Once the delete is complete, restart the TEP client to force the download of the newly signed jar files from the TEP server.
