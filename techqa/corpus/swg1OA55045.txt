ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1) Telnet is in session with a Session Manager LU
   2) The Session Manager LU has an active session with TSO
   3) VTAM begins to terminate the SessMgr->TSO session and both
      applications are notified.
   4) The LOSTERM Exit for TSO is driven with a CLEANUP RU
   5) TSO attempts to issue a CLSDST to terminate the session with
      the SessMgr LU, however VTAM has already notified the SessMgr
      and it has closed the LU
   6) TSO's CLSDST fails with RPLRTNCD/FBK2 x'1413' for an
      Invalid CID (session is already gone). Message issued due to
      CLSDST failure -
      IKT115I TSO UNABLE TO DISCONNECT TERMINAL luname
   7) TSO unconditionally issues an abend s/0AB RC=105 and takes a
      diagnostic dump.

   ****************************************************************
   This problem may be summarized as follows:
      1) TSO/VTAM lostterm routine IKTLTERM received
          control with the cleanup RU to cleanup the session.
          VTAM already terminated the session for this LU.
      2)  IKTLTERM issued CLSDST to terminate the session.
           It failed with the RPL return code and reason code
           of X'14' and X'13' to indicate the CID is invalid and
           the session is already gone.
      3)  IKTLTERM issued an ABEND0AB RC105 to
           terminate the address space and also
           requested dump for this ABEND0AB.
      4) IKTLTERM should not take the dump for
          the ABEND0AB RC105 for the invalid
          CID condition. It is not necessary for
          the session which was already
          terminated by VTAM.
