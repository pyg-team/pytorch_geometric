APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When db2 is missing a SMS temporary page during sort/reorg, it
   reports misleading error message in the db2idag.log as well as
   to the prompt. Currently, it reports SQL0968C to the prompt and
   DIA8312C in db2diag stating that the disk is full. The correct
   message should give an indication of temp object corruption or
   the fact that the SMS temporary page is missing.
   .
   Here is the db2diag.log message we currently dump:
   .
   2006-06-17-19.09.05.870920   Instance:   Node:000
   PID:4960(db2agent (dbname) 0)   TID:1
   buffer pool services  sqlbrdpg Probe:19   Database:
   
   DIA8312C Disk was full.
   ZRC=0x850F000C
   .
   The APAR will fix this message to dump a correct message
   indicating that there is a temp object corruption of a sms temp
   page is missing.
