PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Tivoli product installation on a Linux platform fails during the installation of Tivoli Integrated Portal. The TIP install, Deployment Engine, and Machineplan_localhost logs contain no errors. They just end abruptly. 

SYMPTOM
No errors or exceptions in the de_trace, TIP install, or machineplan_localhost logs. They just end abruptly.


CAUSE
There is not enough memory available for the TIP installer to run. The TIP installation process is killed by the Linux kernel. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Run the "free" command at the Linux command prompt. Ensure there is at least 2GB of available memory.


Check the /var/logs/messages file from the time of the TIP install failure for a message similar to: 

####### 

Apr 30 16:44:05 dgphxrpttl001 kernel: Out of memory: Kill process 27916 

(java) score 277 or sacrifice child 

#######


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add memory to the server. There must be at least 2GB of virtual memory free for the installer.
