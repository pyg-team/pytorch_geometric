PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational AppScan Source Edition for Security fails to load successfully in a Linux environment. 

SYMPTOM
Attempts to start AppScan Source for Security on Linux by issuing the command ./appscansrc results in no login dialog appearing and control returns to the console. 

No errors are written to the logs in {AppScan Source install directory}\logs directory.



CAUSE
This can be caused by certain ulimit settings being set to high. Specifically, if max locked memory (-l) and stack size (-s) are set too high, for example to 3,000,000 and 512000 respectively, that can cause AppScan Source for Security to fail to start. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Dropping the ulimit down to a more modest level of 32 and 10240 may allow AppScan Source for Security to start properly.

For example:

To view current ulimit settings:
ulimit -a

To set values as described above:
ulimit -l 32
ulimit -s 10240

Note: Default values for these and other user limits may be set in /etc/security/limits.conf, /etc/profile or /etc/initscript depending on the OS implementation.
