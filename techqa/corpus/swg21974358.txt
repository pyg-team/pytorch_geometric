PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Tivoli Integrated Portal, while investigating login failures "Login failed. Check the user ID and password and try again" there are no related messages in either the SystemOut log, or the trace logs with security traces enabled. 

CAUSE
At the time this technical note is being written, the reason there are no related messages in the SystemOut or trace logs is not yet known. This technical note will be updated when the cause is known.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Recreate the login issue and monitor the SystemOut and/or trace logs for related messages. The logs will likely indicate that ffdc log segments are created, but no other useful messaging is present.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If there are no relevant or helpful messages in the SystemOut or trace logs, check the ffdc log segments that are created near the time of the login failure. The ffdc logs will likely have messaging that is useful to troubleshoot login failures.
