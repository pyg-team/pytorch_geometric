Text:
migration; SRVE0190E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
During the upgrade-profile task it fails with the following...

SRVE0190E: File not found:

SYMPTOM
The ConfigTrace.log shows the following...

at
com.ibm.icm.jcr.task.AbstractRemoteTask.execute(AbstractRemoteTask.java:
840)

This indicates a problem during Portal startup. Review of the SystemOut.log shows the following...

[6/5/14 15:45:52:141 CDT] 000000b3 filter E
com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.filter.FilterInstanceWrapper doFilter
SRVE8109W: Uncaught exception thrown by filter Extensible Filter:
java.io.FileNotFoundException: SRVE0190E: File not found:
/jcr/remotetask
at
com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.extension.DefaultExtensionProcessor._processEDR(
DefaultExtensionProcessor.java:949)


CAUSE
This indicates that the WCM application is not starting correctly during Portal startup.

Further review of the SystemOut.log shows that the JCR application is not initializing because the startup does not contain the following line...

Starting application: JavaContentRepository

This can occur when the WASPostUpgrade task fails to migrate the
JavaContentRepository.ear. If so, this would be seen in the WASPostUpgrade logs....

MIGR0340W: Application JavaContentRepository.ear did not deploy.


ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8.0x
Linux

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
See sections above...

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this case, the customer simply manually moved the missing application from the migration bundle and placed them into the <portal_profile_root>/config/cells/<cellname>/applications directory and re-ran the WASPostUpgrade task
