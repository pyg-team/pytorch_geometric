ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The integrated version of EditLive has been updated to 7.6.2.84

   - EditLive applet is blocked from executing with Java 7 update
   45+
   - security warning dialog with Java 7 update 51
   - EditLive fails to load via SSL (https)
   - missing Permissions attribute warning is displayed within the
   initial applet application dialog when using a locale other than
   English
