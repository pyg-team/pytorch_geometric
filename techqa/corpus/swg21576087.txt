webgui default certificate not trusted untrusted TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When using your browser and accessing the IBM WebSphere DataPower WebGui, the browser will present a message noting the DataPower's certificate was not issued by a trusted certificate authority. 

ANSWER

When using your browser and accessing the DataPower WebGui, the browser will present a message noting the DataPower's certificate was not issued by a trusted certificate authority. This is because DataPower provides a generic SSL certificate which cannot reflect the IP address and/or hostname of the you company's appliance. Best practice is to ALWAYS create your own SSL certificate for the WebGUI, (or any place else that DataPower provides a pre-defined certificate). 

You can generate a self-signed one if you don't have any CA facilities, or can generate a signed one through your CA for your company's use. Use the "Generate Certificate" action button in the WebGUI. Click on System Control's icon and scroll down to "Generate Device Certificate".
