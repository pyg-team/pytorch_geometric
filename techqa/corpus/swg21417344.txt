Title: IBM Cannot attach file to Notes mail message when using Windows folder shortcut - United States

Text:
folder; file; attachment; OS; Windows; mail; message; shortcut TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
A file attachment cannot be added to a mail message, instead the folder shortcut is added to the message.

SYMPTOM
A folder shortcut is added to a Notes mail message instead of a file stored in the folder.

CAUSE
The Additional Options setting 

ENVIRONMENT
Notes 8.5.1, Windows XP SP3

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This option is only for Windows operating systems. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Notes Client Preferences includes an Additional Options "Treat shortcuts as files when selecting in file dialogs." This setting applies to creating and saving attachments. Following is an excerpt from the Notes Help database:




Shortcut (.lnk) files you select in the Create Attachment dialog box will attach as the full files they reference rather than as shortcuts (links). Shortcuts chosen as the destination location when saving attachments will be treated like full files, in which case the shortcuts are overwritten by the file being saved (rather than the file being saved overwriting the file location that the shortcut points to). 

Note: This setting applies only to Notes clients running on Windows operating systems.

With this preference enabled, when an enduser navigates to an OS folder shortcut, the shortcut will be added to the mail message rather than opening to display folder contents as expected. In order to access the shortcut folder contents, the user should disable the preference "Treat shortcuts as files when selecting in file dialogs."
