   CI-4156 - Creating an interview is writing two entries into the
   Activity table.
   Previously, when an interview was created it would appear twice
   in the My Appointments POD, duplicate activates were written,
   this has now been addressed and when an interview is created
   there is only one activity relating to that interview displayed
   in the My Appointments POD.
