APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently, PACOptimizer can be configured to run for a certain
   amount of time. However, if it is executed the next time, it
   starts its work at the beginning. This APAR introduces
   an option to make PACOptimizer resume where it finished last
   time. When PACOptimizer has finished with a timeout, it prints
   out the ObjectID of the resource where optimization stopped.
   To enable this feature, in the WAS Admin Console add the
   following configuration property to the Resource Environment
   Provider "WP AccessControlService":
   
   accessControlConfig.optimizationResumeResources"
   
   The value is a comma-separated list of ObjectIDs. These
   ObjectIDs will be used as resume points - in other words:
   all resources that have been handled in previous run will be
   skipped.
