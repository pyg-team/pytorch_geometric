APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1.  Launch catia
   2.  Select large PRC
   3.  Open Filter GUI
   4.  right click attributes, add criterion on attribute
   5.  Customer adds 5 customized attributes, 3 where attribute
   = value, 2 where attribute = *value*.   Support was able to
   repro the problem with 5 standard attributes (3 = value, 2 =
   *value*) and also a separate test with 3 attributes where
   attribute = value, no wildcard.
   6.  change the filter to "OR" filter and hit OK
   7.  the query will never finish (as far as we know).
   Customer has 6 minute limit on queries.   Support tested in
   the lab and killed the 5-attribute test after 12 minutes and
   the 3 attribute test after 22 minutes.   Customer reports
   that it drives database server excessive CPU and that if 2 of
   them are running simulataneously it freezes the db.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN I-PLM Collaborative
   Innovation
   Additional Closure Information:
   R&D has examined the scenario and the attachments.
   1.  They believe that the query described in the scenario is
   too complex (with 5 attributes, 2 of them with begin+end
   wildcards)
   2.  The proposed SQL solution is not workable and will not
   produce the correct results
   3.  They do not have any plan to modify the code for large
   "OR" queries in the Filter
