Title: IBM Warning # 209 when running a large syntax file. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running a very long syntax file with multiple GET DATA and SAVE OUTFILE commands. I can execute portions of the syntax independently but when I run the entire syntax I get warnings as shown below. How can I run this syntax as one with out errors?

>Warning # 209
>A truncation error occurred while writing to the command journal file.
>Please check the contents of this file before using it as input to SPSS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The syntax is exceeding the length of the journal file (60 KB). Please go to Edit -> Options -> File Locations tab. 
In the Session Journal section there is an option for Record Syntax in Journal. 
If journaling is on please chose the option to Overwrite rather than append. 
Another option would be to turn journaling off by deselecting Record Syntax in Journal
