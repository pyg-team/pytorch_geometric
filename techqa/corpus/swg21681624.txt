QUESTION
 What values to use in the System Log and SSL Proxy Profile parameters in the Datapower agent configuraiton? 

ANSWER
In this link, the documentation provides information about configuring the Datapower monitoring agent.
www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/?lang=en#!/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/datapower/fac_config_agent_specific_win.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/?lang=en#!/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/datapower/fac_config_agent_specific_win.html]

There are two fields/parameters to configure:
System Log
SSL Proxy Profile value

The documentation is not very clear on the values to input in these fields/parameters during the agent configuration.

For the System Log parameter, you have to first configure the Syslog daemon, either on Unix/Linux or Windows and then put in the syslog name in here. Most Unix installations will come with a syslog daemon. For Windows you have to download one off the web and install/configure it. For Syslog, you need do some configure on the DataPower side to make sure the DataPower appliance can send syslog events/info to the agent side. And you also need to configure syslog service on the agent side to receive the syslog from DataPower appliance.

The following is a snapshot of Datapower configuration.

In most cases, the SSL Proxy Profile parameter, the default certificate for xml interface is used. If the default certificate is used, then the blank is ok for the "SSL Proxy Profile".

Here is an example, if the "Custom SSL Proxy Profile" is none, then the default certificate is used.
