ANSWER
Kindly follow the steps noted below to change the browser language settings: 

1. In Firefox, click on the (orange) Firefox menu button at the top left corner > Options > Option: 


Firefox menu options [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=1]

2. A new window appears - it's called Options. Look for Content tab, Under Languages, click on the Choose button

Options window [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=2]

3. In the Languages windows, use the dropdown menu to select your preferred language and click Add once complete. In this example, we're going to add Russian (ru) to demonstrate the translation.

Languages window [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21680365&aid=3]

4. The language that is displayed when you access the portal is always the first language in your browser's language settings. Therefore, make sure Chinese/China (zh-cn) language is the first language. Otherwise, use Move Up your preferred language as default.

5. Once finished, click OK all the way to exit Languages and Options window. Open or refresh any DASH portal/page (in Firefox) and it will be displayed in your preferred language. Here, we are using Chinese/China (zh-cn) as our example - see below.

Take note, changing Language settings in Firefox does not alter your language settings in your operating system (OS).
