Title: IBM InfoSphere Data Replication shows the following error message when saving the subscription: Derived expression column IDs for table <source_table> in subscription <subscription_name> do not form proper sequence - United States

Text:
IIDR; CDC; wrong sequence; proper sequence TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you are saving your subscription from the Management Console you are getting the following error message: 

Derived expression column IDs for table <source_table> in subscription <subscription_name> do not form proper sequence 

CAUSE
You are not able to save the table mapping changes

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
From the configuration tab -> right click on the table mapping -> Table Properties -> Source Properties

Check the column ID and verify if there is any ID duplicates or wrong ID sequence.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This could be caused if the subscription was imported from an old version or the derived expression was added after importing the subscription with old xml version and the derived expressions are not following the correct ID sequence.




To resolve this issue, you can export/import the subscription again or delete the table mapping and map the table again. 

This will create new sequence and you should be able to edit/save your subscription.
