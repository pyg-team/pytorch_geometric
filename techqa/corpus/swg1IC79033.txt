APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ Explorer v7.0.1 allows changes to the queue
   manager properties which affect registry settings.  For
   example, these include:
   
   o enabling exits
   o changing channels settings
   o transaction log files
   
   Some of these changes require a queue manager restart to be
   picked up.
   
   After setting up the queue manager to use a local API exit with
   an invalid module name, for example 'xxxx', the queue manager
   is stopped.  On restart, there is an error for the exit, and
   the queue manager fails to start.
   
   The error reported is:
   
   AMQ7214: The module for API Exit 'xxxx' could not be loaded.
   exitvalue = 71
   
   When an attempt is made to resolve this misconfiguration by
   re-editing the appropriate fields while the queue manager is
   stopped, WMQ Explorer reports:
   
   AMQ4043
   Queue manager not available for connection - reason 2059
   
   This procedure works when using WebSphere MQ v6, and is also
   successful if using 'amqmdain' commands rather than using
   WebSphere MQ Explorer v7.0.1 to make the configuration changes.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use amqmdain commands to fix the settings in the registry
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere MQ Explorer V7.0.1, who
   try to alter the queue manager properties for a system local
   queue manager, while the queue manager is in the stopped state.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When using the WebSphere MQ Explorer V7.0.1, when a user makes
   change to the queue manager properties page, a check is made to
   see if the queue manager is running.
   
   If the queue manager was stopped, the WebSphere MQ Explorer
   notified the user that the property change cannot be applied.
   However, this operation should be permitted for a system local
   queue manager, regardless of the running state of the queue
   manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ Explorer V7.0.1 code has been changed to allow
   an update to the queue manager properties for a system local
   queue manager, regardless of its running state.
