COMMENTS
 *  The reason the agent does not report this is that it is not
   the agent that sets it; this value is by the Windows shell.
   The agent does nothing more here than launch the shell that
   it is configured to launch.
   
   If you want it to use a different shell, then that change
   can be made, as documented, by altering the "shell" option
   in bfagent.conf to point at the one that is preferred.
   Alternatively, the step itself can override the shell by
   specifying an alternate shell using a #! line, using the
   same syntax that would be used for UNIX systems.  For
   example:
      #!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe
      print "Hello, from $$^X\n";
