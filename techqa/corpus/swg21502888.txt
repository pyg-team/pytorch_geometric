QUESTION
 How can I rename an existing object server? 

ANSWER
Follow below steps to rename an existing Object Server name. Suppose you want to rename NCOMS to BCOMS.

1. Define the new Object Server name (BCOMS), hostname and port in the $NCHOME/etc/omni.dat file. 

2. Generate the interface files by running $NCHOME/bin/nco_igen command.

3. Create the new Object Server name with the $OMNIHOME/bin/nco_dbinit command. This 
will create a default object server database and props file.  * 


4. Update the new Object Server props file ($OMNIHOME/etc/BCOMS.props) based on the props file for existing object server (NCOMS). 

5. Backup existing object server using below command from nco_sql command. This will create two tab files (master_store.tab, and table_store.tab) in /tmp dir.  *

 * 


6. Make sure newly created object server (BCOMS) is stopped. 

7. Copy above two tab files to $OMNIHOME/db/BCOMS/ directory. 

8. Start up the new object server (BCOMS) using nco_objserv command. If it's using the same port as the old object server then you need to shutdown the old one first. 

After renaming the object server you may need to modify configuration files for other applications using the object server. Here are a few examples: 

1. For probes, you need to change the Server property to the new Object Server name and restart them. 

2. For Webtop/Webgui, you need to change the data source definition file below if the port is different, but that uses hostname/IP only, not the Object Server name. After this restart TIP.<TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/etc/webtop/datasources/ncwDataSourceDefinitions.xml
