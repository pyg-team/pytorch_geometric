Title: IBM Installation Manager and IBM Packaging Utility GUI crashes while advancing through wizard screens on recent updates of RHEL 6 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Installation Manager and IBM Packaging Utility GUI crashes on RHEL 6 updates 5 and 6 during the installation of a product and while advancing through the wizard screens. 

SYMPTOM
The GUI crashes and a JVM termination window pops up with the following text: 


JVM terminated. Exit code=1 

/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/jre_7.0.0.sr6_20131213_1238/ 

jre/bin/java 

-Xms40m 

-Xmx512m





CAUSE
An Eclipse defect, tracked here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441705 [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441705], causes the crash. 
According to the Eclipse bug description, the crash occurs only on Linux systems where the GTK version is "2.24" or higher and the "cairo" library's version is lower then "1.9.4".


To verify that this is indeed the cause for the crash, execute: 

 


$ rpm -q gtk2


Example output: 


gtk2-2.24.23-6.el6.s390x 

gtk2-2.24.23-6.el6.s390




 


$ rpm -q cairo


Example output: 


cairo-1.8.8-3.1.el6.s390x 

cairo-1.8.8-3.1.el6.s390




 

Other things to looks for: 

1.) Run the Installation Manager from command line and after it crashes look for this line in the output: 

 java: cairo-misc.c:380: _cairo_operator_bounded_by_source: Assertion `NOT_REACHED' failed. 

2.) After the crash, the JVM produces a "javacore.<xxxxxxx,xxxx,xxxx,xxxx.txt" dump file. Searching this file for "cairo", you should see a stack trace looking like this:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue is fixed in IBM Installation Manager 1.8.2. 

If, for some reason, using IBM Installation Manager 1.8.2 is not option, it is possible to workaround the issue by upgrading the "cairo" library. 

Download a version of the cairo library that is at least "1.9.4" 

x86 64-bit example: ftp://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/sourceforge/f/fu/fuduntu-el/el6/current/TESTING/RPMS/cairo-1.10.2-3.el6.x86_64.rpm and execute: 

 * 
 * 
   rpm -U cairo-1.10.2-3.el6.x86_64.rpm
   


x86 32-bit example: ftp://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/sourceforge/f/fu/fuduntu-el/el6/current/TESTING/RPMS/cairo-1.10.2-3.el6.i686.rpm and execute: 

 * 
 * 
   rpm -U cairo-1.10.2-3.el6.i686.rpm
   


Another option is to not run the Installation Manager in GUI mode but in Command-line, Console or Web UI mode.
