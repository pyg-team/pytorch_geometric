QUESTION
 How do I Enable/Disable Secure Gateway Communications 

ANSWER
Please note that secure gateway communication must be either disabled or enabled on all nodes to work correctly.
Post deployment you can disable or enable stunnel by running the following on the Data Server and Gateway:

1) /usr/local/storediq/bin/util/stunnelcfg [disable|enable]

(Note the default without a parameter is to enable stunnel, in this case we want to enable /usr/local/storediq/bin/util/stunnelcfg enable )

2) Reboot both Dataserver(s) and Gateway after the above change is made


On the Appstack by run this command:

1) /siq/bin/appstackcfg

2) Check or uncheck the "Enable secure gateway communication" box to enable or disable stunnel (in this case, make sure it's checked)

3) Reboot the Appstack

Note too that you should NOT edit the appstack's /etc/siq/gateway.yaml file directly. 
You should only use /siq/bin/appstackcfg to set up the gateway.yaml configuration
