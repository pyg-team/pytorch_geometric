Title: IBM Enabling Login Trace for IBM InfoSphere Information Server in Websphere Application Server (WAS) Console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Information Server Web Console Login problems.

Unable to log in to ISF admin console 

SYMPTOM
Various errors when attempting login to Information Server Web Console. The directory configuration seems to be correct but you are still not able to login in to ISF admin console.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To debug further, you can turn on debug traces in ASBIdentityLoginModule. From WebSphere administrative console, 

 1. Go to Security -> Global security -> JAAS Configuration -> System logins. Click RMI_INBOUND -> JAAS login modules -> com.ascential.acs.security.auth.modules.websphere.ASBIdentityLoginModule -> Custom properties. Click New, and fill the form with Name as debug, Value as true, click OK. 
 2. Go to Security -> Global security -> JAAS Configuration -> System logins. Click WEB_INBOUND -> JAAS login modules -> com.ascential.acs.security.auth.modules.websphere.ASBIdentityLoginModule -> Custom properties. Click New, and fill the form with Name as debug, Value as true, click OK. 
 3. Click Ok, save link in the top screen and then save button to commit the change. 
 4. Restart WAS


Now if you make a call to the login method of ISF authentication service from your test clients or you login using ISF admin console, then you see a lot of information like principalid of the user being logged in, user groups, user roles, etc... in the Websphere SystemOut.log. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use SystemOut.log to debug login problem.
