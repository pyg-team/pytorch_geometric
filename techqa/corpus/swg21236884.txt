QUESTION
 

Solaris 10 Zones provide separate environments on a computer and enables applications to remain logically separated from one another. You can virtualize the operating system (OS) multiple times based on one kernel. 

For Lotus Domino to run properly in this environment, you must tell the OS which part of the kernel is accessible from the zone.


ANSWER
 

To do this:


 1. Install the Solaris 10 operating system. 
 2. Create zone configurations. 
 3. Install Domino 7.0.1 in zone 0.  * In the global zone, remove the /dev/listen symlink. 
     * Also in the global zone, add the following line to the end of /etc/devlink. tab: 
       type=ddi_pseudo;name=listen;addr=0;minor=listen \M0
       
       
       Note: The character before the backslash is a tab, not a space; see comments in the file.) 
       
        
       
       
     * Run devfsadm and check that it created a new/dev/listen link.
       You may need to work around this several times, with different sequences of "rem_drv listen", reboots, and "add_drv listen." It may be that the combination that works is rem_drv/reboot/devfsadm, but this has not been confirmed. 
     * Also in the global zone, use zonecfg to configure a local zone.
       Along with the files ystems and everything else, use the subcommands:
       add device
       set match=/dev/listen
       
       
       end to export the raw /dev/listen device to the local zone. 
       
        
       
       
     * Use zoneadm to install and boot the new local zone, and zlogin to log into it. 
     * As root in the local zone, check that /dev/listen exists (It is an actual device file in the LZ, not a symlink.) 
     * Give all users read/write permission: 
       chmod 666 /dev/listen 
       
        
       
       
     * Switch to the Domino user account, cd to the server directory, and launch Domino.
