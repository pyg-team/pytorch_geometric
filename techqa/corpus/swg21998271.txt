CVEID:CVE-2014-0050 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0050]
DESCRIPTION:Apache Commons FileUpload, as used in Apache Tomcat, Solr, and other products is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of Content-Type HTTP header for multipart requests by MultipartStream.java. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted Content-Type header to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90987 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/90987]for the current score
