Version 2.1.2.4 includes fixes for these security vulnerabilities:

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2179 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2179]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending specially crafted DTLS record fragments to fill up buffer queues, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to open a large number of simultaneous connections and consume all available memory resources.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2181 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2181]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the DTLS replay protection implementation. By sending a specially crafted sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause valid packets to be dropped.

CVEID: CVE-2016-2182 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2182]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds write in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted value to cause the application to crash.

CVEID: CVE-2016-3485 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3485]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Networking component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5387 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5387]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to redirect HTTP traffic of CGI application, caused by the failure to protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. By using a specially-crafted Proxy header in a HTTP request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect outbound HTTP traffic to arbitrary proxy server. This is also known as the "HTTPOXY" vulnerability.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5542 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5542]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5573 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5573]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Hotspot component has high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and high availability impact.

CVEID: CVE-2016-5597 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5597]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.

CVEID: CVE-2016-6302 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6302]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length by the tlsdecrypt_ticket function A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a ticket that is too short to cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By repeatedly requesting renegotiation, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large OCSP Status Request extension to consume all available memory resources.

CVEID: CVE-2016-6306 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6306]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing message length checks when parsing certificates. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2016-6309 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6309]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a use-after-free when handling message sizes. By sending an overly large message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVEID: CVE-2016-7052 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7052]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a missing CRL sanity check. By attempting to use CRLs, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
