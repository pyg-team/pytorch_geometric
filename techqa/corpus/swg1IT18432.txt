APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running as a system services with Streams releases 4.1.1.1
   or 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the
   user environment may have various errors.
   For example the database toolkit might show the following error
   if it does not pick up the ODBCINI enviornment variable:
   "An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code
   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver
   Manager]Connnection does not exist."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set environment variables directly in the instance with:
   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance>
   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
