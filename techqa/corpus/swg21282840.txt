Title: IBM Trace node does not throw errors when trace file path can not be found - United States

Text:
Trace node throw errors TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) Trace node does not find the File Path specified in its properties, it does not throw errors. 

CAUSE
The trace node is designed to not flood the user log with duplicate messages.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the filepath is not found, the trace node will throw an error for only the first time a message passes through. It will not repeat the same log entry for subsequent messages. To see the message again, restart the execution group, as this will create a new process, where no messages have passed through.
