 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If I set my browser language to a bidirectional language such as Arabic or Hebrew, and open the search application or text miner application, why are some page controls and text not rendered correctly as bidirectional output and why are some labels not translated? 

CAUSE
Your operating system and web browser determine how bidirectional page controls and text are rendered.

ANSWER
When you open an application in Arabic, you might notice these differences in browser behavior: 

 * Depending on the Windows version, browser mode, and the document mode in which you run Internet Explorer 8, numbers might not be displayed in Arabic format. For example, if you open the Preferences > Facet tab in the text miner application and click the Number of results per page menu, the number format of menu items is in Arabic but the number format of the displayed value is in Arabic Indic.
   
   Note: The provided search application and text miner application are tested with the Internet Explorer 8 document mode set to Internet Explorer 8 Standard. In some environments, the default browser setting might be Internet Explorer 8 Compatibility mode. To avoid differences in behavior, click Tools > Compatibility View Settings in your Internet Explorer 8 browser and clear the Display intranet sites in Compatibility View check box. 
   
   
   
 * In a Firefox browser, the vertical bars for scrolling through query results are aligned on the right sides of the scrollable area instead of on the left. You can see this behavior, for example, if you scroll through a long page of query results or expand subfacets in the facet navigation tree until a vertical bar is displayed. 
   
 * Ellipses are used in the banner of the application to indicate that the value of a long collection name is truncated. Depending on whether the collection name was specified in English or Arabic, the position of the ellipses might appear out of place. 
   
 * On the Preferences > Dashboard tab in the text miner application, collection names might appear to wrap incorrectly. 
   
 * In the Trends view and Deviations view of the text miner application, the y-axis of the trends index or deviations index is not always displayed. You might see this behavior if you applied the Bidirectional Language Testfix to IBM Content Analytics Version 2.2 Fix Pack 2. 
   
 * Pressing the Home or End key does not always move the cursor to the expected position. For example, if you save a query and then press Home or End in the Query box, the cursor does not move to the start of the query terms. You might see this behavior if you applied the Bidirectional Language Testfix to IBM Content Analytics Version 2.2 Fix Pack 2. 
   
 * If you save a query, the default name for the query is search_numbers, such as search_1312895293, and the string search is not translated. If you do not want to use this default saved query name, specify a different name before you save the query. 
   
 * In the Dashboard view of the text miner application, the titles of charts and the labels Layout 1 and Layout 2 appear in English. The facet label My Keywords in the facet navigation tree also appears in English. This behavior is a known limitation in IBM Content Analytics, version 2.2.
