 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I need to migrate SCA database on a new SQL Server 

ANSWER

1) Stop the SCA service via the Windows services manager in the server where SCA application was installed in.

2) Backup and Delete your database configuration file: '<TEMAinstallation directory>\config\database.yml'.

3) Start the SCA service via the Windows services manager. 

4) Access the SCA web interface from the SCA hostserver. You'll be able to re-enter your new SCA database connection info. 

Note :- Due to the complexity and risks of migrating IEM Servers, it is strongly recommended that a DBA Technician help in performing the SCA SQL Server Migration process.
We kindly suggest you you to implement the procedure in a test environment before since this is un-supported scenario.
