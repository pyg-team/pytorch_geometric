APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SAP agent version: 7.1.1
   
   Following attributes of PI/XI XML Message Logs are used for
   internal processing by SAP monitoring agent and do not provide
   data to Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP).
   Attrbute group: PI/XI XML Message Logs
   Attributes: Period End, Period Start
   
   Starting with 7.1.1 Interim Fix 0001 (7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001),
   the above attributes are removed from
   "XML Message Monitoring-> XML Messages Logs" view on TEP.
   However these can be added back using query editor.
   These attributes need to be "hidden" so that these are not
   available to TEP user for use in workspace and situation editor.
   
   Recreation steps:
   Access XML Message Monitoring workspace of PI node, and  open
   properties for XML Messages Logs view.
   Select "Click here to assign a query". The Period Start and
   Period End columns are present and selectable. If selected,
   these contain no data to TEP view.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ignore the Period Start and Period End attributes.
