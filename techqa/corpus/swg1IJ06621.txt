APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Netcool Operations Insights Related Event grouping can be
   applied to scope based grouping groups to create super groups,
   where scope-based grouping parent events become child events of
   the Related Event parent.  The scope based grouping automations
   now support the automatic propagation of the child and
   grandchild event details to the super parent journal, so that
   the super parent will have all the underlying event details,
   when ticketed.  The scope based grouping automations also now
   create multiple journal entries immediately, instead of just one
   per cycle.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers that have Netcool Operations Insights want to be   *
   * able to use both scope-based grouping as well as the         *
   * analytics-based grouping (Related Events) together, rather   *
   * than one or the other.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Customers have previously had to choose to use one or the    *
   * other of the two grouping mechanisms offered by Netcool      *
   * Operations Insights.  They want to be able to leverage both  *
   * capabilities at the same time, on the same event data.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Customers can now apply tribal and environmental knowledge   *
   * leveraging scope-based event grouping, to see an initial     *
   * reduction in rows presented to operators, and tickets being  *
   * opened.  They can then apply Related Events analytics to the *
   * scope-based event grouping parent events to group the        *
   * groups, thereby further reducing the rows presented to       *
   * operators and tickets opened.                                *
