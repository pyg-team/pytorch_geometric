QUESTION
 In the case details page I have 3 columns. In the right column I have the IBM Case Data widget and under that I have two custom widgets. Normally these widgets do not overlap and changing the width of this column of widgets keeps all the widgets the same width. I have a user that has shown that the widgets in the right-side column sometimes overlap vertically and the widths of the widgets in this column are different. This makes reading the Case Data widget unreadable. 

How do I restore or change the widget widths for this user? 


CAUSE
The user's widget sizes are corrupted.

ANSWER
From the GUI perspective, the only page layout that allows changing the widget width setting is "Free Form Layout". See the reference from Business Space Infocenter site below. 
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_7.5.1/com.ibm.wbpm.bspace.ic.main.doc/tasks/using/resizingwidgets.html?cp=SSFTBX_7.5.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_7.5.1/com.ibm.wbpm.bspace.ic.main.doc/tasks/using/resizingwidgets.html?cp=SSFTBX_7.5.1]

If the page layout for the widget is not using "Free Form Layout", there is no documented way to clear a user's values or resize the widget width parameter for the specific user. According to Business Support team, BSP_USER_DATA_T is used for storing user specific data. Each row is created for each user to keep information on a particular user such as last page visited, widget sizes, and page access information etc... And this information is stored as Binary Large Object (BLOB). To restore the user's corrupted widget size setting, you must delete the affected user record in the Business Space BSP_USER_DATA_T database table. Once the affected user 's record is deleted from the table, when the affected user logs in next time, he or she will get the default values including the widget sizes configured for all users.

It is important to back up the Business Space database BSP_USER_DATA_T table prior to deleting the affected user 's record from the BSP_USER_DATA_T table. And you should perform testing in a lower environment prior to doing it in the production environment.
