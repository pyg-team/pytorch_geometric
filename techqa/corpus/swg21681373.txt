HOD; http server TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS) 8 and 8.5 to work with IBM Rational Host On-Demand (HOD)? 

CAUSE
A known install problem prevents the detection of IBM HTTP Server and the automatic update to the httpd.conf file during the Host On-Demand install on Distributed platforms.

ANSWER
Host On-Demand 11.0.6 and higher is supported with the IBM HTTP Server 8 and HOD 11.0.8 and higher is supported with IHS 8.5. Since the HOD install does not detect the web server, you need to update the httpd.conf file manually. 

 1. Find and edit httpd.conf file.
    
 2. Append the following statements to the bottom of the file, assuming HOD is installed in the default location:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Alias /hod/ "C:/Program Files (x86)/IBM/HostOnDemand/HOD/"
   <Directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/IBM/HostOnDemand/HOD">
   Options None
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
   </Directory>
 * 
   For iOS:
   Alias /hod/ /QIBM/ProdData/hostondemand/HOD/
   <Directory /QIBM/ProdData/hostondemand/HOD>
   <LimitExcept GET POST>
   order deny,allow
   deny from none
   </LimitExcept>
   AllowOverride None
   UseCanonicalName Off
   HostNameLookups off
   Options +FollowSymLinks
   </Directory> 
 * 
   For AIX, Linux: 
 * Alias /hod/ /opt/IBM/HostOnDemand/HOD/
   <Directory /opt/IBM/HostOnDemand/HOD/>
   Options None
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
   </Directory> 
 * 


3. Restart the Web Server.
