   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The information centers for WebSphere   *
   *                      Application Server Version 6.0, 6.1,    *
   *                      and 7.0 do not adquately explain how    *

   *                      servlet when the serve-by-class-name    *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The information centers for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 do not adequately explain how to
   disable the IBMTrackerDebug servlet when the
   serve-by-class-name feature is enabled.  The IBMTrackerDebug
   servlet displays the current configuration and statistics
   related to session tracking and this operation can interfere
   with the serve-by-class-name feature.  Having a way to disable
   the IBMTrackerDebug servlet would be helpful in this situation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ?HTTP session manager troubleshooting tips? topic will be
   updated to explain how to disable the IBMTrackerDebug servlet
   when the serve-by-class-name feature is enabled.  A note that
   follows is added to this topic explaining the way to disable
   the IBMTrackerDebug servlet.
   
   Note: If you have enabled the serve-by-class-name feature and
   want to disable the IBMTrackerDebug servlet, then specify the
   web container custom property,
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.donotservebyclassname.
   See Web container custom properties for more information on
   how to set this property.
   
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the current
   documentation before you read this text. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   and select the version and product that is appropriate for
   your WebSphere Application Server environment. The modified
   documentation will be available in the July, 2009 update to
   the Information Centers.
