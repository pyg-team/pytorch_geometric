 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM FileNet Process Designer did not launch after IBM Content Navigator patch upgrade 

SYMPTOM
After upgrading Content Navigator from 2.0.3.7 to 2.0.3.8, when launching Process Designer from the Content Navigator, user was prompted for a password. After entering a password, the login failed with the following error:

[10/24/16 16:09:18:168 CDT] 000001c9 webapp E com.ibm.ws.
webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: [Servlet Error]-
[PluginServlet]: java.io.IOException: Plugin resource not found!
at com.ibm.ecm.util.PluginUtil.getPluginResourceDate(PluginUtil.java:
1692) 

However, Administrative Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) was able to launch the Process Configuration Console (PCC) without the issue, and work items were accessible from Content Navigator. 


CAUSE
After the CPEAppletsPlugin.jar was properly registered in the Content Navigator administrator tool under the Plug-ins node, in a case that the Process Designer was not launched from the default desktop, the "IBM Content Platform Engine Applets Support" should have been selected for both the desktop where it was used and the default desktop. The reason why it was necessary on the default desktop was unknown. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To enable the process engine applets support, 

1. Open IBM Content Navigator Admin desktop. e.g. icnhostName:<port>/navigator/?desktop=admin
2. Open the Desktops tab and open the default desktop (marked with a star)
3. Select the General tab, and scroll down to the Plug-ins section and expand it.
4. Under the selected "Select the deployed plug-ins to enable for use with this desktop",
make sure "IBM Content Platform Engine Applets Support" is selected.
5. Save the change
