ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Message not entirely shown in source view of BPC Explorer
   .
   If variables are associated to the input or output of an
   activity in a BPEL process using the data type mapping, the BPC
   Explorer may not shown the entire message in the source view.
   This is due to the fact that non-containment references are used
   to represented the variable content in the WSDL message when
   data type mapping is used.
   The fix makes sure that these non-containment references are
   converted into containment references before serializing the
   message content for the source view in the BPC Explorer.
