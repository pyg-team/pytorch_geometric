   occurred at offset X'23E2' in module DFHDSAT.  The program check
   abend0C4 is a PIC10 segment translation exception.  The failing
   instruction is a CLC ( D507 A008 32CC ) with R10 containing
   ebcidic.  R10 was loaded from R12 ( 58A0 C068 ) attmepting to
   load the DSAT_TCB_TOKEN_P.  R12 area appears to be overlaid.

   ****************************************************************
   When CICS performs a warm or emergency restart it calls DFHW2RP
   to restore resource definitions from the CATALOG in routine
   RECOVER_DEFINITIONS. DFHW2RP makes a CHANGE_MODE call onto
   the QR TCB. Its initial TCB_TOKEN is not saved and on the way
   out of RECOVER_DEFINITIONS it attempts to return to an initial
   TCB_TOKEN that has not been set and most likely points to an
   invalid TCB_TOKEN or unreadable storage, resulting in CICS
   reporting either the INVALID_TCB_TOKEN or an 0C4 ABEND.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHW2RP recover_definitions routine has been changed so that it
   stores the initial TCB_TOKEN. This allows the CHANGE_MODE on
   exit to work correctly.
