PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the Maximo/SCCD Start Center, the Chinese translation for the Route column in the Workflow Inbox/Assignment portlet is confusing. 

SYMPTOM
From the Maximo login page, select the Chinese language to login to Maximo. 

From the Start Center, check the Workflow Inbox/Assignments portlet. The Route column is translated as '检修路线' in Chinese environment. This translation is making users feel confused by its function.

The 'Route' here functions the same as 'Route Workflow' highlighted below in the Maximo application toolbar.

The Route in Inbox/Assignments is not the same concept as the Route in the PM and Routes application. The one in PM and Routes application has a different meaning altogether.

CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR IV76926



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
For Maximo users, we understand what the 'Route' in the Inbox/Assignments portlet does, but there is no way for the translators to understand that 'Route' in the Inbox/Assignments portlet has a different meaning from the 'Route' in the Routes application. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
'Route' in that portlet can be found in the maxmessages_0003.xliff. 

Users can update the database (where msgkey = 'inbxroutelbl' and MSGGROUP = 'startcntr') to change the value to a correct Chinese translation as a workaround. 

 

We suggest to change it from '检修路线' to '发送工作流'.
