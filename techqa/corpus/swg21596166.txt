Title: IBM Web server plug-in configuration propagation might fail in WebSphere Application Server - United States

Text:
WASV85RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Web server plug-in configuration propagation might fail. 

SYMPTOM
You might see an error message that the web server plug-in configuration propagation has failed. The message can be in log files if propagation is set to run as a background task automatically. 

Propagation must occur using node synchronization for the error to occur. If you manually copy the files or use IBM HTTP Server administration, the error does not occur.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the web server is a managed node, check that the configuration has been properly pushed to the web server.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can run a manual synchronization of the web server to push the configuration to the target machine. If it does not synchronize correctly, you can manually move the updated files to the desired target machine. 


This issue is resolved with PM63690 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63690]. Apply the fix to avoid the problem.
