Title: IBM "The host appears to be running but port "-1" does not respond. " error when testing connection to Rule Execution Server from Decision Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the Decision Center Configure tab, under Manage Servers, when I test the connection to the server instance of the Rule Execution Server, I see the error:
Test failed for server foo. The host appears to be running but port "-1" does not respond. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that the server connection details are correctly specified ( hostname, portnumber, username/password) in the Decision Center Configure tab, under Manage Servers.


 * Ensure that you set the URL of the Rule Execution Server to be http://<host>:<port>/res, not http://<host>:<port>/testing 
 * Check that the port is not being used by another process [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443946]. If it is, stop the other process. 
 * Make sure that the user belongs to a Decision Center group that has privileges [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.dcenter.bu.econsole%2Ftopics%2Ftsk_config_deploy_servers.html] to access a RES server 
 * Make sure that the SSP application (jrules-ssp-<appserver>.ear) has been installed correctly on the application server, and has been started. 
 * Test the availability of Decision Validation Services by typing the URL in your browser: http://<host>:<port>/testing 
 * Make sure there is no firewall blocking the HTTP/HTTPS connection from Decision Center to Rule Execution Server
