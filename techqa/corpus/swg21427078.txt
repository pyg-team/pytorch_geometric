QUESTION
 Where do I find a list of status codes returned by dsjob when I run a job? 

ANSWER
You can find information about dsjob return codes in the file jobcontrol.h stored in the 'dsinclude' folder in each project folder. Open the file and search for the section beginning with "* Possible return values for token DSJ.STATUS:" to see the list of possible status codes, and their meaning.
