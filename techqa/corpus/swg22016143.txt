Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities affect db2exmig and db2exfmt tools shipped with IBM® Db2® (CVE-2018-1544, CVE-2018-1565) - United States

Text:
db2exmig; db2exfmt; CVE-2018-1544; CVE-2018-1565 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Db2 tools db2exmig and db2exfmt are affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. As installed these tools do not run with elevated privileges (setuid) and when called directly the vulnerability does not lead to privilege escalation. However, if a customer’s own application or script runs with elevated privileges and executes db2exmig or db2exfmt, the vulnerability may lead to privilege escalation. These tools are not called by Db2 in such a manner. The vulnerability only exists for local users, it cannot be remotely exploited.
