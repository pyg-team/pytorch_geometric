APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WCM search seedlist can fail to detect any newly syndicated
   published items when an incremental crawl is performed.
   
   
   This can occur when:
   
   - a content is published on the syndicator server
   
   - an incremental crawl is performed on the subscriber
   
   - the published item is syndicated to the subscriber
   
   - when the seedlist is crawled incrementally on the subscriber
   again, the newly syndicated published item is not detected
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Perform a full crawl once the syndication has completed.
