QUESTION
Can you map multiple LDAP groups to a Jazz role in a Jazz Team Server in IBM Rational Team Concert? 

ANSWER
Mapping multiple ldap groups to a Jazz role in a Jazz Team Server environment is supported, however, if your Jazz Team Server runs on Apache Tomcat Application sever, since mapping multiple LDAP groups to a single J2EE role is not supported by Tomcat, you will not be able to perform this type of mapping. Websphere Application Server supports mapping multiple LDAP groups to a J2EE role, therefore, you can configure this type of mapping for your Jazz Team Server runs on an IBM Websphere Application server.
