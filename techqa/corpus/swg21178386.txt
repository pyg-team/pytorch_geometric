Title: IBM Network Time Protocol support with WebSphere Edge Components - United States

Text:
NTP network time protocol change support Edge load balancer HA TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is not clear if Network Time Protocol (NTP) is supported with WebSphere Edge Components. NTP can cause unexpected results within Edge Components. Due to this behavior IBM cannot support the use of NTP with Edge Components. 

CAUSE
Development has reported that a "sleuth" mode set within NTP can restrict the change in time to .1 seconds. This might allow Edge Components to run without problems, but any time change related problems encountered will not be supported other than with "best effort" support.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Disable NTP on the systems running the Edge Components: 

 * For AIX
   "ntpdate" is used to control NTP functions.
   
   
 * For Solaris
   Simply remove the ntp rc startup script with "rm /etc/rc2.d/S74xntpd".
   
   
 * For Linux
   The "ntpd" daemon is used and can be found and killed with "ps -ef|grep ntpd" then "kill ntpd_pid#".
   
   
 * For Microsoft Windows
   It can be omitted as the "Windows Time" service has to be configured to use this feature.
