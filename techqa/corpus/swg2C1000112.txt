CVEID: CVE-2015-1283 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1283]
DESCRIPTION: Multiple integer overflows in the XML_GetBuffer function in Expat through 2.1.0, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 and other products, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted XML data, a related issue to CVE-2015-2716.
CVSS Base Score: 6.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/104964 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/104964] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-3183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3183]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTP Server is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, caused by a chunk header parsing flaw in the apr_brigade_flatten() function. By sending a specially-crafted request in a malformed chunked header to the Apache HTTP server, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
