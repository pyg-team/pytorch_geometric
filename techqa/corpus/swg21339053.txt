PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Can you force Cognos 8 / IBM Cognos ReportNet to open a new window when running a report? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This can be set in two places in Cognos ReportNet and chosen as an option when clicking on a link in Internet Explorer:

In Report Studio, go to Tools, Options, and clear the Reuse Report Viewer checkbox.

In the Drill-Throughs properties window in Report Studio, select the Open in new window option to have the child report open in a new window when running a child report from a parent report. This can be set for each Drillthrough.

In Cognos Connection, if you want Report Viewer to open in a new browser window when you click on a Report link, right-click the link and select Open in new window from the popup menu. This is Internet Explorer functionality. Cognos ReportNet does not have a way to force a new
window when a report is opened.
