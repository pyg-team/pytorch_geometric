   URIs of links were being generated incorrectly.
   The generated URIs incorrectly contain the following text:
   '%3CWCM_RP%3E'
   Clicking the links resulted in 404 html error codes.

   URIs of links were being generated incorrectly.
   Clicking the links resulted in 404 html error codes.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When rendering links, the legacy Remote Rendering Portlet
   replaces for the token '<WCM_RP>' in URIs.
   However the the token was being incorrectly url-encoded, and
   therefore was being rendered out as is.
   Updated code to not urlencode '<WCM_RP>' token.
