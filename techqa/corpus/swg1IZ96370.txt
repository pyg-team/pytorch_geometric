ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TNPM 1.3A (2.8.0.0) - Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Tech Pack,
   officially
   according to the user documentation (page 5) supports
   communication /
   collection from
   Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Server Release 6
   Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Server Release 6.1
   Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Server Release 7
   
   This pack is basically designed to support SAM v8 and the
   customer discovered that this Teck Pack tries to query for
   classes that do not exist on a SAM Releases 6 or 6.1.So, this
   means that this pack does not support pre SAM 7 release. But
   the customer is requesting to a have pack that supports all SAM
   versions as defined in the documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following suggestions provided by L3:
   
   
   The issue is that we added features that use classes from the
   SAM that are not in 6.1 and earlier.  This can cause an
   inventory issue (i.e. it will not complete) when run against an
   earlier version.  4.3-X (what the customer is currently running)
   was
   certified against 7.0 and also therefore 6.1, but then the 4.3-Y
   pack, where this functionality was introduced, was certified
   against 8.0 and also backwards compatibility-tested at
   certification against the previous version, which was 7.0.
   
   There are a couple routes we could take here:
   
   1) There is a good chance that the 4.3-X SAM pack works against
   8.0.  We could do a relatively quick test and see, and they
   could keep using that as they are now.
   
   2) It would be relatively straightforward, though a little bit
   of work, to add conditionals to the pack so that the offending
   items could be skipped based on configuration.  This could maybe
   be done with the existing config items, or the addition of an
   items where the SAM server version is configured.  It might also
   be possible to detect the SAM version automatically when we
   connect to it, but that might require some DC work.  The
   infrastructure that woudl help out with this may have been added
   later than 2.8.0.0, maybe in the 2.9.0.0 version, but I would
   have to check.
   
   For #2 another issue is that the customer is currently testing
   to go to
   2.8.0.0 (1.3A), and that means we would have to make a fix for
   that version as well as 2.9.0.0, which is a pain.
   
   
   
   For the doc issue, that is reasonable, but not necessarily a big
   deal.  When we update the doc, we could have it say the pack is
   only compatible with 7.0 and 8.0, thus eliminating the other
   issue discussed here.  If I used smileys, I would put one here.
   
   
   
   As to this:
   
    Can you please investigate / escalate this issue, as the
   customer - in-line with the documentation and advise sort from
   IBM will be supporting collection from  multiple SAMs
   concurrently, those that will be running Release 6,   6.1,   7
   and 8 at the same time.
   
   
   
   We really do not support running against multiple SAM versions
   on one Proviso setup.  In this case, we "figured out" how to
   make it work, but when we ahd the call at the time Craig was
   very clear that it was not supported and we were just doing it
   to help them.  Not sure if this affects the situation or not
   
   
   *** COULD NOT PROVIDE THE CORRECT COMPONENT AND SYSTEM RELEASES
   AS THE CURRENT CCWIN DOES NOT SUPPORT ***
   
   The correct component release:
   
   TNPM 1.3A Alcatel 5620 SAM Technology Pack
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In the Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Technology Pack, the updates for
   SAM Server v8 broke support for versions of SAM Server pre v7.
   Because it queries for classes that do not exist in v6 and v6.1
   This issue is resolved in the latest release of this Tech Pack
   version 2.9.1.0
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Technology Pack v2.9.1.0
