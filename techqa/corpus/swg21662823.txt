CAUSE
The Rational License Key Administrator is unable to handle licenses with IPv6 addresses as hostid.


ENVIRONMENT
Applies to all instances of LKAD installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Procedure:


 1. Navigate to the installation directory of IBM Rational License Key server (RLKS)
    
    
 2. Open the file rational_server_perm.dat / rational_server_temp.dat in a text editor
    
    
 3. Copy and Paste the contents from the newly generated license file, using the IPv6 address to the rational_server_perm.dat / rational_server_temp.dat
    
    
 4. Save & Re-read license file to run new license file
    
    LKAD should now reflect the newly imported license files.
    


Note: If the floating license file being imported is a permanent license, the default file to which the license needs to manually imported is "rational_server_perm.dat" . If there is a license file already already in use generated with a different hostid, this would need to be overwritten completely. In case of Temporary licenses, there is no hostid specific licenses.
