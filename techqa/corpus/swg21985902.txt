APA TRACE TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Do you want to launch from any OMEGAMON product to IBM Application Performance Analyzer? 

CAUSE
Provide sample to launch from any OMEGAMON product to IBM Application Performance Analyzer.

ANSWER
IBM Application Performance Analyzer (APA) is a trace analysis facility for various workloads running on z/OS, including z/OS tasks, CICS, IMS, MQ, DB2 and more. This describes how to enable the interface to invoke APA from OMEGAMON. 

PTF UA82064 (APAR OA50020) delivers three sample files that are installed into the TKANSAM target library. Copy these files to appropriate libraries, edit them to meet the requirements of your environment, and invoke APA using a console command. APA may be invoked from OMEGAMON using the Take Action option from a situation.
