Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in MD5 Signature and Hash Algorithm affects WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus (CVE-2015-7575) - United States

Text:
WMB IIB SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The MD5 “SLOTH” vulnerability on TLS 1.2 affects WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Integration Bus V9, V10 

WebSphere Message Broker V8

REMEDIATION/FIXES
For users of ODBC SSL using the DataDirect drivers:

You might be vulnerable to SLOTH vulnerability, if you have not applied APAR IT09602 released in August 2015. (Please refer the bulletin at 
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21958955 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21958955] for more details)



Product VRMF APAR Remediation/Fix IBM Integration Bus V10 IT09602 The APAR is available in fix pack 10.0.0.2 and above. IBM Integration Bus V9 IT09602 The APAR is available in fix pack 9.0.0.5 and above. WebSphere Message Broker

The APAR is targeted to be available in fix pack 8.0.0.7. For unsupported versions of the product, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.  

You should verify thst applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix prevents the currently-practical SLOTH attack against the RSA-MD5 client authentication. IBM recommends that you avoid using ciphers which use an MD5 or SHA-1 signature hash. 

The planned maintenance release dates for WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus are available at :
