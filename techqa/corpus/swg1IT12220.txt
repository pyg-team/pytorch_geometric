APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On windows, the iib command sets environment variables globally.
   If you want to run against different levels of broker
   then it fails because the environment is already populated.
   This APAR allows you to set an environment variable which
   makes the environment setting only local to the iib command
   being run.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Version 10 using the iib
   command on Windows.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows on x86-64 platform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   On Windows, the 'iib' command sets the product environment
   variables globally based on the installation that the command is
   first run from. If you switch to a different installation
   directory, for example at a different fix pack level, and runs
   the iib command again, it will still use the environment from
   the original iib run and therefore the results may not be as
   expected.
   
   This APAR allows the user to set an environment variable which
   makes the environment setting local to the iib command being
   run.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now allows a user to stop the environment variables
   from being set as global when using the 'iib' command on
   Windows.
   
   To achieve this, set the environment variable IIB_SETLOCAL
   before running the command.
   
   For example:
   set IIB_SETLOCAL=yes
   C:\Program Files\IBM\IIB\10.0.0.1\iib mqsiservice -v
   C:\Program Files\IBM\IIB\10.0.0.2\iib mqsiservice -v
   
   This will run the mqsiservice command from the different fix
   pack installations.
