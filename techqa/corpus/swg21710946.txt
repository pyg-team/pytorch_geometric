VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0286]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp function when attempting to compare ASN.1 Boolean types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash any certificate verification operation and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101666 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101666] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0287 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0287]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error related to the reuse of a structure in ASN.1 parsing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an invalid write to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101668 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101668] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0289 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0289]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle missing outer ContentInfo by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blob to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101669] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0209 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0209]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the d2i_ECPrivateKey or EVP_PKCS82PKEY function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101674 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101674] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0288 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0288]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the X509_to_X509_REQ function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101675] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
