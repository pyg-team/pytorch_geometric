VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7436 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7436]
DESCRIPTION: Add/remove users to/from an external (namespace) group could leave them with old permissions.
CVSS Base Score: 2.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107961 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107961] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-7435 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7435]
DESCRIPTION: BackURL prefixed with white-space skips CAF validation. 
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107960 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107960] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-7450 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7450]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Commons Collections could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the deserialization of data with Java InvokerTransformer class. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Java code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107918 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107918] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-4872 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4872]
DESCRIPTION: An invalid (too short) RSA key might be accepted under certain circumstances. The fix ensures that invalid RSA keys are rejected correctly. This issue affects Java deployments which use SSL/TLS communication and/or the java.security.cert.CertPath API.
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
