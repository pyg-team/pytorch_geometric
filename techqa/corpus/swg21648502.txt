Title: IBM Large syntax files in IBM SPSS Statistics very slow to navigate - United States

Text:
syntax file spss large hang editor TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using IBM SPSS Statistics. I have a syntax file that is over 1 MB in size. When I open the file, I can see the syntax commands but SPSS seems to hang and I am not able to navigate within it. After a couple minutes, I can them move about in my file. What is happening? 

SYMPTOM
large syntax file. hang on opening. slow to navigate


CAUSE
This behavior is a combination of the large file and having all the options enabled for the syntax window. SPSS is loading all this information on launch of the file, hence the inability to click. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This behavior is a combination of the large file and having all the options enabled for the syntax window. SPSS is loading all this information on launch of the file, hence the inability to click. To speed up the load time, launch SPSS and go into Edit->options and click the Syntax Editor tab. Uncheck the options that are unnecessary for you, for example Display Color Coding. Click Apply and OK. Now you will be able to navigate the large syntax file sooner without the long delay.
