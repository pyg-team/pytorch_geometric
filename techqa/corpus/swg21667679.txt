PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The mttrapd probe is able to receive V1 traps but not V3 traps. 

SYMPTOM
Error in debug log of probe:

Error: E-UNK-000-000: SNMP Message (priority=3): /usr1/esm/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/probes/linux2x86/mttrapd.conf: line XX: Error: Unknown authentication protocol 
Error: E-UNK-000-000: SNMP Message (priority=3): net-snmp: 1 error(s) in config file(s) 


CAUSE
The authentication protocol specified in the createUser command of the mttrapd.conf file is incorrect.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the line number mentioned in the error and in this case it is against the "createUser" command that is used to specify the authentication protocol. The authentication protocol was specified in lower case instead of uppercase.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check and make sure that the authentication protocol is in upper case and not lower case. That is, it should be "MD5" and not "md5".
