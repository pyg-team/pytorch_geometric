ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title:  OutOfMemory conditions crash ITIM server
   
   Description:  BP is running with a 2gig JVM size.  They run a
   while
   (sometimes short periods of time, sometiems longer) and
   encounter
   Out-Of-Memory issue that brings down the server.
   
   From what I can tell, just basic UI activity and individual
   requests are
   involved, although the customer does have custom fesiextensions
   that
   come into play during the identity policy and workflow
   processes.
   
   Vic requested that we cut Verbose JVM Garbage collection on and
   get them
   a complete set of logs.  This is being done.
   
   Desired Behavior:  They don't want to encounter OUt-Of-Memory
   conditions.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:  Customer reproduces via normal production
   operations.  No know pattern at the moment.
   
   Environment:
   
   Server: Solaris 8 with 12GB physical RAM
   ITIM: 4.5.1-IF15
   DB2 8.1
   IDS 5.1fp2
   The WebSphere JVM heap size is set to min:0/max:2048
   Single Server setup (No Clustering at all!!!!!!)
