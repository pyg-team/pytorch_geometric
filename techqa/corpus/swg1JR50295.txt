ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Process Portal, if your user profile is configured with
   Portuguese as the language and you open a coach that has a
   combo box for which no value has been selected or entered, the
   text "<no selection>" (English text) is displayed in the combo
   box instead of its Portuguese translation.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The resource bundle for IBM Process Portal does not include a
   Portuguese translation for the text that is displayed for a
   combo box in a coach when no value has been selected or
   entered.
   
   A fix will be delivered in future maintenance releases of IBM
   BPM Version 8.0.1 and Version 8.5.5 that adds the correct
   Portuguese translation of "<no selection>".
