APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  From an in-bakset, open a locked work item in view mode, then
   close it. Now open the second unlocked work item, even though
   now Save and Complete button is enabled on work detail page,
   the second work item is actually in view only mode.
   
   This problem can be reproduced by following the steps given
   below:
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   --------------
   1. Make sure there are at least two work items (let's name two
   of them A and B) in Inbasket widget.
   2. Open a work item A.
   3. Logout of IBM Case Manager without closing Work Detail page
   so that A is locked.
   4. Login to IBM Case Manager again, try to open the locked work
   item A, click View button on the poped up warning dialog.
   5. Now the Save and NextStep button is disabled. This works as
   expected.
   6. Close this work item, it still in locked status in the
   in-basket.
   7. Now open the second work item B, which is not in locked
   status.
   8. You can see the Save and NextStep button is enabled. This
   works as expected.
   9. Enable Firebug add-on console in FireFox so you can see the
   log output there:
   10. Make data property change, click Save button, can't save.
   This works as unexpected.
    You can see in Firebug: The work item is opened for view only,
   ignore the save action.
   11. Try to complete the work item, fail again, in Firebug with
   same output:
    The work item is opened for view only, ignore the Complete
   WorkItem action.
   12. Close this work item. In in-basket, this work itemB is still
   in locked status. This is unexpected and problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Follow the steps given below to workaround this problem:
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   --
   1. Re-open workitem A, users will get prompt and users select
   'Edit' to open and close the work item. The locked icon should
   go away after that.
   2. Re-open workitem B and close it again. The locked icon should
   go away.
