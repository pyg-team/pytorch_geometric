APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An MQ classes for JMS application configures multiple
   MessageListeners for asynchronous message consumption where all
   of the associated "javax.jms.MessageConsumer"objects are created
   from the same JMS Session.
   
   The application then sets the MessageListener on one of the
   MessageConsumers to the value "null" on one thread, just ahead
   of a call to:
   
       javax.jms.Connection.stop()
   
   made by another thread on the same parent JMS Connection.  The
   call to stop() completed, but messages are still being delivered
   to one or more of the other MessageListeners.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Stop the JMS Connection before changing (including setting the
   value to null) the JMS MessageListener.  This is the more
   appropriate behaviour as per the JMS Specification which states
   that Connection.close() is the only method call that can be made
   against a MessageConsumer with a MessageListener configured.
   
   It is also encouraged that applications should be migrated away
   from using the MQ classes for JMS "migration" mode messaging,
   and use "normal" mode where possible, where the problem does not
   occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects applications who use the MQ classes for JMS
   that are configured to run in migration (v6) mode, as defined in
   the following Knowledge Center page:
   
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.
   ibm.mq.con.doc/q123670_.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.con.doc/q123670_.htm]
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The MQ classes for JMS when running in migration (also known as
   v6) mode used an internal flag to record the state of a JMS
   MQSession was before stopping asynchronous message delivery
   while changing a MessageListener.  Once the MessageListener on
   the MessageConsumer had been changed, the state flag was
   returned to its state when method call:
   
     javax.jms.Session.setMessageListener(MessageListener)
   
   was initially called.  If on another thread, the application
   also called in parallel:
   
     javax.jms.Connection.stop()
   
   in between the changing and resetting of the Session's status
   flag, the MQ classes for JMS in migration mode would have
   resumed asynchronous message consumption even though the user
   had requested that the Connection to be stopped.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ classes for JMS for migration mode have been updated to
   ensure that the operations of updating a MessageConsumer's
   MessageListener and stopping a JMS Connection have sufficient
   locking in place to prevent the problem described in this APAR
   from occurring.
