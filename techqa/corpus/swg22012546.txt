 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM StoredIQ application stack configuration UI shows garbled characters or is not displayed at all. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On the application stack VM, run the export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1 command and rerun the /siq/bin/appstackcfg command. Alternatively, the export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1 command can be included in the .profile file of any user who is permitted to run the /siq/bin/appstackcfg command.
