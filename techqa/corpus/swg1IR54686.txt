ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In eClient, sorting worklist items by attributes only updates
   the first page, other pages still show items by the order prior
   to the sort.
   For example:
   A work list contains 6 items with one attribute called "letter".
   The values are A, B, C, D, E, F for these 6 items.  For
   simplicity, I am going to call these items by the attribute
   name.  Let's say the original order they are returned is A, C,
   E, B, D, F.  Assume the display is set to have 3 items displayed
   per page.  So on page 1 we have A, C, E, and on page 2, we have
   B, D, F.  If I sort them by the attribute "letter" in ascending
   order, page 1 will display A, B, C, but page 2 will still
   display B, D, F.  The problem appears as if only the first page
   is geting updated, and the following pages all display the same
   items as before.
