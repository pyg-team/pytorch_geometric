APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deploying a BPEL module that includes a process instance
   migration specification always fails when it is deployed with
   the BPEL module it's being migrated from if both BPEL modules
   refer to the same shared library, even if there is nothing in
   the process instance migration specification because there are
   no differences between the two BPEL processes. The process
   instance migration specification does not contain errors.
   
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The BPEL process comparison component, which the Process
   Migration Specification editor uses and which is used during
   deployment, compares WSDL references by computing an ID for each
    object. This ID includes the path to the parent project that
   contains the file.  If a WSDL is in a shared library, during
   deployment this library is copied, which causes a difference to
   be reported in the migration specification and the deployment
   fails.  In Integration Designer, the migration specification
   does not report the difference because the parent project for
   the WSDL is the same for both versions of the process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM Integration Designer V8.5.5.0 that
   updates the BPEL comparison component to omit the parent project
    path for WSDL files that are referred to because it is
   irrelevant to run the process. As a result there are no false
   changes to report.
