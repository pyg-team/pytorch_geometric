 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 System SSL's SSL V2, SSL V3 and TLS protocols support the use of Triple DES ciphers and are susceptible to the Sweet32 Birthday attack vulnerability. This vulnerability affects exploiters acting as either clients or servers. Content Manager 8 Resource Manager on z/OS uses System SSL and addressed the applicable CVE. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
