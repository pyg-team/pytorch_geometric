PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using ITCAM for Transactions, and playing back a Load Runner web script on a robotic response time agent, the TEP Playback Status workspace shows playback is complete, but no data appears in TEP under robotic Application or Transaction workspace 

SYMPTOM
No ARM_xxxx.dat file is created on the RRT Robotic player agent 


CAUSE
Possible cause : 

<ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/arm/log and <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/arm/log/kt6 directories don't exist


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Make sure these 2 above directories exist on your robotic agent system.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create manually <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/arm/log and <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/arm/log/kt6 directories if they don't exist yet. 

Recycle the RRT robotic agent. 

Verify after next playback completes if you are getting ARM_xxxx.dat file created in <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/arm/log/kt6 directory
