ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a user does not have User or Privileged User role for a
   portlet application and has Administrator role for a portlets
   in the portlet application, only the delete icon is visible and
   other icons such as "wrench" ( configure portlet), "key"(assign
   access right to portlet) disappear on Manage Portlets page.
   Therefore the user cannot manage the portlets.
   
   Steps to reproduce
   1. Log in to the WP as Administrator, create a user named User1.
   2. Go to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Content root ->
   Administration, assign "User" role of this page to User1
   3. Go to Administration ->Portlet Management ->Portlets ->
   Manage Portlets, assign "User" role of this portlet to User1
   * Step1 - Step 3 (steps make User1 to be able to access and work
   on Admin page)
   4. Go to Administration -> Portlet Management -> Portlets ->
   bookmarks, assign "Administrator" of this porlet to User1
   5. Go to Administration -> Portlet Management -> Applications,
   delete the entry "All Authenticated Portal Users" from
   "Privileged User" role of the portlet application "Bookmarks".
   Then, Privilege User@PA of User1 is deleted.
   *Step 5 removes the Privileged User role from the portlet
   application.
   6. Log in to the WP as User1
   7. User1 goes to Administration -> Portlet Management ->
   Portlets -> bookmarks, icons other than "delete" are invisible.
