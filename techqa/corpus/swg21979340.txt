QUESTION
 Are there FAQs and answers about the Red Hat upgrades on my IBM PureData System for Analytics appliance? 

ANSWER
QUESTION: I upgraded to Red Hat 6.6 before April 2016. I see there is a new Red Hat 6.6 release available with Host Management 5.4.4.0. Do I need to upgrade again? 
Answer 1: 
Upgrading to Red Hat 6.6 v2 is recommended to address a network issue detected in the v1 kernel, and which is corrected in the Red Hat 6.6 v2 kernel (2.6.32-504.30.3.el6). For details on the issue discovered in Red Hat 6.6 v1, see: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1266333 [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1266333]. 
Answer 2: 
HPF 5.6 is the first level to support Red Hat 6.6 v2 with the updated DRBD kernel module. As such, HPF is a prerequisite for upgrading to RHEL 6.6 v2. To upgrade to later versions of RHEL, all N200x and N3001 models that upgraded to Red Hat 6.6 v1 must upgrade in this sequence:


 1. HPF 5.6 or later 
 2. Red Hat 6.6 v2 






QUESTION: I read that the RHEL Security Patch updates are cumulative. What does that mean for systems that are entering the program? 

Answer: Any system that is entering into the security program must first update to the release minimums [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21979254]. After that, the latest IBM PureData System for Analytics (PDA) OS Security update can be applied to bring the system to current IBM Netezza RHEL patch levels. There is no need to install preceding updates. 





QUESTION: I upgraded my system to HPF 5.6 and Red Hat 6.6 (Host Management 5.4.4.0, disc 3) per the release minimums stated. But when I tried to install the RHEL Security update from the same release (disc 7), there was an error message about DRBD incompatibility. What are my options for applying the RHEL security update? 

Answer: Systems upgraded to HPF 5.5.x or higher cannot install Host Management RHEL Security updates (disc 6 or 7). Any system running HPF 5.5.x or higher can install IBM PDA OS Security updates, which replace the Host Management updates starting in April 2016. 





QUESTION: I received a new system and performed a security scan on it. A number of vulnerabilities were identified. What are my options? 

Answer: IBM provides fixes for critical vulnerabilities [http://www-03.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/process.html] through patch updates for customers running standard, IBM Netezza factory level Red Hat releases. These patch updates are available through Host Management disk 4 (RHEL5) or disc 5 (RHEL6) on Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/Netezza+Platform&release=HOSTMGMT_5&platform=Linux&function=all&source=fc]. 

Alternatively, you may apply the latest IBM PDA OS Security update from Fix Central if your system meets the minimum release levels [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21979254]. 





QUESTION: After applying the latest IBM PDA OS Security update from Fix Central, security scans still show a number of unaddressed vulnerabilities. Why were all the vulnerabilities not addressed by the update, and what can I do about it? 

Answer: The IBM PDA OS Security update content contains the fixes and updates made available for the month of its delivery. For example, IBM PDA OS Security 2016-06 contains all content through June 30, 2016. If new or existing vulnerabilities were addressed in July 2016, the associated fixes would be provided in the IBM PDA OS Security 2016-07 update. When vulnerabilities are rated as Critical per their CSS score, it is possible to deliver the update in Host Management disk 4 (RHEL5) or disc 5 (RHEL6) on Fix Central. A Critical update could be delivered in the same month when it is identified early enough in the month to allow for proper validation. 

Any vulnerability that remains open could be an issue that Red Hat has chosen not to correct. IBM delivers security fixes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based upon the Red Hat Life Cycle and Update Policy [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata]. As set forth in its policy, fixes are not provided for all vulnerabilities on all RHEL versions, which in turn means that IBM cannot deliver security fixes for some RHEL issues.
