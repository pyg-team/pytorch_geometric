Title: IBM Validations fail against a page despite all fields succeeding in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Validations fail against a page despite all fields succeeding in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 

SYMPTOM
All fields pass validations, but Verify indicates that there is still a problem on the page. 

Example: In reviewing the batch, the page file indicates a problem status on the page but the RRS log for Validate does not show any rules failing against any field


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1.  Ensure that the page level rule calls Status_Preserve_OFF 
 2. Ensure that the page level rules do not return false 
 3.  If the problem persists, review the page file (Verify.xml), datafile (e.g. tm000001.xml) and RRS logs in order to troubleshoot the issue.


Note: this issue is separate from the batch indicating there are still problem pages to be verified. If you get a prompt that there are still problem pages within the batch, review the following IBM Technote:

In addition when using Taskmaster Web, review the [iCap] settings, specifically the DOF.
