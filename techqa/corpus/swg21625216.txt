CAUSE
The amount of data to be imported has exceeded the amount that the Controller client is capable of importing.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are several possible solutions: 

(1) Exit Controller, and re-launch the Controller client. Re-try. 

 * Sometimes this can free enough memory (on the client device) so that the import now works OK.


(2) Reduce the amount of data that you chose to export, and re-export/import 

 * In other words, re-export from your 'source'. However, this time (when asked what to export) do not tick/select/choose as much data  * In other words, re-export the data in several (smaller) chunks (i.e. not all at once).
   
   
 * Afterwords, import these smaller chunks individually.


or (3) Modify the Controller client executable (CCR.EXE) to be able to handle more memory (convert to LAA). 

 * TIP: This will only cure the problem if the client operating system is 64-bit (it will have no effect on 32-bit operating systems). 
 * For more details, see separate Technote #1579579.
