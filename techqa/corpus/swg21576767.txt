PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender (WTX) map that incorporates a xmllib or mathlib function is run, an error of "Exit call failed" is generated in non-Windows environments. 

CAUSE
The incorrect case for the xmllib or mathlib functions are used in a map rule

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When used in conjunction with the FAIL function, a map that uses these xmllib or mathlib functions will produce an "Exit call failed" or a message specified by the FAIL argument in an audit log.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
