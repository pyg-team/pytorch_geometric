Title: IBM LIM fails to start on Windows host with error OpenService(LIM) failed: Access is denied - United States

Text:
LIM, EGO, OpenService(LIM) failed: Access is denied, OpenService, Access, denied, denied 5 QUESTION/ANSWER

QUESTION
After installing Symphony on Windows host, we are unable to start EGO on the host running "egosh ego start" command. What causes this error 'OpenService(LIM) failed: Access is denied' ?

CAUSE
This error may occur due to one of the following reasons:

 1. Symphony is not installed by a OS user account that is part of the 'Administrators' group on the local host
 2. The Cluster Administrator OS user account is part of a Active Directory domain, but LIM service on the Windows host is configured to log on as a local system user instead of Cluster Administrator's.

ANSWER
The following steps shall help resolve this issue:

 1. Re-install Symphony by logging on to the Windows host using the Cluster Administrator OS user account's credentials
 2. After installation is complete, do not let the installer to automatically start Symphony on the host. Instead, edit the LIM service to log on using Cluster Administrator's OS credentials. To configure this:  * Press Windows key + R 
     * Type services.msc 
     * Scroll down to LIM service in the console window and right-click before selecting Properties 
     * Click Log on tab and select "This account "
     * Here, enter the Cluster Administrator OS user account credentials
     * Click Apply and OK 
    
    
 3. Reboot the machine before starting EGO on the Windows host
