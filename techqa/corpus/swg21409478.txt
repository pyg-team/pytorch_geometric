Title: IBM SuSE GSKIT Install Issues with permissions cause multiple problems - United States

Text:
GSKIT SUSE SLES TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Multiple type of issues related to 'Permission Denied' errors on SuSE Linux (SLES) regarding GSKIT. 

SYMPTOM
Some of the issues reported, because of this permissions problem: 

PDweb status fails: 

/opt/PolicyDirector/sbin/pdconf: error while loading shared libraries: 
libgsk7ssl.so: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied


PDMGRD will not start because it is denied access to: 

1523 open("/usr/lib/libgsk7dbfl.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied) 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Permission's on /usr/local/ibm and /usr/local/ibm/gsk7 do not get set correctly when installing with a umask of 027. The directories end up with:

r-xr-x--- (550) 

instead of the required, 

r-xr-xr-x (555) 

Work around is to change the permission's manually to 555, as the install should have done.
