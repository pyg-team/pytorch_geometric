APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a mediation flow contains a Service Invoke (SI) that is using
   Asynchronous with Callback invocation style and the server is
   restarted between the SI invoking the service and that service
   returning then the flow would not be able to carry on after the
   service returns

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of Business Process Manager Advanced v8 who use Service
   Invoke primitives in mediations with Async with Callback
   invocations.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using a Service Invoke primitive in a mediation that uses
   the Async with Callback invocation style the flow will create a
   new Event flow to handle the response from the Service Invoke.
   If the parent flow of this Event flow is an example of a
   FaultFlow and this is not still in memory, such as would happen
   if the server was restarted after the Service Invoke has sent
   the request, then the Event flow would not be created and the
   response could not be handled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the response can be handled for
   Fault flows even after a server restart.
