   ****************************************************************
   During XEIIN/XEIOUT processing the CIUXCCO1 exit program gets
   control. After execution of the TRT instruction
   (offset X'D8') register 2 contains an incorrect value when
   INQUIRE WORKREQUEST(X'B802') or SET WORKREQUEST(X'B804') CICS
   command is processed.  Later a CLC instruction at offset X'F2'
   causes an abend (code 0C4/AKEA) because of incorrect address of
   the first operand evaluated based on register 2.
   The Translate table (TRT_TAB) in the CIUXCCOD copy needs to be
   corrected (offset  X'B8').
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Translate table (TRT_TAB) in the CIUXCCOD copy has been
   corrected at offset  X'000000B8' to avoid an abend (code
   0C4/AKEA) in the CIUXCCO1 exit program.
