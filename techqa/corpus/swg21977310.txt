The next error is then listed during shutdown of the P8 connector.0x426 - The service has not been started


CAUSE
The Content Process Engine is only checking for JNP (Java Naming Provider) responses, not HTTPS responses.


The issue occurs due to the Content Process Engine, responding to JNP but not HTTPS requests. JNP is the protocol listening port for the Naming Service for java applications that communicate with jBOSS Application Content Process Engines. 

The main difference between JNP and the HTTP protocol is that HTTP traverses firewalls.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The P8 Connector service shuts down, thereby preventing the archiving of mails from ICC to the P8 repository.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restarting Content Process Engine on the P8 server should resolve the issue.
