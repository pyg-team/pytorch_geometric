APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - IBM Rational Rose RealTime 2003.06.15
    - All operating systems
   Reproducible: Y
   Problem description:
   The new feature to use regular expressions ("&" and "|") in
   search does not work. The
   result from the search depends on which order the words are
   typed in the field and the
   search also reports incorrect results.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using & and | (regular expression search) may not
   produce expect
   ed results and depends upon order in which
   words are used in the
    search.
   For Example: Right click on the Top most model elemen
   t
   "Model" and select Find In... from the context menu and
   perfor
   m the following search on the model. Search string
   Returned tran
   sitions computer & system Initial, t2
   (WRONG), system & computer
    t2 (CORRECT), or
   Open the code editor for a transition
   Right
    click to open the context menu
   Select Search --> Find
   Check t
   he Regular expression check box (in the Find dialog)
   and type "s
   ystem & computer"
   Click button Mark All
   An error message appear
   s indicating nothing is found.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, with the fix for this issue:
   If the Search String contains any regular expression, Rose
   RealTime will ignore the space(s) around the logical
   operator(s).
   Search String using & will report on the intersection of
   two sets of strings.
   Search String using | will calculate the union of two sets
   of strings.
   When a Search String contains both operators | and &,
   Rose RealTime will calculate the union and perform
   intersection operations as it encounters the operator while
   scanning the pattern searched for, starting from the
   left-most character.
   Refer to the list below, which includes Search String
   examples and expected results.
   xyz & abc - Searches for occurrences of both strings xyz
   and abc.
   x y z & abc - Searches for occurrences of both string x
   y z and abc.
   xyz | abc - Searches for occurrences of xyz, abc and if any
   of the strings are present, include the string in the
   results.
   xyz | abc & def - Calculates the intersection of the
   results of searching xyz, ab". Using the previous result
   set, again calculates the union with the results found while
   searching for "def".
   xyz & abc & def - Calculates intersection of the
   results while searching for xyz, abc. Using the previous
   result set, again calculates the intersection with the
   results found while searching for "def".
