 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer is experiencing a problem. 

What information / data / logs can the customer collect in order to send to IBM Support to help them disagnose the root cause of the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are many different places that contain useful information. The two most important ones are as follows:

(1) Print screen(s) of error messages 

 * 


(2) Windows Event Viewer (Application Log and System Log)  * 
 * client 
 * 
 * application server
 * 
 *  For more details, see separate IBM Technote #1371409. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Logon to the Controller application server (as a Windows administrator) 
   2. Click "Start - Run" 
   3. Type the following: EVENTVWR 
   4. Click "Enter" 
   5. Right-click on " Application" log 
   6. Choose to "Save All Events As" 
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21588600&amp;aid=1] 
   7. Choose to save as the format *.EVTX 
   8. Compress this file (for example to a 'ZIP' or '7z' format)  *  Example filename: appserver_application.zip 
   
   
   9. Right-click on " System" log 
   10. Choose to "Save All Events As" 
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21588600&amp;aid=2] 
   11. Choose to save as the format *.EVTX 
   12. Compress this file (for example to a 'ZIP' or '7z' format)  * Example filename: appserver_system.zip
   
   
   13. Sometimes it is useful to get the 'application log' from the client device too.  * Therefore you can repeat steps 2-8 on the client device (typically the Citrix server, or the end user's PC/laptop).
   
   
   14. Send the compressed files to IBM Cognos support. 


====================================================== 
The above two types of information should be sufficient to solve most problems. However, in more advanced/obscure issues, there are other logs that can be useful: 
====================================================== 

(3) Microsoft SQL Server logs 
If using Microsoft SQL, then there are logs created inside a path similar to the following:  * 
 * TIP: For more information, see Microsoft article "Viewing the SQL Server Error Log"


(4) Consolidation log - " logvfp . log " 
If the problem relates to when a user runs a consolidation, then it can be useful to read the information inside the "logvfp.log"  * This is automatically created on the application server, inside a temporary folder which relates to the environment. For example, it will probably be inside here: 

C:\Windows\Temp\CognosController\<database_type><database_server_name><database_connection_name>\<controller_user_name>  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1373203.


(5) FAP (and TM1) logs 
If the problem relates to when a user publishes data to TM1 (via "FAP"), then it can be useful to read the information inside the FAP and TM1 log files.  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1591056.


(6) BI-related errors (for example errors when running Standard Reports) 
If the problem relates to the Report Server (Cognos BI engine) then it can be useful to enable RSVP / AAA logs (RSVP_Audit.log, RSVP_Perf.log and AAAclient.log).  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1587003.


(7) BI-related errors (for example CAM errors when logging in, or disconnections/timeouts when already logged in) 
cogserver.log - typical location: 
C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64\logs 
ccr.log - typical location: 
C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64\log 

(8) Advanced issues only - enable Web Services advanced logging 
If the problem is extremely advanced/complex, then it is *possible* that creating/reading "ControllerWebServiceTrace.log" files will be useful.  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1374632


(9) Miscellaneous information - useful for INTERMITTENT issues 
For intermittent issues, it is useful to ask the users (who experience the issues) to note the date and time points when the problems (e.g. disconnections or errors) happen. Wherever possible, please ask them to capture and store a screen print.  * TIP: An Excel spreadsheet is an ideal way to store this type of user created log.


By capturing this information, IBM Support will be able to correlate the end user's symptoms with messages recorded inside the log files. 

(10) Excel link log (for Controller 10.2.1 onwards) 
Change the 'log4net' configuration file so that the 'logging level' is increased (from "ERROR" to "DEBUG").  * For more details, see separate IBM Technote #1959443.


(11) Controller Web log (for Controller 10.3.0 onwards) 
This is the file 'console.log'.  * TIP: By default, this is located here: C:\Program Files\ibm\cognos\ccr_64\fcmweb\wlp\usr\servers\fcm.web\logs


(12) Microsoft WER crash dump files 
It is sometimes useful to connect Microsoft WER crash dump files (typically from the client device).  * TIP: For details, see separate IBM Technote #2012538.
