APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A data-source with multiple data-source connections i s created
   that is then used by Framework Manager to create a DQM model (or
   run metadata wizard against an existing DQM model using this
   datapsource)
   
   The following error is presented.
   
   BMT-IMP-0002 Failed to execute metadata request.
   ambiguousDataSourceCredentials.
   
   Setting Disable this entry on all connections except one
   produces the issue. This issue is not reproducible in CQM.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove multiple data-source connections within the data-source
   
   
   Or create a 2nd sign-on to your connection so you'll be asked
   then for your connection and then for the sign-on. This sign-on
   could be a dummy and must not have valid credentials. Finally
   ensure the correct one is chosen by your users.
   This must be done for all data sources having multiple
   connections per connection.
