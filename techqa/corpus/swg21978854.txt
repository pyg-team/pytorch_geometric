Title: IBM Retrieve of On Demand object fails with ANS1088E RC124 - United States

filespace RC=124 ARCHIVE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrade of CMOD to 9.5.0.4, some object retrievals fail with ANS1088E (RC124) File space '*' does not exist. 

CAUSE
There was an issue in Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) version 9.5.0.4 that affected data store on the Tivoli Storage Manager Server, resulting in a problem to access the historical data and for the newly loaded data to be named incorrectly. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A Tivoli Storage Manager API service trace during the retrieval shows all objects that failed to be retrieved belonged to filespaces with a prepending "/ARCHIVE", e.g. /ARCHIVE/TST. All objects that were successfully retrieved did not have the /ARCHIVE prepend. This is due to a naming issue specific to CMOD 9.5.0.4 with the default instance name, which has since been resolved. Reference the CMOD technote on this topic, which includes a link and further information on the fixed CMOD packages:
