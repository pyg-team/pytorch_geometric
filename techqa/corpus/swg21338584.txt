Title: IBM Creating a multiple file cube: TR1901 PowerPlay DataServer can't read the PowerCube <bitmap> - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to build a large cube in PowerPlay Transformer, the following error is returned: 

> TR1901 PowerPlay DataServer can't read the PowerCube in path\cube.mdc 
On examination of the partially created mdc file, the file size is 2GB.



CAUSE
This error can be caused by hitting the file size limit of 2GB set by 32-bit applications. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


To avoid this error, a multiple file cube can be built by Transformer. Locate the following line in the trnsfrmr.ini file and modify the default setting of zero (disabled).

MultiFileCubeThreshold=0

To best employ this functionality, you should first know how many consolidated records are being read into the cube. Dividing this number by two or three, is a good point of reference as to what the setting for MultiFileCubeThreshold should be.

The following is from the Transformer online help:

Transformer determines the number of output files needed, taking the number of data records in the cube, dividing by the threshold, and rounding up. Cube partitions are spread evenly across these multidimensional partition (.mdp) files, and an additional multidimensional cube (.mdc) file is added to hold the PowerCube metadata.
