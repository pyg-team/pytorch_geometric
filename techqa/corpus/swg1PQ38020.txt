APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer gets 500 Internal Server Error on his browser when
   he runs a servlet that uses the callPage method to retrieve
   .html files. Retrieving jsp ( .jsp ) files from a servlet
   using callPage() works successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the .html suffix to .jhtml in the invocation of the
   callpage method in the servlet and change the name of the file
   from *.html to *.jhtml.

   ****************************************************************
   When a Servlet used the callpage method to serve static html
   pages to the browser, the WebSphere Application Server could not
   serve the html pages for two reasons. One, the WebSphere
   Application Server could not find the html pages, and two the
   WebSphere Application Server could not resolve its actions for
   handling *.html.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Instructions on how to enable the WebSphere Application Server
   to find the html pages and resolve the actions for handling
   *.html have been added to the "Application Server Planning,
   Installing, and Using" book for the WebSphere Application
   Server 1.2.
   
   1. Add the following line in  Partial Table of Contents of
      Chapter 3
       Adding html file types to the Application Server
   
   after
    Adding JHTML files and JavaServer Pages(JSPs) to the
    Application Server
   
   
   2. Add the following section  in  Chapter 3
    Adding html files to the Application Server
   To enable the Application Server to serve html files
   from a servlet as pages using the callPage method,
   the following two configuration changes are needed.
   
      1. Add a Pass directive to the Web Server's
         httpd.conf configuration file to specify the
         template for serving the html files. For
         example:
   
             PASS /myhtml/*  /u/john/mystuff/*
   
         A sample callPage invocation that would match this
        PASS rule is:
          ((com.sun.server.http.HttpServiceResponse)
            res).callPage("/myhtml/callpagehtml.html", req)
        where req is the request object and res is response
        object.
   
      2. Add the property urltype.jsp=*.html to
         the was.conf file, where *.html is a string
         that identifies the URL template that should
         be processed similarly to JSP or jhtml files.
         This property indicates to the Application
         Server that these files should be processed
         the same way as JSP files or jhtml files
         are processed.
   
   after the section
      Adding JHTML files and JavaServer Pages(JSPs) to
      the Application  Server
