APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When testing the size of input parameters to a custom function
   in ITX, it may be observed that the length is double the
   expected length if the item being passed in is a string literal.
   
   Example, the following two rules where the object 'Input1'
   contains "HelloWorld" the same result is expected.
   
   =MyLib->SomeFunction("HelloWorld")
   =MyLib->SomeFunction(Input1)
   
   Instead the following result is seen:
   
   20,HelloWorld   <- the length being incorrectly displayed X2
   10,HelloWorld
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXRTC - 60179
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: The size could be passed in as an additional
   parameter, but this brings additional overhead.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender customers who use TX external
   functions
   
   Problem Description:
   When using TX external map functions, some parameters may not
   have the correct lengths.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed issue in CallExternalFuncProc to adjust the lengths after
   being converted to native.
