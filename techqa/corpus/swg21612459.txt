Title: IBM Tivoli Netcool/Impact: Hibernate function example corrected, RemoveHibernation function added - United States

Text:
Netcool/Impact; Hibernate function; RemoveHibernation; Timeout; TimeOut TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The example in the information center for the Hibernate function does not mention the RemoveHibernation function. There is also a typo in the example, where 'Timeout' should read 'TimeOut'. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Hibernate function example requires the following updates: 

The example for the Hibernate function previously was:

The following example shows how to cause a policy to hibernate for one minute.
// Call Hibernate and pass an action key and the number of seconds
// to hibernate as input parameters
ActionKey = "ActionKey" + GetDate();
TimeOut = 60;
Hibernate(ActionKey, NULL, Timeout);

The updated version includes the RemoveHibernation function in the example and corrects the typo: 

The following example shows how to cause a policy to hibernate for one minute.
// Call Hibernate and pass an action key and the number of seconds
// to hibernate as input parameters
ActionKey = "ActionKey" + GetDate();
Timeout = 60;
Hibernate(ActionKey, null, Timeout);
RemoveHibernation(ActionKey);
