QUESTION
How is the mail.averagedelivertime statistic computed?

ANSWER
 

To calculate the delivery time, we take the time that the message was first dropped in the mail.box of the first server and subtract that from the delivered date time (DeliveredDate). This yields the gross amount of seconds it took. We then check the RouteTimes field and sum all the differences between each timepair in this field. This value is subtracted from the gross amount of seconds; hence we filter out the time the message stayed in the mail.box for each server. This gives us the net time the message spent in routing.

This net time is added to the other net times we gathered (we do this for each delivered message) and increment the counter for the number of delivered messages. These two values are then used to calculate the average delivery 
time per message.

NOTE: The accuracy of this statistic is highly dependent on whether the servers are in sync with respect to time. Also, if the servers are in different timezones, you could hit differences in, for example, DST, which would yield incorrect results in the first steps described above (there is no way to check whether, for example, DST is actually enabled on a server or that the start and end dates for DST are modified.)

Also note that it is not possible to limit the collection of this statistic to a predefined domain.
