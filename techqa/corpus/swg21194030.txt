Text:
NETVCMD CMDSERV TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When issuing batch commands to netview using the NETVCMD, customer receives:
"NETVCMD waiting for response from NetView " in the job log. Customer requested assistance to resolve this problem. 

CAUSE
Corresponding CMDSERV command not issued from NetView.

ANSWER
NETVCMD is a NetView supplied sample and can be found in CNMS8029 in NetView's CNMSAMP. 

Batch invocation of this sample is via JCL modelled from any that invokes IRXJCL 

When the NetView command is issued, server_name must be the same as specified in the 
CMDSERV NAME=server_PPI_name command that was issued from NetView : 

- To issue the command from TSO or from a batch job, enter: 
NETVCMD SERVER=server_name LIST DEFAULTS 

- To issue the command from UNIX, enter: 
NETVCMD -Sserver_name LIST DEFAULTS 

Example: 
Using the Default Server Name: You do not have to specify a server name if you want to use the default DSICMDSV. The syntax of the command is the same from both TSO and UNIX: 
NETVCMD LIST DEFAULTS 

From the details in the NetView command reference manual you need to issue the NetView command CMDSERV AUTHSNDR=Y,NAME=DSICMDSV from the NetView command line (AUTHSNDR=Y if you want things to be APF authorized first) and this will setup the DSICMDSV id and register it to the PPI. You then will be able to issue the NETVCMD from TSO. If you want this permanently setup then create a auxinitcmd in CNMSTYLE to issue this CMDSERV each time NetView is started up, or devise another method to have the command submitted when NetView starts. 

Next, ensure that the server name (eg. DSICMDSV) is registered to the PPI handle the connection between NetView and TSO. Issue a DISPPI from NetView to confirm the connection is defined.
