APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For a solution that contains multiple case types and multiple
   roles, where users who belong to these roles have access to only
   some of the case types, the following issues might occur:
   - When creating a case, a user might see some case types in an
   option list that are not enabled for their current role.
   However, the user cannot create cases for the case types they
   are not configured for.
   - When creating a case, a user might not see some case types in
   an option list that are enabled for their current role. As a
   result, the user might be unable to create the desired cases.
   - When searching for case instances, a user might see some
   search properties in an option list that are not enabled for
   their current role. However, the user will not retrieve any
   results for the search properties they are not enabled to
   access.
   - When searching for case instances, a user might not see some
   search properties in an option list that are enabled for their
   current role. As a result, the user might not be able to
   retrieve results for the desired search.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1) Create a solution with the following
   - 4 properties, prop1,2,3,4
   - 2 roles, role1 and role2
   - 2 caseTypes, ct1 and ct2
   - Associate prop1 and prop2 with ct1, and make both available in
   Search
   - Associate prop3 and prop4 with ct2, and make both available in
   Search
   2) Deploy the solution
   3) Run the security wizard
   - for ct1, give role1 - create, view, and update
   - for ct2, give role2 - create, view, and update
   - do not give any permissions to 'All Case Types' for any roles
   - for role1, associate a non-admin user, ex. user1
   - for role2, associate a non-admin user, ex. user2
   4) After all of the changes have been applied, login as user1
   5) user1 on the Cases page, should be able to create ct1, and in
   the search drop down, should see prop1 and prop2
   6) Log off user1, and close the browser
   7) login as user2, and go to the Cases page
   8) instead of being able to create ct2, the 'Add Cases' button
   is disabled, and the search drop down only shows prop1 and prop2
   
   This behavior depends on who logs into Case Client to access the
   Solution after the ICM server has been started.
   To reverse the behavior, restart the ICM server, and login as
   user2 first.
   Then user2 will see the Add Case button, and can create ct2, and
   the search drop downs will have prop3 and prop4
   logoff user2, close browser, and login as user1.  User1 will not
   be able to add a case, and the drop down for search will have
   prop3 and prop4.
