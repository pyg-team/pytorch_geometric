IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Fix Pack 2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FDatacap+Taskmaster+Capture&fixids=9.0.1.2-Datacap-WIN-FP002&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  n order to let the panel persists fields (property) from the
   main page while displaying the trailing page.  The customer set
   the IPS to have the status of 0.
   Once the batch arrives at the Verify task, the document/pages
   all have STATUS = 0.
   Click on the Main Page, the viewer panel would show the image
   and the Field Details properly.  However, when you click on the
   Trailing Page, the viewer panel DOES NOT show the image of the
   training page.
   
   NOTE:  In 9.0.1, when clicking on the trailing page, the viewer
   panel DOES show the image of the trailing page, AND the Field
   Details persists.  This is what the customer wants.
   Environment:
   9.0.1 FP1
   Actions Taken/Things Tried:
   Steps to reproduce the issue.
   1) Configure the IPS of Verify task to have 128,75,0
   2) VScan page APT7, APT8 and APT9
   3) Run it through Profiler.
   4) Before Verify this batch.  Modify the Verify.xml so that both
   pages (TM0000002 and TM000003) both have the status of 0.  (This
   is simulating the customer's logic of calling setDCOStatus(0))
   5) Verify the batch, you will see that viewer panel does not
   display the trailing page when clicking on it.
   'With 9.0.1, the viewer panel would display the trailing page
   AND persists the field details panel (middle).
