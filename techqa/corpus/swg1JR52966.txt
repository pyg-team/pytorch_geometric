   cluster members to your existing IBM Business Process Manager
   (BPM) deployment environment, you get an error similar to the
   following error:

   failed:/IBM/BPM8.5/profiles/DmgrProfile/wstemp/anonymous14241825

   ****************************************************************
   When the deployment environment was created, the 100Custom.xml
   files on the application cluster level for Process Server, and
   on the support cluster level for Performance-data-warehouse
   were not included. These files are used as templates when
   adding new cluster members. Therefore,you receive a
   FileNotFoundException when they are missing during cluster
   member configuration.
   Also, the substitution variables ~SERVER_DESCRIPTION~ (in
   99Local.xml), ~APPSERVER_CELL~ (in 50AppServer.xml), and
   ~TWPERFSERVER_AUTO_SCHEMA_MGMT~ (in 00Static.xml) are not
   resolved correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V.8.5.0.1 that updates the
   BPMConfig command to add the missing 100Custom.xml files and
   substitute the unresolved variables.
