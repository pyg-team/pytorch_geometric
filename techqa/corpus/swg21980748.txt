QUESTION
 How to change "Select from top 1000" to another value 

ANSWER
The default value can be changed by adding the property: 

 * 
 * 


into the properties file: 

 * 


in the format: 

 * 


where [n] is the desired integer - for example: 

 * 


In this example the OMNIbusEventReader query pull up to 2000 events instead of the default 
1000. This requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. 

NB: The setting of this value must take into consideration the polling rate of the OMNIbusEventReader. The default is 3000 milliseconds.
