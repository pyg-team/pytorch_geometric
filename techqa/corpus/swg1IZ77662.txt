ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Products: Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 FP1 and ITM Agent for Netcool
   
   OMNIbus 7.3
   OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise (x64)
   
   On trying to installing the TEPS Support for the Tivoli Netcool
   OMNIbus Objectserver Agent it is not possible to enable the
   Checkbox
   for the TEPS Support. On clicking this box we get a popup with
   the
   message:
   "Please install the following prerequisites: IBM DB2 Universal
   Database 8.1 or higher, installed with local user ID with
   administrator rights, or - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or higher".
   After
   acknowledging this PopUp, the checkbox is unchecked again.
   
   This message doesn't make sense as we use our TEPS with the
   Internal
   Derby Database.
   
   L2 engineer replicated issue:
   
   Have gone through the install of OMNIbus Objectserver Agent on
   ITM 6.22
   F01 with a derby database.
   When I get to the screen to choose features you want to install
   
   
   when I try to select the box by the TEPS I get the pop -up
   window
    "Please install the following prerequisites: IBM DB2 Universal
   Database 8.1 or higher, installed with local user ID with
   administrator rights, or - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or higher"
   
   Just as explained by the user.
   
   
   Have just started going through the screens again and I notice
   on first
   screen of wizard installer with the welcome banner
   
   it states installed: IBM Tivoli Monitoring  TMV621
               CD: Tivoli OmnibusServer Agent - TMV621
   
   However my machine is ITM 6.22 FP01
   
   It looks like it does not take into account a Derby database.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This problem is larger than the OMNIbus scope, as it
   
   will occur for any agent with a 6.2.1 or earlier install base,
   being
   installed into 6.2.2 environment using Derby.  This includes
   agents
   shipped by ITM itself, such as the NT or Linux OS agents, if
   they
   are based on the 6.2.1 or earlier installer.
   
   
   
   As the installation message states, DB2 or MSSQL is a
   prerequisite.  Note that Derby is not supported for historical
   data.
   
   
   A new PMR should be raised with ITM support to resolve the
   underlying
   issue of installing 6.2.1 based agents in a 6.2.2 environment
   with
   Derby.
