APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the InfoCenter, for BPM 8.5, the referenced link for "tuning
   properties" for Oracle database privileges for Messaging Engine
   database is incorrect:
   
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.
   wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rpln_db_privileges.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rpln_db_privileges.html]
   
   There is a section that states the following:
   
   Tip: Messaging Engines use the TRUNCATE TABLE SQL statement,
   which might require the DROP ANY TABLE privilege. See Database
   privileges. If you prefer not to give the user this privilege,
   you can avoid it, at a performance cost, by using tuning. See
   Setting tuning properties.
   
   But the link for the tuning properties is incorrect. It should
   point to the following link:
   
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.web [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.web]
   sphere.n
   d.multiplatform.doc/ae/rjm0650_.html
   
   Please refer to the above InfoCenter link
   where at the very bottom of the page there is a note that states
   the
   following:
   "If you do not grant TRUNCATE TABLE authority to the database
   user ID,
   you can force the messaging engine to delete rows individually
   instead
   of
   truncating the table. To force the messaging engine to delete
   rows
   individually,
   set
   sib.msgstore.jdbcUseDeleteInsteadOfTruncateAtStartup to true as
   a custom
   property of the messaging engine.
   Note: If you use DELETE instead of TRUNCATE, startup is slower
   when
   there are many non-persistent messages in the datastore."
