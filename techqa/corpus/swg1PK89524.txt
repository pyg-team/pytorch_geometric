ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Websphere version 6.0.2, when you define a cluster and add
   an already defined server to it, the server scope resources are
   promoted from the server level to the cluster level. When a
   console user tries to create a queue connection factory using
   the default JMS provider at the cluster member level, an
   HTTP 500 error is shown in the browser with the following NPE:
   
   java.lang.NullPointerException
   at com.ibm.ws.console.core.action.GenericAction.makeChild(Gener
   icAction.java:366)
   at com.ibm.ws.console.resources.jms.mqseries.MQQueueConnectionF
   actoryDetailAction.execute(MQQueueConnectionFactoryDetailActio
   n.java:180)
   at org.apache.struts.action.RequestProcessor.processActionPerfo
   rm(RequestProcessor.java:484)
   at org.apache.struts.action.RequestProcessor.process(RequestPro
   cessor.java:275)
   ...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define the resource at the node, cell or cluster scope.
   If the resource has to be defined at the cluster member scope,
   you can use wsadmin.sh createCluster and createClusterMember
   commands and choose an option to retain, move or copy the server
   resources.  This can be done at service level 6.0.2.35 or above
   (where PK67315 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK67315] was shipped).

   ****************************************************************
   The HTTP 500 Error will no longer appear on version 6.1 and
   future releases of Websphere Application Server.
   The console panels have been changed to provide a list of
   available providers.  Trying to view this list of providers
   cannot result in the above error.
   
   If customers want to create server (cluster member) level JMS
   resouces on version 6.0.1, they will need to use the
   resoucesScope option provided with PK67315 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK67315].  Please see
   PK67315 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK67315] for more details.
