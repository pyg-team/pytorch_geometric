Java Client Java Client  The Java client is not restricted to running on the reference platforms; it can also run on any platform where a suitable Java runtime is available. The IBM service team may request that a problem be reproduced on a reference platform. The client can be run on the following Java runtimes: 

 *   JSE 1.5 or above that is "Java Compatible". 
   
   
 *   In addition to running in a basic JRE the client is packaged as an OSGi bundle and can be run in an OSGi runtime compliant with the OSGi R4 core framework specification
