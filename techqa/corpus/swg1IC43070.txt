ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The tsm administrator guide for AIX, HP-UX, LINUX  documents
   in chapter 9, section "Defining a Copy Storage Pool", Table
   22, for the "Reclamation threshold": ".. Reclamation is a
   process that moves any remaining active, fragmented files
   from one volume to another volume, thus making the original
   volume available for reuse. .. When a copy storage pool
   volume that is offsite becomes eligible for reclamation, the
   reclamation process attempts to retrieve the active files on
   the reclaimable volume from a primary or copy storage pool
   volume that is onsite. .."
   This must be corrected since also inactive files will be
   processed by reclamation. However how reclamation works
   should not be explained in this table.
   Instead The entry should read:
   "Specifies when to initiate reclamation of volumes in the
   copy storage pool. Reclamation is a process that moves any
   remaining files from one volume to another volume, thus
   making the original volume available for reuse. A volume is
   eligible for reclamation when the percentage of unused space
   on the volume is greater than the reclaim parameter value.
   Reclamation processing works differently for offsite storage
   pool volumes and virtual volumes. When a copy storage pool
   volume that is offsite becomes eligible for reclamation, the
   reclamation process attempts to retrieve the files on the
   reclaimable volume from a primary or copy storage pool
   volume that is onsite. The process then writes these files
   to an available volume in the original copy storage pool.
   See Reclamation for Copy Storage Pools and Reclamation of
   Volumes with the Device Type of SERVER for more details.

   In the administrator guide for windows, the table is in
   chapter 10, same section, table number is '23'.
