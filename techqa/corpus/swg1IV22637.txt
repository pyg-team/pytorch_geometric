ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle database will core dump if the

   Workaround:
   Option-1. Grant the read+execute file(tnsping) permission to the
   agent OS user

   Option-3. Disable the Listener monitoring by setting the
   envionment
   variable of KRZ_LISTENER_PING_INTERVAL=0.
