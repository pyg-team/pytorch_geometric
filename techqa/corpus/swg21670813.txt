Title: IBM The profile for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard is incorrect when you migrate the same version to new hardware - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You attempt to migrate your IBM Business Process Manager Standard profile to new hardware without changing the product version. You follow the information in the "Migrating to the same version on new hardware" topic within the IBM Business Process Manager product documentation. However, the profile that is created on the target hardware uses the incorrect profile template. 

SYMPTOM
In the BPMCreateTargetProfile log file, you can see that it invoked the manageprofiles command with the -templatePath BPM_root/profileTemplates/default parameter to create the target profile.


CAUSE
The Migrating to the same version on new hardware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/cmig_newhw.html] topic in the IBM Business Process Manager product documentation is used for IBM Business Process Manager Advanced profile migration. The topic does not apply to IBM Business Process Manager Standard profile migration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow the Migrating to IBM BPM V8.0.1 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/upgrade/topic/upgrading_to_8011.html] topic in the IBM Business Process Manager product documentation to migrate your IBM Business Process Manager Standard profile from your original hardware to new hardware.This topic exists in the "Migrating from IBM Business Process Manager Standard V7.5.x, Teamworks 7, or WebSphere Lombardi Edition" section of the product documentation. When you follow the steps in this topic, ignore the step on upgrading existing databases because updating the old existing databases is not needed. 

However, you need to delete all of the SIB-related tables in the Process Server database and the Performance Data Warehouse databases. New SIB tables are automatically recreated when you start the new created servers. The reason for recreating the SIB tables is because the Messaging Engine UUID is changed after you create the new target profile. 

To find the SIB tables, refer to the Data store tables [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rjm0640_.html] topic in the WebSphere Application Server product documentation.
