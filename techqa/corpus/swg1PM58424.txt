ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   Adding an element to the SysML model makes it to crash
   
   
   Description:
   When customer tries to add a Value Type/Block, Rhapsody crashes.
   
   More Info obtained from the customer:
   
   1) Is the crash reproduceable always?
   ?? It depends. At certain days, Rhapsody crashes every time you
   try to add a new block. On the other day, it works perfectly.
   
   2) Is this project specific? If Yes, can you please share the
   model with us?
   ?? I am not sure. I have noticed this kind of behavior in a few
   different model.
   
   
   3) Can you give a video recording Or the exact steps to
   reproduce in a simple sample model?
   ?? Attached with the CR.
   
   
   4) Steps to Reproduce
   ?? It won't happen every day. But if it happens, it is very easy
   to reproduce.
    a) Work with SysML model
   
    b) Right click a package in the model tree
   
    c) Choose Add New -? Blocks -? PrimitiveOperation (or
   ValueType)
    After that the following will happen:
   
    I) At the bottom of Rhapsody window green 'save' bar starts to
   extend
    II) Message box appear. You could choose Send Error Message or
   Cancel
    III) If you press nothing and wait a few seconds, the block
   appears in the model tree
    Unfortunately the message box prevents you to continue to work.
   If you click Cancel, Rhapsody shut down. If you click Send
   Message, you could send a message and after that you have to
   shut down Rhapsody
   
   
   
   5) Is the model under CM? If yes, the CM tool details please.
   
   ?? No. I am not using any.
   
   
   6) Please share all the contents of the RER folder which can be
   found in your Rhp Installation Dir
   ?? Attached with this CR.
   
   
   7) Is there any pattern you observe for this random crash
   behaviour?
   ?? I think that it become more common if you have more stuff in
   the model. Because I know this behaviour, I try to avoid it. For
   example, I have a package for Flow Specifications. Yesterday, I
   managed to add new specifications in it by right click. Today, I
   couldn't do it anymore, so I created Block Definition Diagram.
   Now I select a Flow Specification symbol from toolbar and add
   new specifications into that diagram. After creation, I delete
   the block from bdd but not from model tree. I would say that
   this behavior is pretty common if I don't try to avoid it.
   
   
   
   8) Has this been tested with any other version/machine? If Yes,
   the results please....
   ?? No. Just in my laptop.
   
   
   
   9) It looks more like the system is running out of system
   resources in this case...Can the CPU utilization be tracked?
   
   ?? I don't think so. I have Intel Core i5 M560 processor, 4GB
   ram (in 32 bit system only 3GB is used). While using Rhapsody, I
   can't see any big changes in Performance tab (Task Manager)
   
   
   
   Support Analysis:
   Unable to reproduce the crash behaviour at support. However,
   probed the customer for all relevant info which has been given
   above.
   RER logs are also attached.
   
   
   
   Attachments:
   32888,999,866.zip contains the video recording, RER logs and the
   model customer has sent.
