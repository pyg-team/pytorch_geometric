APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  User Affected:
   
   WebSphere MQ monitoring Agent version 7.1.0 TCR report Users
   
   Environment:
   WebSphere MQ monitoring Agent V7.1.0 - Tivoli Common Reporting
   (TCR).
   
   Problem Description:
   The schema name of ITMUSER is hardcoded in the data model for MQ
   monitoring Agent TCR report. This causes reports fail when using
   a
   non-default schema name in DB tables.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Temporary Workaround:
   
   If the table schema that customer uses is not ITMUser, use the
   framework
   manager to update the schema to what customer used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description - The schema name of ITMUSER is hardcoded
   for the IBM Tivoli Monitoring tables in the data model for the
   MQ Agents. This causes reports to fail when using a different
   schema name while configuring the Warehouse Proxy Agent and the
   Summarization and Pruning Agent.
   Recommendation - Apply fix WebSphereMQReports_V7.1_IV56009 and
   WebSphereBrokerReports_V7.1_IV56009
   Comments - Interim Fix WebSphereMQReports_V7.1_IV56009 and
   WebSphereBrokerReports_V7.1_IV56009 resolve the problem by
   allowing for a different schema name.
   Circumvention -
   Temporary Fix - WebSphereMQReports_V7.1_IV56009
                   WebSphereBrokerReports_V7.1_IV56009
