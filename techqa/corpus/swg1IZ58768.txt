APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When "Append Policy Name to Log File Name" option is checked,
   within the policylogger Service, the Activate() appears to not
   be working, based on the policylogger log output. Despite this
   the function does indeed work as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One can disable the "Append Policy Name to Log File Name"
   option, with the policylogger Service, and it'll show the
   Activate() function to be working as expected within the main
   policylogger log file and/or GUI window.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WHEN "APPEND POLICY NAME TO LOG FILE NAME" OPTION IS CHECKED
   THE ACTIVATE()  APPEARS TO NOT BE WORKING BASED ON THE LOG
   OUTPUT
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  fixed in 4.0.2.1-TIV-NCI-IF0006
