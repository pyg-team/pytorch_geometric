QUESTION
 DD outputs R0000nnn are filling up the spool file in the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS joblog. 

CAUSE
DD outputs R0000nnn (where nnn is a number) are Connect:Direct trace files. How can I determine what set the trace and turn it off so the spool file does not use too much space?

ANSWER
Traces can be set in three ways:

1) DEBUG= is set in the Init Parms. This causes all nodes to be traced. Normally this method is not used because of the potential for huge trace outputs.
2) Traces can be set for individual nodes using IUI or Connect:Direct commands. This will only trace the nodes that are selected.
3) Traces can also be set at the process level so that when a process runs, trace is enabled and then disabled when it is finished. It can be difficult to determine which processes are setting this type of trace.

Here is how to check where the trace was enabled:

In the IUI, enter ADMIN;INQ;IDBG. This shows the DEBUG setting along with each entry in the node table. If the DEBUG setting is something like a typical trace of 8C00006E, you should check to see what is coded in the Init Parms. Note that a setting of 00200000 is not a trace setting, so that is not causing the trace output.

If the DEBUG setting displayed is different from the Init Parm, then a user has changed the value dynamically only for the duration of the started task.

If a node shows traces enabled, review if that is still necessary. You can go into the ADMIN;MD screen to turn it off as needed. If you want to determine which user set traces on, look for messages STRA047I or STRA048I.

If no traces are enabled and you still see increasing trace output, then you may have a process with DEBUG= coded inside. The only way to find that is to review the trace log itself. You should be able to determine the process name/number by searching for 'Starting Process'. Then you can determine if a trace is coded within the process.

Tracing is documented under Sterling Connect:Direct Function Traces.
