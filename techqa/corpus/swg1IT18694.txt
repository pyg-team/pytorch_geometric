APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Mapping node with a Graphical Data Map can fail to deploy, due
   to a map generation internal error. This can occur if the
   mapping includes the use of If/Else transforms to a database
   column as part of an insert or update transform.
   
   A product trace of the deploy failure will show the root cause
   error of the form:
   
   Error: Map <name> could not generate the xquery transformation.
   ErrorCode: 4 Location: 'Insert table <name> column <name>
   Message: 'Missing input value'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It might be possible to avoid the issue by replacing nested
   If/Else transform logic with a Custom XPath transform.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V10.0 who use the Mapping node
   with Graphical Data Maps that include Insert or Update with
   If/Else mappings.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform

   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Graphical Data Map internal generation from the .map file is
   corrected to ensure that If/Else transforms to database columns
   inside a Database Insert or Update are correctly processed.
