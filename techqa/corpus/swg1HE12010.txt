APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While the Notice Sender Timer Task is in progress, individual
   custodians cannot respond to a notice until all recipients for
   that notice have been processed.  Custodians who attempt to
   respond receive the error message: "Recipient need not submit
   any response."  Note that this error only occurs for notices
   which are being sent out for the first time. Reminders are not
   impacted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can wait for the Notice Sender Timer Task to fully complete
   before attempting to respond to any notices received.  Or, you
   can adjust the schedule of the Notice Sender Timer Task so that
   notices are sent overnight or during non-peak hours.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Beginning with IBM Atlas Policy Suite V6.0.1.4, the SQL
   statement which identifies notices requiring a response
   inadvertently became more restrictive than in prior releases.
   With this fix, the SQL statement again allows custodians to
   respond to Notices which have been published but not yet
   completely sent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now on Fix Central as part of IBM Atlas
   Suite 6.0.2 iFix003.
