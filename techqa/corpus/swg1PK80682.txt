ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RFE RATLC01026491 - RFE: Build Forge time out steps are returned
   as pass - states the expected behavior of the product using a
   log filter and a time out event,or TMO, is a PASS. 7.0.2.
   
   For a user with English US as their language this is not the
   behavior observed. The build fails in this case. For a user with
   the language japanese, however this is the case. One of the two
   behaviors are incorrect, and according to the RFE the first
   behavior is incorrect.
   
   Attached step logs for both users and project export.
   
   This has been observed in 7.0.2 iFix 3 and iFix 4.
