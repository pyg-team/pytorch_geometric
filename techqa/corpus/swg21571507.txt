 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I limit Open Secure Shell (SSH) vulnerability? 

SYMPTOM
During a security scan, OpenSSH may be flagged as a vulnerability. This article describes how to alleviate the potential vulnerability. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SSH currently supports protocol versions 1 and 2. The security scan vulnerabilty refers to the SSH protocol version 1.

The default configuration of OpenSSH supports both protocol 1 and 2. To reduce the vulnerability, reconfigure OpenSSH software to restrict connections to be SSH Version 2 or above. No software upgrade should be required.

Recommendation: Ensure that you have access to the Netezza host console in case you inadvertently get locked out of using SSH.


1. Log in as the root user.
2. Open the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file for editing.
3. Uncomment the line that reads # Protocol 2,1
4. Modify that same line to read 'Protocol 2' instead of 'Protocol 2,1'
5. Save your changes.
6. Restart the ssh service by running the following command:
service sshd restart
