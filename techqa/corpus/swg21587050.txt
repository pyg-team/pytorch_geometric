PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unconfigured ITCAM for AD agents still show up in the TEPS console. 

SYMPTOM
After unconfiguring several old ITCAM for AD agents they still appear visible in the TEP view.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The old, unconfigured agents can be removed from the TEP view with the following steps: 

1. Stop the yn agent with this command: $ITM_HOME/bin/itmcmd agent stop yn 

2. On TEP, right-click "Show Navigator List" and remove any copies of the agent in other navigators before clearing the offline entry. 

3. On TEP, right-click and use "Clear Offline Entry" for the remaining yn agent including all the subnodes. 

4. Delete $ITM_HOME/config/<serverName>*yn.ctx files 

5. Start the yn agent with this command: $ITM_HOME/bin/itmcmd agent start yn 

 

At this point, the unconfigured agents should no longer be visible in the TEP.
