Title: IBM How to show the display name of the user that created an annotation instead of the user ID when hovering over an annotation using Daeja viewer. - United States

Text:
Daeja annotation display name user ID TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There is a fix related to this in IBM Content Navigator ICN 2.0.3 fix pack 1. The following is the description of the fix from the ICN 2.0.3.x fix pack readme files:

"IO22008 (IBM Content Navigator users) When adding an annotation using the FileNet viewer, the annotation shows the user ID, not the user short name or display name. This makes it difficult to identify who added the annotations.

With this fix, by default, the tooltip will still show the user ID. If the user display name is desired, the tooltip must be configured in the admin to use the new tag "<creatorname>". This applies to Daeja ViewONE/ViewONE Professional/customAnnotationTooltip.

Example: Created By: <creatorname>, Created On: <createdate>" 

SYMPTOM
When hovering over an annotation in Daeja viewer, the "created by" value shows the user ID rather than the user short name/display name.


CAUSE
The instructions in the fix pack readme above do not explain exactly how to implement the fix.

ENVIRONMENT
Daeja ViewOne and ViewOne Professional

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
ICN 2.0.3 fix packs are cumulative so ICN 2.0.3 fix pack 1 or later will include the fix in question. 




 1. Log into ICN and select the Adminstration View
    
    
 2. Daeja ViewOne. In the "Default custom annotation tooltip" field enter the following:
    
    
    Created By: <creatorname>, Created On: <createdate>
