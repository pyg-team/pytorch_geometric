APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) does
   not handle replication mapping of the same CE class to multiple
   Image Service (IS) external repositories correctly.
   
   Configuration steps:
   -Create same IS class and properties name on the 2 IS servers
   (ISClass1, ISProp1, ISProp2, etc).
   -On CE side via FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) or ACCE, add 2
   Fix Content Devices (FCD) to connect to the 2 Image Services
   (IS) servers
   -Add the 2 External repositories to connect to each of the FCD
   above (IS_REP1, IS_REP2)
   -Add a CE class (CEClass1) to map to both of the above 2
   external repositories
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   Issue 1: Class mappings with same CE class show the same
   External name in ACCE- OS - Replication Mapping tab.
   
   For class mappings added via FEM with same CE class added
   previously, if you view it via ACCE- OS - Replication Mapping
   tab, it shows both with CE class mapping property with the same
   External name.
   FEM reflects the correct External Repository name when you go
   into the configuration of each class mapping 2 class mappings to
   same CE class with different external respository which were
   added via FEM.
   Click on each of the Class mapping each class and BOTH show the
   same External Repository.
   It does not show one for each of the repository.
   
   Issue 2: Duplicate property names appear in the CE mapping
   class.
   
   If you click on ACCE - OS - Replication mapping tab - select a
   CE class mapping -Replication Property Mapping tab - you will
   see all the property names are duplicated. It displays the
   property mapping for both class mappings for same CE class when
   it should only display the property mapping for the class
   mapping selected. Removing the mapping can remove the wrong
   property mapping for the other class mapping.
   FEM does not show duplicate properties.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use FileNet Enterprise Manager.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 or 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 or     *
   * later.                                                       *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 and higher.
   When there are multiple IS external repositories with same set
   of external classes, ACCE should allow multiple class mappings
   between the same CPE class and the same IS class in different IS
   repository.  The associated property mappings should be listed
   correctly.
