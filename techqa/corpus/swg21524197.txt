Single and Double Quotation Marks
The rules for using single and double quotation marks are:
??Single-quote strings allow the parsing of parameters as typed.
??Double-quote strings allow the resolution of symbolic substitution in a quoted string.
The following example shows the use of single quotation marks to enable you to embed special characters or blanks within a parameter or subparameter value.
