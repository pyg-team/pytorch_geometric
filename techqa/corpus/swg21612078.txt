Title: IBM Tracking data is not sent to the Performance Data Warehouse Database for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tracking data is not sent from your Process Server database to the Performance Data Warehouse database. You might notice that the Performance Data Warehouse server is not polling for data and errors are not logged related to the data transfer. You see data build up in the LSW_PERF_DATA_TRANSFER table of the Process Server database. 

SYMPTOM
Using the Performance Admin Console, you can check for these symptoms: 

 * Using "View Statistics" does not show data being inserted in the "TG_*" tables 
 * If you see the following red warning message on the "Welcome" page then it will be one of the two issues: 
   WARNING: There are pending tracking group maintenance actions. Data loading is temporarily disabled until these operations have been completed. 
 * If you do not see the warning message or data transferred, use "View Errors" to see if data is transferred but with errors or confirm that there is an issue with data being transferred.


CAUSE
If you see the warning message on the Welcome screen of the Performance Admin Console, then data transfer is disabled until any pending tracking definitions are deployed. This scenario generally occurs only during the time frame that tracking definitions are being deployed. However, failures during certain stages of tracking definition deployment also cause this issue. 
In IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0.x and later, the Performance Data Warehouse application requires the startup beans service to be enabled. If the startup beans service is not enabled, then the Performance Data Warehouse does not poll for any of the data that is generated by your processes. The startup bean service is disabled, by default, for certain installation scenarios in IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0. 

These issues cause data to continue to build up in your LSW_PERF_DATA_TRANSFER table of your Process Server database until you resolve the issue. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have an issue with the startup beans service, you must enable the startup beans service for each server running the Performance Data Warehouse application. The application is prefixed with "IBM_BPM_PerformanceDW". See the Startup beans service settings [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/webui_pme/ui/ueac_startupbeans.html]topic for more details. Restart your servers after changing this value. 

If you have an issue with the warning message, you need to wait for tracking definition deployment to finish or correct any problems you have during tracking definition deployment. You can resend the tracking definitions for a snapshot by following the directions in the Sending tracking definitions to Performance Data Warehouse [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/pd_gen_sendtracking.html] topic. You might need to restart the Performance Data Warehouse servers after correcting the problem with the tracking definitions. Any errors that occur during tracking definition deployment are logged to the SystemOut.log file for the Performance Data Warehouse server. 

Note: This is the Support cluster in a normal deployment environment topology. 

You need to correct the errors and then resend the definitions. 

 

If you continue to have issues deploying your tracking definitions then you can search the IBM Business Process Manager Support sites for a solution. 

 * IBM Business Process Manager Standard [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/IBM_Business_Process_Manager_Standard] 
 * IBM Business Process Manager Express [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/IBM_Business_Process_Manager_Express] 
 * IBM Business Process Manager Advanced [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/IBM_Business_Process_Manager_Advanced]


[http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/IBM_Business_Process_Manager_Advanced] If you are not sure which tracking groups are causing the red warning messages, you can check the LSW_TABLE table of the Performance Data Warehouse database. The tracking groups that are related to the rows with a REP_STATUS not equal to 0 need to be resent. You can check your processes and toolkits for the use of the tracking group. Auto tracking group names are listed in the tracking tab of the related business process definition (BPD). You can change auto tracking group names. These names generally start with an "a". 

In some cases, using the perfDWTool [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/adminguide/topic/using_perfsvr_commands.html] to review and commit the pending Performance Data Warehouse schema updates will be needed to resolve a failed tracking definition deployment.
