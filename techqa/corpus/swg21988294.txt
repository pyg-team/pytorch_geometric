QUESTION
 How can I determine which installation method has been used to install the IBM BigFIx Remote Control on-demand target? 

CAUSE
When I look at the debug log, I want to know which installation method was used.

ANSWER
The installation method that is used depends on the browser that is being used on the target. However, Java Web Start is available to all browsers as a "fallback" when you click the following link on the landing page. 

 "If the on-demand target fails to start, click here when instructed by the helpdesk agent."

The ActiveX method is used when accessing the ondemand URL with Internet Explorer.
The Firefox plugin is used when using Firefox.
The Java Applet method is used when a browser other than Internet Explorer or Firefox is used. For example, Chrome.

Java Web Start is used only if the user clicks on the link "If the on-demand target fails to start, click here when instructed by the helpdesk agent." on the landing page. This method is a "fallback" method that can be used when the above plugins do not work. It will attempt to launch the target by using an installed version of Java.

How does the target log indicate the method that was used?

This is identifiable by the start of the log.

ActiveX will have several lines prefixed as follows:

[date-time-stamp] AX


Firefox will start with the log entry:

[date-time-stamp]: INFO - Starting IBM BigFix Remote Control ODT Firefox Plugin log


Java applet or Java Web Start will both start with:

[date-time-stamp] - Starting IBM BigFix Remote Control ODT Java Plugin log
