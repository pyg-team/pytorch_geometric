 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities in Node.js and the c-ares library were disclosed on July 11 2017 by the Node.js Foundation. IBM SDK for Node.js has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-1000381 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000381]
DESCRIPTION: c-ares could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the ares_parse_naptr_reply() function when parsing NAPTR responses. By sending specially crafted DNS response packet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read memory outside of the given input buffer and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/128625 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/128625] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-11499 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11499]
DESCRIPTION: Node.js is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a flaw related to constant HashTable seeds. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to flood the hash and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129465 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129465] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.3 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v6.11.0.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v8.1.2.0 and earlier releases.

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf ssh <appname> -c cat staging_info.yml

Look for the following lines:
{"detected_buildpack":"SDK for Node.js(TM) (ibm-node.js-xxx, buildpack-v3.xxx)","start_command":"./vendor/initial_startup.rb"}

If the Node.js engine version is not at least v4.8.4 or v6.11.1 or v8.1.4.0 your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.4.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v6.11.1.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v8.1.4.0 and subsequent releases.

To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=4.8.4"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=6.11.1"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=8.1.4"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application using the IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack v3.13. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
