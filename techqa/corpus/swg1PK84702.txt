ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The fix will make it possible to change all LDAP attributes
   using wp-update-standalone-ldap, except LDAP ID, LDAP host name
   and base DN, without changing the realm name. In order to
   change
   those three attributes, the realm name must still be changed.
   
   Observed exception when running ConfigEngine
   wp-update-standalone-ldap in order to update the LDAP
   bindPassword:
   [wplc-delete-federated-ldap-entitytype] id="..." Delete LDAP
   entity type - result:
   [com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.WIMConfigurationException:
   CWWIM5014E LDAP entity type PersonAccount is not found.]
   [wplc-delete-federated-ldap-entitytype]
   com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.WIMConfigurationException:
   CWWIM5014E LDAP entity type PersonAccount is not found
   
   If the realm name was not changed before calling
   wp-update-standalone-ldap, following messages can be found in
   ConfigTrace.log
   [wplc-create-realm] Realm <name> already exists in the WIM
   Repository System. Continuing with next task.
   and
   [wplc-cleanup-repositories] Repository <repID> not deleted
   because a base entry exists in the default realm.
   and
   [wplc-create-federated-ldap-repository] Repository <repID>
   already exists in the WIM Repository System. Continuing with
   next task.
   
   As a result, some LDAP attributes will not be changed after
   calling wp-update-standalone-ldap.
