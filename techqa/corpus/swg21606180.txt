DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The agent logs show the problem occurs while executing HMC command:
(4FFAA74A.0021-2:hmcquery.c,1233,"execute_envLPARstruct") 
execute_envLPARstruct - command = /usr/bin/ssh -l hscroot HMC "lssyscfg -r lpar -m\"<name>\" -F lpar_env:lpar_id:state" 
(4FFAA74A.0022-2:hmcquery.c,1241,"execute_envLPARstruct") execute_envLPARstruct - command output = HSCL8018 The managed system <name> was not found.

where <name> is the name of the managed system the ITM agent is pointing, and this information is provided during agent configuration.
