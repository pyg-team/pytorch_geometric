PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are experiencing a problem with the WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (FTE / WMQFTE) Nodes with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) on z/OS.

This MustGather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on z/OS systems.
Return to the WMB/IIB MustGather index [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857#show-hide] for other systems. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Consider Using the Test Client in trace and debug mode [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/af52260_.htm].
 2. 
 3. A user level trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663024] is intended to assist users with understanding how their ESQL is processed.
    It will also show a high level view of the message flow behavior.
 4. 
 5. Check for known issues:

    Resolving problems when developing message flows [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au16530_.htm?lang=en]
    [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/tserver/support/]WebSphere Message Broker support site [https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/topic/0TO500000002JCnGAM/integration-bus?language=en_US&productId=01t50000004XS74]
    



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. Complete broker joblog See: Viewing broker joblogs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an20101_.htm]
    
    
     * Send in the joblog for the broker component experiencing the issue.
    
    
 2. 
 3. Project Interchange files for the problematic flow/set/ESQL/model
     * You can export your Message Flow and Message Set project(s) into an archive file for easy transmission to IBM Support.
       See: Importing resources from previous versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc23545_.htm?lang=en] 
    
    
 4. 
 5. Traces If the problem occurs during a runtime test or with the Toolkit test facility, WMB execution group traces [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663024] can be used to gain a better understanding of the problem.  * A user level trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663024#1] is intended to assist users with understanding how their ESQL is processed. It will also show a high level view of the message flow behavior.
     * A service level trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663024#2] is intended to be provided to IBM Support to assist in the diagnosis of your issue.
    
    
 6. 
 7. Related Broker information The following items will be helpful in understanding your specific setup.  * Output the FTEAgent properties stored in WMB 
       mqsireportproperties <broker name> -e <EG name> -o FTEAgent -r 
       using job BIPRPPR.
     * Screen shot of Transfer log in MQ Explorer captured as follows: 
       a. Expand the coordination qmgr in MQ Explorer 
       b. Click on Transfer Log and expand (click on + sign) the failed transactions in the Transfer Log 
       c. Capture a screen shot and send it to support 
     * A directory listing of your <workpath>/common/FTE 
    
    



ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 



STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
