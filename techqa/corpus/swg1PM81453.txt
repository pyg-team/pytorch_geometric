ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After installing AppScan Source Developer Plug-in 8.6 for RAD
   7.5, the install seems to have changed the Ant Home Entries
   under the Ant runtime classpaths (ie, in RAD 7.5, Windows -?
   Preferences -? Ant -? Runtime -? Classpath -? Ant Home Entries
   (Default))
   
   All 24 of the previous ant jars that were part of this directory
   path:
        C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\SDP70Shared\plugins\org.apache.ant_1.7.0.v200803061910
   \lib
   
   has been changed to the following path:
        C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\SDP\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi\bundles\1933\1\.cp\
   lib
   
   To reproduce the problem:
   
   a) Get a machine with RAD 7.5 without AppScan Source Dev Plug-in
   already installed
   b) Check the ant runtime classpath in RAD 7.5 (ie, Windows -?
   Preferences -? Ant -? Runtime -? Classpath -? Ant Home Entries
   (Default) and note the jars that are on the list
   c) Install the AppScan Source Developer Plugin 8.6
   d) check the ant runtime classpath in RAD 7.5 again and notice
   that they have been updated/changed
   
   The current workaround is to re-add the ant classpath entries
   that were removed.
