ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Tools : RAD v6011_ifix001 with WAS v6029 ( plus Java SDK update
   SR4_1) , XI R2 jars are being used for CR XI R2 standalone
   product.
   Attachments
   a) Customer's SQL Server database backup and instructions to
   restore.
   b) My working EAR project (exported from RAD) containing the
   JSPs, Reports
   Recreation instructions:
   a) Create a new database "atptest2" and Restore the data using
   the database backup,using the instrutions provide in attachment
   (a)
   b) Import the EAR project from attachment (b)
   c) Fix the "AgencyTechnologyOverview.rpt" file to point the
   newly created/restored database "atptest2"
   ("AgencyTechOverviews" table)
   d) Run the BeginHere.jsp page (provide "18" value for the
   parameter), it will show the report contents for
   "AgencyStrategy" field
   having the following issues (All the data in this field is
   copied as-is from Word Documents and shows up correctly in the
   external designer.
   ==> Only when the report (report designed in external/embedded
   Designer)  is run on WAS server , following issues occur)
        Issue#1) showing small square shaped boxes instead of
   apostrophes.
        "AgencyStrategy" field's text interpretation can be changed
   by right clicking on it-- format field -- paragraph tab -- Text
   interpretation.
   
        /When the same report is viewed in external CR XIR2
   designer
        a) If "None" is used , the apostrophes show up CORRECTLY AS
   APOSTRPHES.
        b) If "RTF" is used , the apostrophes show up CORRECTLY AS
   APOSTRPHES.
        c) If "HTML" is used , the apostrophes show up CORRECTLY AS
   APOSTRPHES.
        BUT the paragraph-breaks are not shown and the whole
   content shows as one big paragraph on each page. (JUST LIKE ON
   WAS SERVER)
   
        /When running on WAS server
        a) If "None" is used , the apostrophes show up as boxes.
        b) If "RTF" is used , the apostrophes show up as boxes.
        c) If "HTML" is used , the apostrophes show up as boxes.
   Additionally the paragraph-breaks are not shown and the whole
   content
        shows as one big paragraph on each page.
   
     One thing interesting about this ISSUE#1) is, if the
   BeginHere.jsp is made to point to "Untitled2.rpt" (which is made
     on "AgencyOverviews" table in same database "atptest2")
   it shows the apostrophes correctly --(only check the content
     for AtpId=18 and not 19 etc. because that is HTML
   content pasted from an RTF editor)
     . Even though the columns in question
     (ie "AgencyOverview" column in "AgencyOverviews" table
   AND "AgencyStatus" column in "AgencyTechOverviews" table are
   both
     of "ntext" type and have data that's been pasted as-is
   from Microsoft Word documents)
     Having said that, the following Issue#2 and Issue#3
   exist even with this report as well.
   
       We need to fix this issue ( so that the report contents show
   the apostrophes correctly as apostrophes , when run on server)
