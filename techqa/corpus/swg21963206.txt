PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error: E-JPR-000-000: Exception when subscribing to notification : org.omg.CORBA.UNKNOWN: vmcid: 0x0 minor code: 0 completed: Maybe 

CAUSE
From IBM ORB debug log, the above error message was due to a SYSTEM_EXCEPTION thrown by the EMS.

ENVIRONMENT
nco_p_generic_tmf814 GA version 2.0 and Ericsson SOEM (EMS)

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This is because it was found that (and confirmed by Ericsson) SOEM EMS TMF814 implementation only supported STRUCTURED_EVENT. Different from the GA-ed version of the probe; probe-nco-p-generic-tmf814-2_0 which only supported SEQUENCE_EVENT.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade to probe-nco-p-generic-tmf814-2_1 which introduced a new probe property; NotificationClientType. User need to enable and change the property value to 'STRUCTURED_EVENT' after apply the testfix. By default, this property has a value of 'SEQUENCE_EVENT'.
