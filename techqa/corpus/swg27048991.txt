What's new 
Support for using Java SE 6 with WebSphere Liberty ends in September 2017. See removal notice [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_remfeat.html]. After the end of support, the Liberty kernel will be recompiled and can no longer run with Java SE 6. If you continue to use Java SE 6 on earlier fix packs after the end of support date, you could expose your environment to security risks. 

Java SE 8 is the recommended Java SDK because it provides the latest features and security updates.
