   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The left navigation panel of the        *
   *                      process admin console does not          *
   *                      properly display all it's content in    *

   ****************************************************************
   When the amount of content displaying on the left navigational
   panel of the process admin console page exceeds it's default
   height length, content may be cut off by the overlapping panel
   below.  The verticle scroll bar does not become available when
   the content expands beyond the panel's default height.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been implemented to make the veritcle scroll bar
   available when the content exceeds. Users can now scroll
   veritcally to view all content within that panel. The fix will
   be available in fix pack v7.5.1.1 and v8.0.1.0.
