ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  7033 installer hangs
   Customer fixed this issue (installer hangs) by himself, this
   issue use to happen on lots of customers from time to time when
   upgrading RPM, either installing it from automatic server update
   or by running the installer located at this link:
   http://w3-03.ibm.com/transform/project/pmtoolsuite/pmo/install_r [http://w3-03.ibm.com/transform/project/pmtoolsuite/pmo/install_r]
   pm.html.
   Pls notice that on steps followed by the customer, he found that
   one specific program was stopping RPM from installing (at same
   RPM installer).
   
   To debug the installer, customer enabled logging in
   InstallShield, using the following steps:
   1. Start-?Run-?gpedit.msc (Group Policy Control Panel)
   2. Computer Configuration-?Administrative Templates-?Windows
   Components-?Windows Installer (In the left pane).
   3. In the right pane, double-click Logging. Set it to Enabled,
   for logging, specify voicewarmup (all the possible options).
   4. That creates a file in c:/Documents and
   Settings/Administrator/Local Settings/Temp, called
   MSI?something?.log. That shows every step it's taking. Remember
   to turn that back off when you're done (back to 'Not
   Configured'), or every install will generate a 500K log.
   Customer also comments:
    When I enable installshield logging, the last thing I see is:
   Action 14:58:22: ShutdownPMOITray.
   Action start 14:58:22: ShutdownPMOITray.
   When I use SendSignal to send a ctrl-break to the msiexec
   process, the install continues
   Also customer comments on the log file (available if required):
   The place it hung was ~12 pages in. The last thing I saw was:
   MSI (s) (7C:4C) [09:15:58:743]: Doing action: ShutdownPMOITray
   Action 9:15:58: ShutdownPMOITray.
   Action start 9:15:58: ShutdownPMOITray.
    (I'm not sure if that last line was before or after I sent the
   signal)
   After the signal, I get:
   MSI (s) (7C:60) [09:15:58:753]: Invoking remote custom action.
   DLL: C:\WINDOWS\Installer\MSI14EE.tmp, Entrypoint:
   ShutdownPMOITray
   MSI (s) (7C:9C) [09:15:58:753]: Generating random cookie.
   MSI (s) (7C:9C) [09:15:58:763]: Created Custom Action Server
   with PID 4556 (0x11CC).
   MSI (s) (7C:D0) [09:15:58:813]: Running as a service.
   MSI (s) (7C:D0) [09:15:58:813]: Hello, I'm your 32bit
   Impersonated custom action server.
   Action ended 9:17:02: ShutdownPMOITray. Return value 1.
   And so on. I sent the signal more-or-less as soon as it started,
   since I knew it would hang, which is why the timestamps are so
   close.
