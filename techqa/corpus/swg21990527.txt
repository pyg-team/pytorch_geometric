Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple security vulnerabilities affect Liberty for Java for IBM Bluemix - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a potential bypass security restriction vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server. This will only occur in environments that have the webcontainer custom property HttpSessionIdReuse enabled. There is a potential denial of service with IBM WebSphere Application Server when using SIP services. IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, caused by an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect a victim to arbitrary Web sites. IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in OpenID Connect clients caused by improper validation of input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials. There is an Information Disclosure Vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty. Apache Commons Fileupload vulnerability affects WebSphere Application Server. There is a potential information disclosure in WebSphere Application Server.
