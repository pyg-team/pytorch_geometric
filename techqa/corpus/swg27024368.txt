Ask the Experts session 
12 April 2012 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:30 General introduction 03:57 Technical introduction 04:56 What is the WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (FTE) Database Logger? 06:26 Do I need any authority to run WebSphere MQ FTE Database Logger? 08:35 Step 3 of the “Installing the WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition stand-alone database logger” states that I need to run ftelog_tables_db2.sql to create the required database tables. However, when I run the sql file against my DB2 database, I get the error message “SQL0670N The row length of the table exceeded a limit of “4005” byte.” How do I resolve this? 10:56 How do I install and configure WebSphere MQ FTE Database Logger on stand-alone setup? 19:38 How do I install the WebSphere MQ FTE JEE Database Logger? 26:49 Could you please provide a list of links where I might find white papers, technical manuals, business cases and other useful documentation for WebSphere MQ FTE and the Database Logger? 28:45 Can we use the FTE Web Gateway to monitor all FTE transactions, or only the ones processed through the FTE Web Gateway? 31:47 We would like to know how much space is expected to grow the database roughly in a year? 32:33 Are there any downsides to using the COORD, CMD and the AGT Agent as one QMgr instead of three? 34:08 What are the difference are between what the database logger logs vs MQAttach and its ability to audit its transfers through the database, and is it possible to leverage the DBLogger within MQAttach for the front end capability? 35:19 Regarding the Oracle database, we know that the DBLogger logs into the database, is there any script to control the process so that the database doesn't grow all the time, or do we need to write our own script for that? 41:46 Do you have any future plans to implement any other databases other than Oracle and DB2? 42:50 Closing remarks 43:35 End of Call
