APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABEND 0E0 REASON 00000031 in Messaging V700 results when using
   WMQ V6 and earlier Queue Managers configured with IMS Bridge.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not select WMQ Queue Managers which are configured for IMS
   Bridge.
   
   The default KMQUSER generated in RKANCMDU is as below:
   
   * THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ENABLE MQI MONITORING FOR ALL MQ
   APPLICATIONS.
   SET MQIMONITOR STATUS(INSTALL) GROUP(DEFAULT) BUFFERSIZE(32)
   SET APPL NAME(*)
   * THE FOLLOWING COMMAND ENABLES MONITORING FOR ALL QUEUE
   MANAGERS.
   SET MANAGER NAME(*)
   
   By default, the SET MQIMONITOR above enables the MQI hook for
   all queue managers.  To intercept application statistics data
   for queue managers without IMS Bridge configured specify:
   
   SET MQIMONITOR STATUS(INSTALL) MGRNAME(xxxx) BUFFERSIZE(32)
   
   Where 'xxxx' is the desired queue manager name.

   ****************************************************************
   Messaging V700 GA release uses stacking PC to intercept
   application MQI calls. WMQ implements some routines, most
   notably the IMS Bridge, which run in SRB mode. However, in
   WMQ V600 and earlier releases, if a SRB routine is suspended
   and subsequently resumed in the queue manager, the linkage
   stack is not saved. When this happens while the queue manager
   is being monitored by the MQ Monitoring V700 agent, an 0E0
   exception is generated, which can even cause the queue manager
   abend.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQI hook code is fixed to use Basic PC.
