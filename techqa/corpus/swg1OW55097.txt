APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A note opened on a distributed critical event is not 'system
   closed' when a resolving event is received.  This is
   different from how os/390 events are handled.  The notes
   should be 'system closed' when the resolution events are
   received.  In addition, the critical event is not
   cleared from the event viewer in this scenario, which is also
   an error.
