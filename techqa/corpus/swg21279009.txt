QUESTION
In Lotus DominoÂ®, the Event Correlation cache is used as a holding area in which Domino Domain Monitoring (DDM) events are correlated to previously encountered events. When this cache grows to its maximum size, the server reports the following error: 

 * 
 * 
 * 

How do you adjust the cache size? 
ANSWER
The EVENT_CORRELATION_POOL_SIZE is configurable from 5MB to 100MB and defaults to 10 MB. However, note that the parameter is specified in bytes. To set the parameter correctly, choose a desired pool size in megabytes and multiple by 1024 twice. 


Example:
The following is the correct setting to achieve a 100 MB pool size.


 * 


The parameter would then be set as follows. 
 * 


Even with the maximum configured pool size, you may still see the above error. This occurs because Domino creates cached documents that are 2MB in size and the server allows a maximum of 200 cached documents by default. 

Since 2MB x 200 is greater than the maximum allowable pool size, the error can occur unless additional parameters are enacted to control the document size and/or the maximum number of cached documents. The following notes.ini parameters are available for these purposes. 
 * 
 * 
 * 


To ensure that the Event Correlation cache will not be exhausted when configured to the maximum 100MB size, use these parameters so that the following formula is true: 
 *
