QUESTION
 How do I change the overlay used when images are displayed by DotEdit when running the Verify task in MClaims? 

CAUSE
At Verify time, all the form lines have been stripped out of the image. To make it easier for the Verify operator to read the image, an overlay is added to the image which displays the form lines to the operator in addition to the data itself. For some application, new page types are added that require different overlays, or no overlays at all.

ANSWER
This solution assumes that an Attachment type has been added to MClaims and no overlay is desired with that image. However the procedure is the same for any overlay. 

 1. Create an image that is blank and save it as a tif with a supported compression type such as Type 4 in the dco folder within the application. Give it an appropriate name, such as blank.tif. 
 2. Run Taskmaster Web, log in to the application, and select Administrator. 
 3. Highlight the Verify task that will use this Overlay, and click Setup. 
 4. In the DotEdit section, locate the Image Overlay subsection. For this example, set the values as follows:  * Overlay Types - PClaim, Attachment 
     * Background Images - cmst.tif, blank.tif
    
    
 5. Save the Settings.
