Title: IBM Changing the Web Service Proxy response type - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Web Service Proxy response-type defaults to SOAP. How can I change this? I don't see any WebGUI field where I can do so. 

CAUSE
Normally it is not a good idea to change Web Service Proxy (WSP) types, as its main function is SOAP processing. However, if you are sure you want to change the response-type you can do so.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Click on the Web Service Proxy icon to display the WSP list for your domain. The Resp-Type is in the rightmost column of the table. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the WebGUI, select the Objects > Service Configuration > Web Service Proxy menu choice (rather than the Web Service Proxy icon). Then you should find a Response Type field on the Proxy Settings tab.




Or, in the CLI, switch to the application domain where your Web Service Proxy is located:
switch domain <app_domain_name>
Enter configuration mode:
config
then prepare to modify the web service proxy:
wsgw <ws proxy name>
response-type <unprocessed | preprocessed | xml | soap>
exit
write mem

Your response-type modification is made and saved. For Pass through, choose "unprocessed" in the CLI.
