Question 1. SSL enable proxy server ( SHA2 ) still available on reverse proxy. In this case still we need to implement this ?

Question 2: Any one is using load balancer then we need to(traveler URL hosted on load balancer)
still do we need to make changes at IBM Traveler end ?

Question 3: How can I push SSL setting and host update when server is update from http to https ?

Question 4. Are there any other tools I can use to validate that my connection and certificate are secure? 

Question 5. How can I test mobile apps that are enforcing the new security requirements? 


ANSWER
Answer 1: No. If you are defining a Proxy server to allow the mobile app to establish a connection to the Traveler server using a reverse proxy, then the SSL connection endpoint is with the reverse Proxy and not with the IBM Traveler server. 

Answer 2: You have to make sure the your Load balancer is has SHA 2 SSL certificate and TLS 1.2 capability

Answer 3: You can follow the steps as per below tech note to force the setting on device without user intervention

Answer 4: Yes. The example using a FireFox browser given in this article should be accessible in any environment. However, there are a number of publically available tools or sites that can be used to validate secure connections. A popular site is available from Qualys SSL Labs [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/]. Many of these sites only support the standard port 443, so if your Traveler environment is using a non-standard port, you can continue to use the FireFox method. 

Answer 5:Yes. Beta versions of the Apple apps will be released in January 2017 with ATS enabled. You can use these versions to validate that your environments are functioning properly before these apps are available on the Apple App Store. Updates to Verse for Android will follow later in the year. 

The Apple iOS apps can be tested using Apple's TestFlight program, but you must be invited to participate by IBM. Please send an email to heyibm@us.ibm.com [heyibm@us.ibm.com] with the following information for each tester that wants to participate: 

-Tester's Name 

-Tester's email address that is tied to their Apple ID 

-Which apps to test (or all 3), Companion, ToDo or Verse for iOS 

The beta program for Verse for Android is available for anyone wishing to enroll, and you can enroll directly from the Google Play website. Go to the IBM Verse page on Google Play [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lotus.sync.traveler], login with your Google Account, and then click the button called Become a Tester. At this point, if there is a beta version of the app available, you can update it automatically from your mobile device.
