   clearly explain how WebSphere eXtreme Scale is used in the

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Updated the "Planning the communication bridge between B2B
   Advanced Communications and Sterling B2B Integrator" topic for
   our base documentation (B2BAC 1005) by adding the following
   information for procedural point number 1:
   1. Install B2B Advanced Communications, which includes the
   installation of the message provider (WebSphere MQ or WebSphere
   eXtreme Scale).
   Note: An installation of B2B Advanced Communications
   automatically includes a built-in installation of WebSphere
   eXtreme Scale that is used by both production and proof of
   concept installations. For more information on how WebSphere
   eXtreme Scale is used in B2B Advanced Communications, see
   WebSphere eXtreme Scale in B2B Advanced Communications.
