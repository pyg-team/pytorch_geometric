APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You might experience threads hanging while the server starts as
   the server tries to synchronize a large number of user group
   definitions (more than 50 thousand entries) and the number of
   retrieved groups is greater than the number of groups already
   available in the database.
   
   You might see hanging threads with the following stack trace:
   
   Thread "server.startup : 0" (00000011) has been active for
   702995 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s)
   in total in the server that may be hung.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While the server starts, IBM BPM synchronizes all group
   definitions between the applied user registry and the IBM BPM
   database. Before these updates take effect in the database, IBM
   BPM updates the set of groups already available in the database
   by removing entries from the set of groups retrieved from the
   applied user registry. Because a Java core function is used that
   performs very slowly, Java threads might hang if the number of
   retrieved groups is greater than the number of groups already
   available in the database and both the number of already
   available groups and the retrieved groups is very large, such as
   more than 50 thousand entries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V7.5.1.2 that ensures even large
   existing group definitions are processed efficiently by using a
   different group-removal procedure. This procedure ensures the
   processing time is linear depending on the number of group
   entities.
