   Title: Nortel IEMS probe to have the ability to read events
   from an event forwarder
   
   Customer is using Looperng application to receive traps from
   Nortel IEMS, before forwarding the traps to probe. The probe was
   designed to filter out any event that originates other than
   Nortel IEMS. A new property will be introduced with this
   enhancement to recognize the trap forwarder host and IP address
