QUESTION
 How can you enable Common Base Event (CBE) logging without configuring the T6 agent to generate trace logs at the DEBUG_MAX level? 

ANSWER
CBE logs provide problem determination data that is rich in activity and control flow information. This information helps determine the root cause of an issue when a Rational Performance Tester (RPT) script plays back through a T6 agent. 

Typically, CBE logs are used in conjunction with other Robotic Response Time (RRT) trace logs. However, you donâ€™t necessarily need to set RRT tracing to DEBUG_MAX in order to generate CBE logs.

The following are the only steps you need to follow to configure the T6 agent to generate CBE logs.

1) First, log onto your T6 host. Navigate to the following directory. 

Windows: ITM_HOME\kt1depot\T6\RPT
Unix/Linux: ITM_HOME/kt1depot/T6/RPT

This is the top-level repository where the T6 agent saves RPT scripts that it receives for playback on this host.

Open the <script-name>.zip file for one of your current RPT scripts.

In the ZIP file, open the <script-name>.properties file in a plain text editor like Notepad. Note the runtime version in the runtimeVersion property. 

Example:

#Fri Jan 24 19:07:45 EST 2014
runtimeLocation=RPTRUNTIMES/7.5.501.v20120710_1500_44696554.zip
runtimeVersion=7.5.501.v20120710_1500_44696554
appl_name=gsSequoiaPlants
tests=gsSequoiaPlants,
RPTTestType=http
rpt.testClass=test.GsSequoiaPlants_Test_A1E2F07F380C4FE0CBA1B26565383130

2) Navigate to the following directory, where <runtime-version> is the runtime version found above.

Windows: ITM_HOME\TMAITM6\app\RPT\runtimes\<rpt runtime version>
Unix/Linux: ITM_HOME/tmaitm6/app/RPT/runtimes/<rpt runtime version>

3) Check whether the CommonBaseEvents*.log files exist. 

Example:

CommonBaseEvents00.log
CommonBaseEvents10.log
CommonBaseEvents20.log
CommonBaseEvents30.log
CommonBaseEvents40.log
CommonBaseEvents50.log
CommonBaseEvents60.log
CommonBaseEvents70.log
CommonBaseEvents80.log
CommonBaseEvents90.log 

By default, there should be a total of 10 CBE log files. If you are working with IBM Support on a PMR issue, zip up these log files and upload the archive file to the PMR.

4) If these log files are empty, please navigate to the following directory:

Windows: ITM_HOME\TMAITM6\app\RPT\config
Unix/Linux: ITM_HOME/tmaitm6/app/RPT/config

5) Make a backup copy of the following file:

itcamrt-logging.properties

6) Open the itcamrt-logging.properties file in a plain text editor like Notepad (Windows) or vi (Unix/Linux). Set the BWM.trc.rpt.pc.level property to DEBUG_MAX. Also ensure that BWM.trc.rpt.pc.logging is set to true. 

Example:

# RPT Playback Controller TRACE
BWM.trc.rpt.pc.level=DEBUG_MAX
BWM.trc.rpt.pc.logging=true

7) Save the file and restart the T6 agent.

8) Wait for the CBE logs to become populated.

9) Zip up the CBE logs and upload the ZIP file to the PMR.
