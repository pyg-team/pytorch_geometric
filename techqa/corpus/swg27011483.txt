Read all Domino system requirements documentation regarding the specific patches Domino requires for its server. The patch level required by Domino is a prerequisite for successful LEI installation. Hardware requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011483&amp;aid=1]  * 40MB disk space on Win32 
 * 80MB disk space on UNIX and System i 
 * 90MB temp space on Win32 - required by System i LEI Installer 
 * 15MB temp space on Win32 - required by LEI installer 
 * 90MB temp space on UNIX - required by LEI installer

Software requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011483&amp;aid=1]  * LEI 8.0 requires Lotus Notes/Domino 8.0. 
 * Notes 8.0 client to administer the LEI Administrator database and run the LEI server if LEI is installed on a Notes client. 
 * Domino 8.0 server to manage the LEI Administrator database and run the LEI server if LEI is installed on a Domino server. 
 * Client libraries of the external systems to be accessed must be installed on the LEI server and the Domino server. When running activities, if the LEI server and the Domino server are on separate machines, the client libraries must be installed on both machines. 
 * For UNIX - X Window system server environment 
 * For UNIX - X Window system client libraries 

Verify that all of your database software is current with all available maintenance releases and/or fix packs.  * For System i (i5/OS), LEI installation requires Windows Internet Explorer 6.0 or later.

Testing Connectivity [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011483&amp;aid=1] 
The supplied DCTEST program tests connectivity from the system on which the LEI server is installed to external data sources. The LEI server acts as a client to your external data server. Run the appropriate connectivity test program from the Domino server before running LEI. The program names are listed below by platform: 

Issue the following command for Windows: 

ndctest 

Issue the following command for UNIX: 

dctest 

Issue the following command for System i: 

RUNDOMCMD SERVER(your_dom_server) CMD(CALL PGM(QDOMINOxxx/DCTEST)) BATCH(*NO) 

where xxx is the Domino release (for example 703 for Domino 7.0.3) 

A command window help menu provides information using the connectivity test program.
