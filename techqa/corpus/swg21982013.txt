QUESTION
 How can I filter / limit data in the list widget in the Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) to a limited number of entries? 

CAUSE
As an example, a customer would like to filter a 100 OS Agents out of a pool of 500, based on IP address and Hostnames, and have them listed in the List widget. 

ANSWER
1. If those systems can be set in a separate Managed System List: 
In ITM, add those systems to a Managed System List (MSL), also known as 
Managed System Group. This can be done in the TEPS Client in the Edit-->Object Group Editor, in the "Managed System" item, where you can create a new Managed System List (Group) containing just the systems you want. 

2.Filter from within DASH itself: 
In DASH, if you edit the widget that has the ITM data, you can go to "Preliminary Data Filter" to edit the filter. In that Filter, you can create a Rule that looks for the Column "System Name", Condition "equal", and Value being the Managed System List name that you created. 
That way, when DASH submits the query to the ITM Data Provider, it will only return data for those systems.
