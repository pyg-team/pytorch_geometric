APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM SPSS Statistics 21 FP1, exporting a dataset to an Oracle
   11gR2 database will fail if a datetime or time data type is
   used. The resulting error message found in the Output Viewer is:
   
   >Error # 6491.  Text: Case #1 has been dropped
   >Insert record failed
   >Execution of this command stops.
   >[DataDirect][ODBC Oracle Wire Protocol driver]Datetime field
   overflow. Error in
   >parameter 12.
   
   This should not occur and exporting the data to Oracle should
   succeed.
