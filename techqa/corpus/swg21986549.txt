Title: IBM Entry template properties pane has limited height - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Some external add-ons for IBM Content Navigator were observed to have side-effects on the layout of the entry templates properties pane, resulting in the height of the properties pane being distorted. 

SYMPTOM
In IBM Content Navigator entry templates, the properties pane is set to a fixed height of 288px, smaller than the available space on the screen.


CAUSE
In this case, this was a side-effect of a viewer which is available as an external add-on for IBM Content Navigator. The add-on is setting a fixed height for the ICN common properties pane in CSS:

external_addon_style_sheet.css:
.commonPropertiesDiv {
max-height: 280px;
overflow: auto;
}

This is a global change that impacts all areas in IBM Content Navigator where the common properties pane is used. For example, the entry template property layout in the add, check in, properties etc. dialogues, is then restricted to a height of 280px.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 with external viewers configured as an ICN add-on.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To diagnose the problem, review the source code of the properties pane. This can be done for example with the Firebug add-on for Firefox.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Uninstall the external add-on which is causing the problem.
