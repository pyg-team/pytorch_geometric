APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using federated repositories with LDAP, after changing a
   user's password, old attributes remain cached in VMM attribute
   cache. So even after logging in with the new password, the
   "old" attributes can be consulted due to matching externalID
   value.
   
   WAS 8 has an API "clearIdMgrUserFromCache" which allows the
   explicit clearing of VMM attribute cache. This functionality is
   now being backported to WAS 7.
   
   clearIdMgrUserFromCache command

   ecommand.html
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use WebSphere 8 or newer which includes the VMM API
   clearIdMgrUserFromCache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Back port clear cache functionality     *
   *                      for LDAP adapter on V7.0 for            *
   *                      Federated repositories.                 *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Virtual member manager (VMM) handles cache for LDAP data. Data
   remains in the cache until the cache time out is reached. This
   feature will provide a CLI and extra parameters in existing
   CLIs to clear the cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This feature gives a command line interface to clear the LDAP
   cache. This will provide the following two CLIs to clear the
   caches - clearIdMgrRepositoryCache and clearIdMgrUserFromCache.
   
   $AdminTask clearIdMgrRepositoryCache { -id <repo_id> }
   $AdminTask clearIdMgrUserFromCache {-principalName login_ID}
   
   Also existing CLIs like getUser,getGroup,searchUser and
   searchGroup have an extra parameter for clearCache.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 7.0.0.39.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
