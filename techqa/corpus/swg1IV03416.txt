APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On AIX the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS takes more
   than 2 seconds to collect/process information. This
   behavior is due to a 2 seconds sleep in the code
   that is going to be removed and replaced with a
   configurable delay.
   
   Environment: The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS 6.2.2 on AIX
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  UNIX OS agent on AIX takes more than 2 seconds to collect and
   process data.
   
   On AIX, the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS takes more than 2
   seconds to collect and process information.  This behavior is
   due to a 2 seconds sleep in the code that will be replaced with
   a configurable delay.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new environment variable has been added to the UNIX OS Agent
   which can be used to set the delay interval between the two
   process datacollection (getprocs64 API) used to evaluate CPU
   consumption of processes.  The default value is 2000
   milliseconds (2 seconds) but it can be reduced using the
   following key in the ux.ini file:
   KUX_GETPROCS_DELAY=<time in milliseconds>, for example:
   KUX_GETPROCS_DELAY=50
