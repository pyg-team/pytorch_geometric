Text:
bigfix report migrate migration upgrade TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I want migrate BigFix Server and upgrade the same to newer version. Is there a way to migrate web reports from older Server to the newer one's? 

CAUSE
There is not a supported procedure for migrating web reports from an older BigFix version to a newer set up 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to migrate reports saved into BESReporting database into newer BigFix environment, you could proceed as follows:


1. Set up a new environment at the same version 

2. Apply Server migration procedure, as per document below
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Endpoint%20Manager/page/Server%20Migration [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/T] 

3. Upgrade the just migrated Server (and its components) to newer version 

 

Note: this procedure will work for reports creatd inside webreports using the option "save report as" custom report from customized table view.
