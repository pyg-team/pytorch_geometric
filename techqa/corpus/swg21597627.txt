QUESTION
 Why I am seeing errors related to LTPA tokens in the SystemOut.log file? 

ANSWER
Tivoli Integrated Portal uses LTPA (IBM Lightweight Third-Party Authentication) as default authentication mechanism for WebSphere Application Server.
The LTPA time out is configured in the security.xml file in TIP, and by default it is set to 1440 minutes (24 hours). It is an absolute timeout. If the LTPA token times out, then user will be required to authenticate again. 

The following errors indicate that a user logged into TIP and did not log out and left the session open. After LTPA was timed-out, the user tried to access TIP again. This would generate the below error message in the log file. These errors can be ignored.

See below technotes on how to change time out.
