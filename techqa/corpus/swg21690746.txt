This issue will block the uninstall process. 

CAUSE
It has been verified as a installer defect on Windows, Enterprise Content Management System Monitor version 5.2. 

The APAR number is: PJ42736


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Code fix will be provided in ECMSM 5.2 later Fix Pack, for APAR PJ42736. 


Work around un-install steps:
1. In Windows command line: “sc stop cala_rex_cliagent", and then “sc delete cala_rex_cliagent".
2. Delete the directory containing the cala rex installation.
In testing environment the default path is: C:\Program Files\IBM\ECMSM_AGENT.
3. Remove the existing CALA_REX Agent info from Windows control panel.
Just select CALA_REX Agent from the list and the click "Uninstall" button, and click "OK" in the pop up dialog box, to confirm remove this entry.
4. Search the Registry for CALA_REX and delete all the folders that you find. Normally this should not be necessary, the installer should just overwrite the existing registry entries.
