Text:
RAR; WSAD; v5.1_accepted; 1141281 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing a Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file in WebSphere® Studio Application Developer (WSAD) version 5.1, you might get an error at development time or run time.

There are three different possible issues you might face:



 * 
 * If you create a new WebSphere Application Server v5.0 test environment server configuration and try to add a Resource Adapter Name on the Java™ 2 Connector (J2C) tab of the server configuration, you may receive: WAA1350E could not read RAR deployment descriptor. Choose another RAR or cancel this operation. Package with uri "null" not found.
 * 
 * 
 * If you try to add the Resource Adapter name from the Administration Console you may receive an error message saying it cannot add the resource adapter 
 * 
 * 
 * When you try to access your Resource Adapter using JNDI you will receive the following error message:
   com.ibm.websphere.naming.CannotInstantiate ObjectException: Exception occurred while the JNDI NamingManager was processing a javax.naming.Reference object. [Root exception is java.lang.NullPointerException]
 * 




CAUSE
These error messages are caused by two defects in WSAD and another defect in WebSphere Application Server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Unable to add Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) in WebSphere Studio Application Developer server editor:
    This problem is fixed WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1.1. The workaround is to use Administration Console to add RAR file.
    
 2. Unable to add RAR in WSAD administration console:
    This problem is fixed in WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1.1. The workaround is explained in the readme file of WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1; in the "Creating Data sources and Servers in the WebSphere V5 Admin console" section of the readme. The following is an excerpt from the readme:
    
    Creating Data Sources and Servers in the WebSphere v5 Administration Console
    You can receive a NullPointerException or other errors when creating servers using the WebSphere v5 Administration Console within WebSphere Studio. Use the following workaround:  1. Stop the server. 
     2. Copy the templates directory from the following directory (where WS_installdir is the directory with WebSphere Studio):
        WS_installdir\runtimes\base_v5\config\templates
        to your current workspace under:
        workspace_ dir\server_ project\server_ name.wsc folder 
     3. Restart the server and try again.
        
    
    
 3. Receive NullPointerException when accessing RAR resource using JNDI in WebSphere Studio Application Developer v5.1:
    This problem has been reported as defect, APAR: PQ78934.
    To workaround this problem, do the following:  1. Create a dummy Alias:  1. Open the server editor. 
         2. Click the Security tab. 
         3. In the JAAS Authentication Entries click Add. 
         4. Enter any information for the connection. 
         5. Save the editor.
        
        
     2. Add the alias to your connection factory:  1. Open the server editor. 
         2. Click the J2C tab. 
         3. In the J2C Resource Adapters, select the resource adapter. 
         4. In the J2C Connections Factories, select the factory. 
         5. Click Edit... 
         6. In the Component-managed authentication alias drop down menu, select the newly created alias. 
         7. Save the server.
