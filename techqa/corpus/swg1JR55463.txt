ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Knowlege Center Topic: Switching the edition of Java used in
   IBM BPM

   .imuc.doc/topics/tswitchjavaversion.html?lang=en
   
   At step d. iv, there is statement in parentheses ' (where
   jdbc_driver_jar is either ojdbc6.jar for Java 6 or ojdbc7.jar
   for Java 7.1 or Java 7.0)'
   
   According to Oracle's documentation below, we could see that
   for Oracle 11gR2, ojdbc6.jar should be used for both JDK 7 and
   JDK 6.

   bc-faq-090281.html#01_01
   
   
   If that is the case, for Oracle 11gR2, no matter, what JDK
   customer choose from JDK7 and JDK 6, they should both use
   ojdbc6.jar when choosing jdbc jar files.

   - With Oracle 12c R1 Java 6 is supported with the ojdbc6.jar
   driver, and Java 7 is supported with the ojdbc7.jar driver.
