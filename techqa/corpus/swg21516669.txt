PROBLEM
When using IBM Web Experience Factory's silent install feature to install to a RAD environment, you will notice that RAD appears to start without the plugin installed despite successful installation logging.

SYMPTOM
After installation is completed, the target RAD environment is not aware of the Web Experience Factory plugin.


CAUSE
This is due to a problem with the silent install functionality. The link file that should be copied into the RAD IDE's link directory is not copied over. 

ENVIRONMENT
This happens only when installing to a RAD environment with a silent installation script.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to resolve the issue, simply copy the com.bowstreet.designer.link file from the designer\eclipse directory to the installed SDP\links directory for example," C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\links" and run the designer.
