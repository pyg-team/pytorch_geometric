Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Potential security vulnerability in the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console (CVE-2017-1501) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a potential security vulnerability in the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console if you have updated the web services security bindings settings. If you changed the cipher suites in the web services security bindings settings they may not have been saved properly and thus be weaker security then you expected. Verify that your settings are what you expect.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server: 

 * Version 9.0 
 * Version 8.5 
 * Version 8.0 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 If you have recently changed the cipher suites in the web services security binding settings they may not have been saved properly. This only happened for a few fixpack releases. Verify that your settings are what you expect. If you are using any of the affected fixpack levels 9.0.0.0 - 9.0.0.4, 8.5.5.10, 8.5.5.11 or 8.0.0.13 then the recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI80889 for each named product as soon as practical to ensure the web services security bindings settings will get saved properly in the future.
