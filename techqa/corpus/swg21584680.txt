QUESTION
 I'm running OnDemand for iSeries Common Server. I've recently updated some of my OnDemand Client workstations to version 8.5.0.x and we see the message above. What might be causing this? 

CAUSE
Check to see if you still have Spool File Archive (SFA) coexistence defined in your ARS.CFG file. If so, what used to appear as
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584680&amp;aid=1]
when you were running OnDemand Client version 8.4.1.5 or below, now appears as
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584680&amp;aid=2]
for your version 8.4.1.6 or above users. This is because users of version 8.4.1.6+ of the OnDemand Client should not be running Spool File Archive and all previous messages related to Spool File Archive have been removed from the message repository. Not only do these messages appear if co-existence is defined, the OD Client does also NOT connect to the SFA server, thus leading to SFA folders not appearing in the Folder search list and only new or migrated Common Server documents being available for retrieval.


ANSWER
When the migration to Common Server is completed, the link to the old Spool File Archive port should be removed. To remove SFA coexistence, check for the following line in your /QIBM/UserData/OnDemand/QUSROND/ARS.CFG file, where QUSROND is the name of your instance:
ARS_MIGR_SERVERS=SFA as400 2 1445 0 0 


If you see such a line, type a # in front of that line to comment it out. For example:
# ARS_MIGR_SERVERS=SFA as400 2 1445 0 0 

Once you comment out the line above and restart the OnDemand servers (ENDTCPSVR *ONDMD and STRTCPSVR *ONDMD), then the message shown above should not appear after logon.
