Title: IBM Security Bulletin: OpenSSL and OpenVPN vulnerabilities affect IBM Rational Team Concert (CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6329) - United States

Text:
PSIRT; security SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL and OpenVPN vulnerabilities affect IBM Rational Team Concert. OpenSSL and OpenVPN are used by Rational BuildForge Agent shipped with IBM Rational Team Concert. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6329 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6329]

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational Team Concert 4.0 - 4.0.7
Rational Team Concert 5.0 - 5.0.2
Rational Team Concert 6.0 - 6.0.2

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The remediation for this Security issues is to disable triple-DES.

In the Build Forge Agent when triple-DES is enabled, it also enables SSL. 

In order to disable triple-DES follow steps below:


 * 1. Open bfagent.conf file, the file can be located at: 
   Windows default: C:\Program Files\IBM\Build Forge\Agent\BFAgent.conf
   UNIX and Linux default: /etc/bfagent.conf 
   2. Add the following line in bfagent.conf after the line of "SSLProtocol": 
   SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:!RC4:!DES-CBC3:+HIGH:+MEDIUM 
   
   Note: if the build forge agent is not using SSL, comment out this line. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
