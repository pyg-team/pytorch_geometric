QUESTION
 In IBM Security AppScan Enterprise, how can I merge scan jobs and their results from two different databases? 

CAUSE
This may be required to include information from all scan jobs within the same dashboard.

ANSWER
AppScan Enterprise does not offer such a functionality. The best way to achieve this is to: 

 1. Export the job properties of each scan job you need to move to another database. 
 2. Using the exported XML files, re-create identical scan jobs in the target database. 
 3. Run these moved scan jobs. 


However, if the above is impossible, the scan results cannot be moved to the new database. 
Note: You may want to contact the Professional Services to see if they can achieve this, as a service, on a separate contract.
