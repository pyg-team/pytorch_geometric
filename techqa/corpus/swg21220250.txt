Title: IBM Multi-part documents with different mime types for parts - United States

Text:
FixListDocument TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If a document that is imported into IBM® DB2® Content Manager contains multiple content parts, and the various parts have different mime types, then the document cannot be viewed consistently. 

CAUSE
The eClient viewers (viewer applet and the HTML viewer) support a fixed list of mime types that can be viewed. They support each of these mime types individually. Therefore, a multi-part document where all the parts have the same mime type can be viewed properly with the eClient viewers. But if a single document is created that consists of multiple parts of different mime types, it becomes a multi-part/mixed mime type document. The viewer code is currently not capable of supporting such documents. 

For example, the eClient viewers support plain/text and image/TIFF mime types. When you create a document in DB2 Content Manager that has some parts as plain text and others as image/TIFF, it becomes a multi-part/mixed mime type document and cannot be correctly converted and viewed. However, if you create a document that has multiple parts and all of them are image/TIFF, then it can be converted and viewed properly with the eClient viewers.
