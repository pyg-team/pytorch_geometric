Title: IBM TLS fallback protection is available in IBM DataPower appliances - United States

Text:
TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV; MITM attack FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 TLS Fallback signaling cipher suite value for preventing protocol downgrade attacks (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV) is an update to the TLS protocol, currently in an IETF draft document. This has been incorporated into IBM DataPower appliances. 

CONTENT
DataPower has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol downgrade. 


Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to a lower protocol (like SSL 3.0) even if both sides of the connection support higher protocols. Lower protocols such as SSL 3.0 contain a number of weaknesses including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).


TLS fallback protection is available in 6.0.0.12, 6.0.1.8, 7.0.0.5, and 7.1.0.0. Refer APAR IT05922 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT05922] for URLs to download the fix.
