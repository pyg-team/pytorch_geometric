APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Certificate validation based upon strict security from RFC5280
   may indicate errors that were previously unnoticed.

   *                      Plugin uses modern defaults for         *
   *                      SSL/TLS processing. This includes       *

   ****************************************************************
   Errors with certificates may be indicated which previously
   were not indicated. This is because strict security based upon
   RFC 5280 is now enforced by default.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problems seen fall into the following certificate processing
   related categories (See RFC5280 for complete details):
   
   BasicConstraints extension: All certificates used to validate
   digital signatures (AKA issuers, signers, or CA's) must
   contain a BasicConstraints extension with the "criticality"
   field set to TRUE.
   
   CertificatePolicies extension: The CertificatePolicies
   extension must be RFC5280 conformant across the certificate
   chain. The algorithm is quite complex, but in a simplifed form
   an intermediate signer cannot assert policies not also
   asserted by its own signer.
   
   The certificate validation changes introduced in PI39126 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI39126] can be
   disabled, by setting the WAS Plugin custom property
   "certificate_validation_strict_rfc5280=false" on the Plugin
   Custom Properties panel.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in fix pack 8.0.0.12 and
   8.5.5.8.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
   delivery information:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]
   
   The custom property can be set during plugin configuration
   generation in 8.5.5.8, 8.0.0.12 or 7.0.0.41 but the version 7
   plugin runtime will not recognize the property (this is added
   to v7 to allow v8 or v855 configurations to be generated).
   
   WebSphere is required to be at the specified level for the
   custom property to be placed in the generated plugin-cfg.xml
   file. The plugin module residing on the web server MUST be at
   the specified level for the custom property to have the
   desired effect.
   
   The property can manually be added to the configuration
   post-generation to avoid upgrading WebSphere. If the property
   is manually added to the plugin configuration file, it must be
   placed within the "Config" tag. For example:
   <Config ... certificate_validation_strict_rfc5280="false" ... >
   (... represents other properties which may be present within
   the Config tag)
