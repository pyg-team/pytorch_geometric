PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  RESOLUTION SUMMARY:
   
   A code fix is provided.
   
   As part of addressing this issue, we have created two new BPML
   parameters for the Crypto Message Service.
   
   1. pipeSize -     Size of the pipe (in bytes) created for
   carrying out the pipeline activities.
                            Defaults to a value of 4096.
                            Optional.
                            Allowed values - any valid non-negative
   integer values
                            NOTE :-
                                          1. The pipeSize value
   should always be greater than the bufferSize value.
                                          2. This parameter shall
   be used only when dealing with large MIME headers where the
   header size is > 1024 bytes.
   
   
   2. bufferSize -     Size of the buffer(in bytes) to hold the
   incoming data.
                              Defaults to a value of 1024.
                              Optional.
                              Allowed values - any valid
   non-negative integer values
                              NOTE :-
                                            1. The pipeSize value
   should always be greater than the bufferSize value.
                                            2. This parameter shall
   be used only when dealing with large MIME headers where the
   header size is > 1024 bytes.
