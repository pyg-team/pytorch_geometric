   ****************************************************************
   In a federated repository, adding a base entry of "root" on some
   LDAP servers, such as Microsoft Active Directory, causes login
   failures after server restart.
   This error is seen in the dmgr JVM log.
   E
   com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection search(String,
   String,Object[], SearchControls)
   com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.WIMSystemException: CWWIM4520E
   The 'javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: [LDAP: error code 32 -
   0000208D: NameErr: DSID-031001A8, problem 2001 (NO_OBJECT), data
   0, best match of: '']; remaining name '/'; resolved object
   com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@45564556' naming exception occurred
   during processing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If root is entered in the administrative console for the unique
   distinguished name of the base entry field, the LDAP server
   type
   is checked. If the use of root to indicate an empty base entry
   name is not supported, an error message is displayed and the
   user must enter a valid base entry.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 8.0.0.14, 8.5.5.12 and 9.0.0.5.  Please refer to the
