QUESTION
 How long does it take to upgrade Gentran from one release to another? 

ANSWER
We can only give rough estimates because no two companies are the same. Here are some figures from a few past implementations.
Gentran:Basic 
Install = 1 week to build and execute JCL, CICS, and finish Install manual Verification steps.
Conversion = 3 days involved in Conversion JCL and checking Condition codes. 
Implement = 2 weeks in getting JCL processes adjusted, impact of enhancements and parallel testing

The add-on products upgrade time sways too wide to give estimates. There is less to build in the way of CICS and JCL structures since Gentran:Basic would have already been installed, but more time is required in building up the systems around the add-ons.
