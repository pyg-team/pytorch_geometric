ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the WCM Authoring UI, in some cases (normally only
   when session replication or persistence is enabled) you may see
   a 'com.ibm.ws.logging.WsLogger ' is not serializable exception
   such as:
   
   [1/30/13 5:10:20:038 CET] 00000087 WASSession E
   SessionContextMBeanAdapter findAttCausingNotSerializableExceptio
   
   n Miscellaneous data: Attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B
   
   1020746_tm" is declared to be serializable but is found to
   generate exception "java.io.NotSerializableException" with
   message "com.ibm.ws.logging.WsLogger ". Fix the application so
   that the attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B1020746_tm"
   is correctly serializable at runtime
   
   This defect is to handle correcting multiple references to the
   WAS logger to be 'static' so that its not attempted to be
   serialized when the parent class is serialized.
   
   Opened for release 7002

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the WCM Authoring UI, in some cases (normally only
   when session replication or persistence is enabled) you may see
   a 'com.ibm.ws.logging.WsLogger ' is not serializable exception
   such as:

   n Miscellaneous data: Attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B
   
   1020746_tm" is declared to be serializable but is found to
   generate exception "java.io.NotSerializableException" with
   message "com.ibm.ws.logging.WsLogger ". Fix the application so

   Opened for release 7002
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis: The serialization exceptions are coming from
   serializable classes which happen to have member 'logger'
   variables which are not static and therefore the parent class
   fails to be serialized. Given its difficult to track down
   exactly which classes are the problem, I've searched through the
   code and corrected all non-static references to logger to be
   static
   Solution: Changed all references to logger to be static
