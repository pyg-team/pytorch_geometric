Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx - Robotic RPT - script with digital certificate RCS file playback fails - United States

Text:
RPXE5103I GENERIC_FAILURE 71INS-RRT 71RRT-RPTPLAY 71RRT-RPTTS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using ITCAMfTx, RPT script playback on Robotic (T6) agent, where the test script includes a digital certificate .rcs file, fails with error, and violated value is seen in ITM TEP Robotic Playback workspace. 

SYMPTOM
Following error messages are seen in CBE "CommonBaseEventXX.log" files on the RRT (T6) agent, after Rational Performance Tester (RPT) script playback was attempted and failed. CBE logs are located under : 

 ./TMAITM6/app/RPT/ runtime 
directory, once CBE log tracing has been enabled in the RRT (T6) agent properties files.

(remark : procedure for enabling extra tracing and generating CBE logs for RPT script playback on ITCAM for Tx RRT (T6) agent, is found in section 7.2 of this technote: [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326667]
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326667 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326667]
)

CBE log error message found:

"The digital certificate RCS file 
C:\IBM\ITM\tmaitm6\app\RPT\tmp\managed-jvm\<rpt_run_time>\xxxxxx.rcs 
was not found or was corrupt: java.io.IOException: Error in loading the keystore: Private key decryption error: (java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size)" 

and

"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot support 
SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA with currently installed providers"


Other error messages found in BWM/logs/trace-robotic.log as well :
"ERROR ... 
PlaybackThreadPoolWorker 
com.ibm.tivoli.transperf.playback.Playback.completeEventClearing(String)"
...
"eventType=GENERIC_FAILURE,expectedValue=The digital certificate RCS file 
'C:\IBM\ITM\tmaitm6\app\RPT\tmp\managed-jvm\<RPT_RUN_TIME>/<certificate_file_name>.rcs' 
was not found or was corrupt"

"java.util.zip.ZipException,violationData=The digital certificate RCS file 
'C:\IBM\ITM\tmaitm6\app\RPT\tmp\managed-jvm\<RPT_RUN_TIME>/<certificate_file_name>.rcs 
was not found or was corrupt" 

"But actually the <certificate_file_name>.rcs file exists in 
C:\IBM\ITM\tmaitm6\app\RPT\tmp\managed-jvm\<RPT_Run-Time> directory,
So it was exported successfully as well as other elements of the test script to the ITCAM for Tx AMC T3 console, following the export of the script from RPT Workbench."


CAUSE
The JCE policies currently installed on the ITCAMfTx RRT T6 agent are possibly not sufficient to open and decode correctly the certificate file.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Download and install the unlimited jurisdiction policy files : 


A) Download the unlimited jurisdiction policy files for your currently in use java environment 
refer to : http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.60.doc/security-component/sdkpolicyfiles.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.60.doc/security-component/sdkpolicyfiles.html] 

B) Install on the RRT T6 ITCAMfTx agent
=============================== 
backup and rename the current files in place (US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar), located for example under TMAITM6/javaXX/jre/lib/security directory 

Extract the new ones you have downloaded and install them in the same place 
(TMAITM6/javaXX/jre/lib/security) 

Recycle the T6 agent.

Check next script playback results in the ITM TEP Robotic playback workspace.

Check in the trace-robotic.log files and verify the current version of java environment that is in use to playback your RPT script(s), so you know which version of Java jurisdiction policy files to download and replace on the T6 agent
