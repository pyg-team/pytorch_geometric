CWWIM2008E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SystemOut.log file reported the following:
CWWIM2008E The principal 'AnonymousUser' is not authorized to perform the operation 'GET PersonAccount' on 'uid=OMERS\XXXXXXX,o=twaLocalOS' 0000003b exception E
com.ibm.websphere.wim.security.authz.AccessException 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem solved by removing LocalOS from the repository and configuring for LDAP. Fresh install uses LocalOS. The system was a member of an Active Directory domain and the user was a domain user. WebSphere uses older APIs with the localOS setting.
