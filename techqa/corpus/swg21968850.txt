Title: IBM The "Open with Report Studio" Icon from Cognos Connection is missing - United States

Text:
Icon Disappeared; Icon Missing; Cognos Viewer icon missing. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The "Open With Report Studio" iIcon (Inverted Triangle Icon) in the Cognos Connection is no longer visible. 

CAUSE
This is usually observed when the following advanced parameters are enabled for the entire dispatcher, instead of just the ReportService and/or BatchReportService:
1. VIEWER_ENABLE_SORT=TRUE
2. VIEWER_DISABLE_SECONDARY_SORT_FOR_LISTS=TRUE

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos 10.2.2

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In IBM Cognos Administration > Configuration > Dispatchers and Services > Set Properties Configuration > Settings > Environment > Advance Setting check to see if the below settings exists:
1. VIEWER_ENABLE_SORT=TRUE
2. VIEWER_DISABLE_SECONDARY_SORT_FOR_LISTS=TRUE.
If they are set then while running the reports the Open With Report Studio Inverted Triangle disappears.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Removed these advanced parameters from the dispatcher's advanced settings and keep them only for the ReportService and BatchReportService.
