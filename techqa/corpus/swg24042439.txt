SUPPORTED LANGUAGES
Adding support for additional languages on Windows 10 
To support additional non-English platforms, you must edit and test the AccessProfile before you upload it. 
Before you begin
Connect to a remote host through Remote Desktop Protocol which prompts you with the localized version of the Windows Security dialog box on Windows 10. 

For example: 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042439&amp;aid=1]

Follow the procedure below to edit the AccessProfile: 

 1. Open the AccessProfile. 
 2. In the AccessProfiles pane, open profile_credui_win10. 
 3. Make the following changes:

a. In the States tab, look for the win10security dialog found state. 
b. Select the Localization Support -Script action that is illustrated in the following image. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042439&amp;aid=2] 
c. Open the VBScript in the Script Editor. 
Note: Several arrays have been provided, each containing a list of translated strings for specific locales that are supported by the product. d. Identify the locale that must be changed and look for the corresponding VBScript array. 

In the CurrentLocaleArray function, update the parameters, <parameter1> and <parameter2>, that are assigned for your required language. 


<Language_Code>= Array("<parameter1>","<parameter2>") 

"<parameter1>" refers to the strings containing IP Address for Internet Explorer, Windows Explorer and RDP. 

"<parameter2>" refers to the strings containing the Name property. 

For example, to modify strings for Chinese, look for zh_cn. 

zh_cn = Array("<parameter1>","<parameter2>")

The diagrams are provided only as an example. 

The provided non-English language phrases that you find in the AccessProfile for <parameter1> and <parameter2> are only place holders and must be updated. 

Windows Security Dialog Box in Windows 10 Parameter for identifying the Windows Security dialog box on Windows 10 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042439&amp;aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042439&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042439&aid=4] 
Note: In the regular expression for English, en_us, in parameter1 you will notice the following phrase: 
"|connect to: (.*)" 
This regular expression is used only to match the label that is originally available in an earlier version of Windows 10, Version 1511. 

Tip: If you want to match additional phrases that might be displayed, use the ' |' operator.  

4. Repeat or copy the changes that you made in step 3 to profile_RDP_main_win10, in the AccessProfiles pane.
