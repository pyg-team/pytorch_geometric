ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CAF rejection error occurs frequently for user as well as cognos
   system admin for a portal tab that has drill down reports based
   on a cube source. The reports run but once you do a drill down
   sometimes it throws the error and sometimes it does not.??The
   same reports work fine in the portal page once created and the
   issue happens only when it is added as a portal tab.??Adding to
   the domain list in cognos configuration doesnt make any
   difference.????workaround: turn off CAF but not acceptable to
   customer.
