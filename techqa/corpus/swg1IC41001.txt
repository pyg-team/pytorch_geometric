ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   After upgrading to ClearCase(R) 2003.06.12 (SR2), using Visual
   Studio(R) 6.0 SP5 with a snapshot view displays the following
   error as a pop-up window:
   
   "The Source Code Control project could not be initialized."
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Apply ClearCase 2002.03.12 (SR2)
   2. Turned on SCC debugging trace level to 2
   
   To turn on SCC tracing:
   
   Start regedit, Start-->Run-->regedit
   
   NOTE: Backup your registry before making this change.
   
   Go to:
   
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Atria\ClearCase\CurrentVersion\
   
   If there is no subkey named "SCC", add one. With the SCC key
   selected, add a new DWORD Value. The Value name must be
   "DebugTrace". Set the value 2 which will write the log file to
   
   <clearcase-home-dir\Rational\ClearCase\var\log\ccscc.log
   
   3. Create a VOB, if one does not exist.
   4. Create a snapshot view and load new or existing VOB.
   5. Opened Visual Studio 6.0 and create a new Visual C++ project
   in the snapshot view/vob context.
   6. Within Visual Studio, right clicke on the project and select
   "add to source control", which causes the following error in a
   pop-up box:
      "The Source Code Control project could not be initialized."
   
   7. The ccscc.log file will show the following errors: as

LOCAL FIX
 *  The error does not occur when using Dynamic Views
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Two callers to the same cache can cause problems.  Reading of
   the cache in ws_get_handle has been modified to ensure the cache
   is valid before using it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available in the following releases and all
   subsequent releases:
   clearcase_p2002.05.00-40
   clearcase_p2002.05.00.NT-34
   clearcase_p2003.06.00-14
