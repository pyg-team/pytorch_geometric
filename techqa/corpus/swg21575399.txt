Title: IBM Intermittent "AAA-SYS-0001 - An internal error has occurred ... AAA-HDR-0001 Multiple values specified for variable 'cam_passport" when running Standard Reports - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User runs a standard report (for example "Reconcile - Between Accounts/Opening Balances" or "check rules for automatic journals" report (Maintain > Special Utilities > Verify Structures). User receives error message.

Problem is intermittent - the report will typuically work for the vast majority of times, but then (later on) it will fail. Typically it will fail after the end user has been idle in the system (e.g. left the system running in the background whilst away from their desk for a long time). 

SYMPTOM
Reconcile - Between Accounts/Opening Balances (Preview) 

IBM Cognos software
AAA-SYS-0001
An internal error has occurred

Details:
java.lang.RuntimeException: com.ibm.cognos.camaaa.internal.common.exception.SingleValueExpectedException: AAA-HDR-0001 Multiple values specified for variable 'cam_passport' when a single value is expected [/SOAP-ENV:Envelope/SOAP-ENV:Header/bus:biBusHeader/bus:hdrSession/bus:cookieVars].AAA-HDR-0001 Multiple values specified for variable 'cam_passport' when a single value is expected <...........>

CAUSE
User's Cognos BI authentication ("CAM") session has expired because the user has been idle for too long in the system. 

 
More Information:
By default, the CAM security passport will expire after 60 minutes (1 hour) of inactivity. This means that the problem will often/typically be seen by users who have been 'idle' in the system for more than 1 hour (for example after returning from lunch).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Increase the authentication (security) timeout value. 

 * For example, increase it from the default (3600 = 1 hour) to a larger amount (e.g. 7200 = 2 hours).

 * Steps:
 *  Obtain a short period of downtime (no users on the system) Logon to the 'Report Server' (typically, many customers only have one server, so this will be the Controller application server itself) as a Windows administrator From the Start Menu, launch "Cognos Configuration" Open the section "Local Configuration - Security - Authentication" Modify the setting "Inactivity timeout in seconds" from the current (defeult 3600) to something higher (e.g. 2 hours = 7200). Click "Save" Click the 'Restart' icon (which restarts the Cognos BI service).

Workaround: 
Simply logoff from Controller, then launch the Controller client, and re-try.
