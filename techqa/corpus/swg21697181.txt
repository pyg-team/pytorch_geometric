 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 6 and 7 that are used by IBM InfoSphere Information Server. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2015. This bulletin also addresses the “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability.

A vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM WebSphere Application Server and Progress Software DataDirect Connect ODBC drivers that are shipped as components of IBM InfoSphere Information Server. Information about this Bar Mitzvah security vulnerability has been published in a WebSphere Application Server security bulletin. Information about this vulnerability and Progress Software DataDirect Connect ODBC drivers is below. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

For IBM InfoSphere Information Server versions 8.0 and 8.1, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. 

You should verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

Additionally, perform the remediation step for the DataDirect Connect ODBC drivers per information in the "Workarounds and Mitigations" section. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all InfoSphere Information Server releases, disable RC4 stream cipher usage in the Progress Software DataDirect Connect ODBC drivers. For details, refer to TechNote http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883537 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883537]
