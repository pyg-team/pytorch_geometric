COMMENTS
 *  Problem summary:
   In WebSphere Application Server Version 6, a connection is made
   to MQ using a client mode JMS connection, and a non-transacted
   JMS session is created from the JMS connection.
   
   If the JMS session is subsequently used while a WebSphere
   transaction is active, the JMS session may incorrectly determine
   that its work should be part of the active WebSphere
   transaction.
   
   This can result in messages being put with MQPMO_SYNCPOINT set
   in the MQPMO options.
   
   As WebSphere does not expect the session to perform work in the
   transaction, no commit is performed on the session when the
   transaction completes.  This can result in the messages which
   were put remaining uncommitted.
   
   Problem resolution:
   The MQ JMS code has been updated to correctly detect that the
   JMS session is not part of the WebSphere transaction, and
   perform message puts outside of syncpoint.
   
   This fix changes the Java component of MQ, and will be included
   in FixPack 7.0.1.3 (PM09662 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM09662]).
