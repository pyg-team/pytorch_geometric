APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Application Server V7.0 trace has been collected for
   analysis of the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter component.  IBM
   Support indicates that this trace does not capture the
   ConnectionConcurrency property at the appropriate server scope.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere Application Server v7.0
   that are collecting trace from the WebSphere MQ Resource
   Adapter, for analysis by IBM Support.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The ConnectionConcurrency property of the V7.0 WebSphere MQ
   Resource Adapter must be configured at the cell scope within the
   WebSphere Application in order to change the behaviour of the
   JMS Connection object sharing between multiple MDBs.
   
   However, the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter trace was recording
   the value set at the server scope.  This prevents IBM Support
   from determining what the value has been set to on a customer
   system, for which trace has been provided.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Additional trace statements are added to the code to print out
   the ConnectionConcurrency property at the appropriate scope when
   the endpoint is activated.
