Text:
ghostcr; ghosttask TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is a ghost CR and a Ghost task and how can I identify them in IBM Rational Change? 

ANSWER
Ghost CRs and tasks are local copies on a remote database in a Central Change cluster. 

Ghost CRs have 2 special attributes 

 * is_ghost_problem (boolean) 
 * central_cvid (cvid of the real CR in the central database)


Ghost Tasks have 1 special attribute 

 * is_ghost_task (boolean)


If there are timezone differences between the central and remote servers then note: 

 * Dates entered into query are assumed to be central server time 
 * Date is always displayed in central server time zone.
