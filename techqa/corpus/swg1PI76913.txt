ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Integration Bus ( IIB ) V10 on z/OS received multiple
   abends.  The joblog had errors:

   There is an issue with the management of stack storage when
   using message callbacks.
   
   When a message is too large for the buffer allocated in the
   application address space, the queue manager processing calls
   back to the application address space to allocate larger
   storage.
   
   If the task's stack in the queue manager address space has a
   virtual address that falls in the stack segment in the
   application address space, MQ incorrectly calculates the
   amount of storage to be allocated. This causes a reduction in
   the available stack storage in the application address space
   for that task. If the same task makes several calls of this
   type, we can exhaust the stack segment which causes the
   tasks to abend 5C6-EBEBEBED.
   
   It appears that this leaves an invalid state which causes
   follow-on 0D3 abends.
   
   
   Update Aug 9, 2018:
   While reports of this problem have so far only been received in
   an IIB (IBM Integration Bus starting with V10), it is possible
   for this issue to occur with any connected application that
   makes use of async consume or message property handles.
   The main factor that makes this problem rare is that the two
   stack storage allocations for the allied address space and the
   MQ MSTR have to have overlapping address ranges to experience
   the problem.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 9       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQ application using async consume may  *
   *                      abend with 5C6-EBEBEBED or              *
   *                      0D3-00000013.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   The stack storage management code incorrectly determines whether
   an additional stack segment is present in the stack chain and
   modifies the stack pointer to compensate. As the additional
   stack segment is not present this calculation is not rolled back
   when releasing the stack storage and eventually the hard limit
   on stack sizes is breached, causing an abend to occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Stack storage management for the affected modules is amended to
   ensure that the stack pointer calculation is now correct.
