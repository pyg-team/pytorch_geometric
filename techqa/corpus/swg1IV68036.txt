APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide erroneously
   documents that the Event Integration Facility (EIF) can be setup
   to send events directly to Netcool/OMNIbus EIF receiver probe
   using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
   
   Sending private (autonomous) events from ITM using the Event
   Integration Facility (EIF) does support the ability to use
   TLS/SSL communication.  This communication requires an EIF
   receiver that supports TLS/SSL communication.
   
   The ITM documentation states that events can be sent to a
   Netcool/OMNIBus EIF receiver probe using TLS/SSL communication.
   This is incorrect as the probe does not support TLS/SSL
   communication.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See conclusion below.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The documentation updates below are across ITM versions for 6.23
   and 6.30.

   Sending private situation events by using TLS/SSL communication
   
   This wording is incorrect:
   You can now send your private situation events to a
   Netcool/OMNIbus EIF receiver probe using TLS/SSL communication.
   The destination Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for TivoliÂ® EIF must be at
   version 12.0 or later.
   
   Corrected wording:
   You can now send your private situation events to an EIF
   receiver that supports TLS/SSL communication.  The
   Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF does not support TLS/SSL
   for receiving events.

   This wording is incorrect:
   You can now send your private situation events to a
   Netcool/OMNIbus EIF receiver probe using TLS/SSL communication.
   The destination Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF must be at
   version 12.0 or later.
   
   Corrected wording:
   You can now send your private situation events to an EIF
   receiver that supports TLS/SSL communication.   The
   Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF does not support TLS/SSL
   for receiving events.

   #7 incorrectly states:
   Note: If an SSL connection will be used between the probe and a
   monitoring agent, ensure that you have version 12.0 or later of
   the probe.

   Incorrect wording:
   The Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF supports both SSL and
   non-SSL connections with monitoring agents. If you want to use
   an SSL connection, you must have version 12.0 or later of the
   probe.
   
   Corrected wording:
   The Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF supports non-SSL
   connections with monitoring agents

   The following wording should be removed:
   If the Netcool/Omnibus EIF probe uses a CA-signed digital
   certificate and channel_nameSSLRequireClientAuthentication=YES
   is specified in the probe?s configuration file, you must ensure
   that the monitoring agent?s key database has imported a
   corresponding CA-signed digital certificate.
   
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring requires a CMS-type key database, whereas
   Netcool/OMNIbus requires a Java Key Store (JKS) database. The
   keyfile.kdb CMS key database file is installed in the
   install_dir\keyfiles directory. However, you cannot use this
   database in its current form if you require a CA-signed digital
   certificate when sending events over an SSL connection to the
   Netcool/OMNIbus EIF probe.

   The following line should be removed:
   If you want to configure SSL between the probe and monitoring
   agents, version 12.0 or later of the Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for
   Tivoli EIF is required.

   The following lines should be removed:
   Using TLS/SSL to secure communication between a monitoring agent
    and the IBM IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF
   Version 12 or later
   
   Use TLS/SSL for sending private situation events from monitoring
    agents to the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Tivoli EIF.
   For this interaction, client certificate authentication is
   configured so that the probe uses certificates to authenticate
   the monitoring agents (the clients).
