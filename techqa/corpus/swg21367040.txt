Title: IBM EJB deploy fails when installing an EAR which librairies with the same name - United States

Text:
ejbdeploy; Colliding project name; jar; EAR; An unexpected exception was thrown; Halting execution; ADMA0086E; ADMA0158I TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the EJB deployment task with the WebSphere Application Server version 7 using the Administration Console, a DeployEJBTask error occurs. 

SYMPTOM
During the EJB deployment task with the WebSphere Application Server version 7 using the Administration Console the following errors occur: 


...
[12/17/08 14:51:10:325 CET] 00000107 DeployEJBTask E ADMA0086E: 
[EJBDeploy] An unexpected exception was thrown. Halting execution. 
[12/17/08 14:51:10:325 CET] 00000107 DeployEJBTask I ADMA0158I: 
[EJBDeploy] Shutting down workbench.
[12/17/08 14:51:10:356 CET] 00000107 DeployEJBTask I ADMA0158I: 
[EJBDeploy] Error importing: Colliding project name " project_EJB 
" between archives " Test_EJBs.jar " and "
TestInstall/TestinstallJar/Test_EJBs.jar "..


This error can be observed as well when trying to install a EAR using Add/Remove Projects in Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) or Rational Software Architect (RSA).



CAUSE
The error happens in an EAR which contains multiple libraries having the same name. The EAR import tries to bring in those libraries as projects whereas they should be imported as jars only.
For example, this could occur when an ejb .jar file is used as utility jar and it is located in the library folder and the tool tries to import the it as an EJB project.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The project name collision error could be a correct error and occurs under any of the following 

conditions:


 * You specify a project name that already exists. 
 * You specify the same name for two modules. 
 * You specify a name for a module project that is the same name as the enterprise application project.


If your case does not match any of the above scenarios, the problem could be related to a known issue that is being addressed by defect APAR PK78425. This fix is already available for the RAD versions 7.5 and 7.5.1, please contact Rational Client Support to verify and obtain the patch.
