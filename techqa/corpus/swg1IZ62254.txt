   This APAR tracks the release of update 1.0.0.2 of the IBM CICS
   Explorer. This update adds support for viewing, updating and
   creating CSD definitions within CICS regions running CICS TS
   4.1. This update also fixes a number of minor bug fixes, as well
   as providing compatibility for the recently released plug-ins
   for the CICS Explorer by IBM CICS Performance Analyzer, IBM CICS
   Configuration Manager, and IBM CICS Interdependency Analyzer.
   More information on these plug-ins can be found on the following
   website:
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/explorer/download/ [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/explorer/download/]
   
   Note: The CSD access is only available when connecting to CICS
   TS 4.1 regions with the following PTFs, and is not available
   when connecting to CICS TS version 3 regions:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Version 1.0.0.2 has been released for IBM CICS Explorer. This is
   available via two options:
   
   1. Update the CICS Explorer from within the CICS Explorer using
   the IBM-hosted Update-Site
   2. Download the update from Fix Central to be installed locally
   into the CICS Explorer.
   
   Updating using the Update-Sites
   To update the CICS Explorer using the Update-Site follow the
   instructions below:
   
   * Start CICS Explorer
   * Select Help -> Software Updates... from the main menu
   * Click the Installed Software tab and click Update...
   * An update should be found for the CICS Explorer, verify that
   the update version is 1.0.0.2_200909240951 or higher

   Note: The version of the CICS Explorer may now be higher than
   1.0.0.2 as the update updates to the latest version of the CICS
