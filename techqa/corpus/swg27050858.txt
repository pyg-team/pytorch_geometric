About Fix Pack 18.0.0.1 
Fix Pack 16.0.0.2 introduced new fix pack numbering for common Liberty fix packs that apply to both Version 8.5 and Version 9.0 of WebSphere Application Server on all supported platforms. You can use files from the Fix Pack 18.0.0.1 download page [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044285] to update Liberty for both WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 and Version 9.0.

Support for using Java SE 6 with WebSphere Liberty ends in September 2017. After the end of support, the Liberty kernel will be recompiled and can no longer run with Java SE 6. If you continue to use Java SE 6 on earlier fix packs after the end of support date, you could expose your environment to security risks.

Java SE 8 is the recommended Java SDK because it provides the latest features and security updates.

Known issues 
See Database changes for Java Batch in 18.0.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22014371]

There is a behavior change in java.util.zip.ZipFile.getEntry() from IBM SDK V8 SR4 FP10. With this release, the name of the ZipEntry instance returned from java.util.zip.ZipFile.getEntry() always ends with / for any zip directory entry. To revert to the previous behavior, set the system property jdk.util.zip.ensureTrailingSlash to "false". See here [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u144-relnotes-3838694.html?printOnly=1] for details. />
