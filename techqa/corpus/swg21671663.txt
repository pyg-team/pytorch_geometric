Title: IBM z/OS STAPs using port 16022 not registering to the Guardium collector appliance - United States

Text:
Active z/OS S-TAP no-data Inspection-core restart TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 STAP fails to show active on the Guardium appliance after starting it for the first time. 

SYMPTOM
- The z/OS STAP is properly configured to use port 16022.
- All messages on the mainframe indicate proper connectivity.
- The Guardium collector appliance appears to be functioning normally.
- Policy is correctly configured with a DB2 or IMS Collection Profile and installed.
- The mainframe S-TAPs still do not show up on the v9 collector appliance


CAUSE
If the collector has not been actively used as a collector since being built and configured, the sniffer appears to time-out the port 16022.

ENVIRONMENT
When running a v9.0 or v9.1 z/OS STAP against a NEW v9.0 or v9.1 appliance.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The z/OS STAP is properly configured and shows that the ASC, Policy and IFI agents have registered with the appliance but no traffic is monitored on the appliance and no S-TAPs show as active or inactive on the appliance.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restart the inspection-core from cli, using the following cli command:
restart inspection-core
