Title: IBM The login to the Rule Execution Server (RES) console is slow on a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) cluster and Federated Repository with LDAP - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logging in to the RES management console can be slow under the following conditions:
- The RES is part of a WAS cluster.
- A LDAP registry is used in a Federated repository.
- The user belongs to a large group (a few hundred people). 

CAUSE
The configureDSCluster script defines execution unit (XU) resources at the node level. The product documentation might also suggest defining the XU resource adapter at the node level.

When the user logs in to the RES console, the JVM node agent performs access control verification through LDAP. 

Because the node agent does not implement the LDAP DynaCache caching component, the LDAP server systematically retrieves all the user groups for verification.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Redefine the XU adapter and connection factories with either a server or a cluster scope. 


For suggestions on configuring the XU RAR with a server or cluster scope, see Step 7 of the ODM 8.5.1 Rule Execution Server configuration on WAS: Deploying the XU RAR [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.5.1/com.ibm.odm.zos.config/topics/tsk_ds_deploy_xu.html?lang=en].
