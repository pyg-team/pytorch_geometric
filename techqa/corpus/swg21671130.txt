CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: It is strongly encouraged that you take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

 * 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.13 
 * 7.1.3 through 7.1.3.10 
 * 7.1.4 through 7.1.4.3


Note: Versions earlier than 7.1.2 are not affected. REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply an interim fix for your appropriate release of RequisitePro:


 * 7.1.2.x: Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 13 (7.1.2.13) for 7.1.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037055] plus Interim fix 01 (7.1.2.13.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037391]
   
   
 * 7.1.3.x: Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 10 (7.1.3.10) for 7.1.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037054] plus Interim fix 01 (7.1.3.10.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037392]
   
   
 * 7.1.4.x: Install Rational RequisitePro Fix Pack 3 (7.1.4.3) for 7.1.4 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037053] plus Interim fix 01 for (7.1.4.03.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037393]




After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160: 

 

 1. Replace your SSL Certificates
    
    You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates for affected SSL connections. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (ie using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 
    
    
 2. Reset User Credentials
    
    Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.



Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable any customer-defined uses of ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl with SSL until you apply the fixes listed above.
