Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability - April 2014 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 

 

*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score. Customers can evaluate the impact of this vulnerability in their environments by accessing the links in the Reference section of this Security Bulletin.

After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160.


For Flex users only, replace your SSL certificates. After updating all nodes in the chassis, you need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates.
For information on replacing the SSL certificate see:
http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5095143 [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5095143] 

 

Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and force the user to re-authenticate. 

This includes: 

- All HMC user accounts configured for local authentication as well as those configured for Kerberos and LDAP authentication. 

- Flexible Service Processor (FSP) user accounts for all managed servers. 

- Any operating system user id or application password on a partition managed by the HMC when the partition is enabled for HMC remote virtual terminal (vterm) or remote 5250 console. 

For further information on managing HMC users and passwords see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/powersys/v3r1m5/topic/p7ha1/hmchmcmanagement-administration.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/powersys/v3r1m5/topic/p7ha1/hmchmcmanagement-administration.htm] 

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.
