QUESTION
 After changing the network interface setup on my servers, how can I force RSCT to update its list of known network interfaces ? 

ANSWER
RSCT automatically harvests all interfaces of the nodes in a cluster. It does periodic re-harvesting as well.
You can manually initiate a harvest operation by running the following command :

refrsrc IBM.NetworkInterface

Check the output of the following to see if the list of network interfaces that RSCT knows about matches what you expect :

lsrsrc -Ab IBM.NetworkInterface
