APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The 'packet-capture-advanced' command might fail when the
   following conditions are met:
   1. Running firmware version 7.5.2+
   2. The 'master-key' argument is provided
   3. Enforce RBM on CLI is enabled
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are a couple ways to workaround this issue:
   1. Disable Enforce RBM on CLI
   2. Collect packet capture using WebGUI
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When Enforce RBM on CLI is on AND the last argument master-key
   on/off is set in the packet capture command, it will fail
   schema validation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.5.2.8 and 7.6.0.0
