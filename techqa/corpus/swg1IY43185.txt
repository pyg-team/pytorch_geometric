ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I tested this on both HTTP and HTTPS to rule out SSL caching
   also on both UNIX and WIn32 platform and both PD 3.8 with
   eUpdate9 and AM 3.9 problem occurs same everywhere
   .
   to recreate
   .
   set forms login for both http and https
   connect to the WebSEAL and login with a username, but user
   incorrect password, %ERROR% will show Login failed. You have
   used an invalid username, password or client certificate
   now rerequest the same page (dotn refresh browser, but retype
   URL) and %ERROR% will still show the error above. Once again,
   rerequest the above URL, this time %ERROR% is empty.
   It should be empty on the first request, I ran a header trace to
   the WebSEAL and also verify in the request.log that the 2nd
   request is going to the WebSEAL and not coming from the browser
   cache, then for some reason on the 3rd request we clear the
   %ERROR%. The customer is customizing the login page with
   javascript to redirect based on the %ERROR%, but is someone is
   redirected, then comes directly back, they are redirected again
   when they shouldn't be
