   ****************************************************************
   When using the CICS Explorer connected to a CPSM WUI server with
   a CICS Management Interface connection, clicking the
   Explorer->Signoff menu item causes a null password to be sent to
   the server. An error is shown in the MSGLOG on the CPSM server.
   
   The error is intermittent and caused by the user password being
   deleted from local storage on a different thread, before the
   connection to the WUI server is discarded.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CICS Explorer core UI plugin has been modified so that the
   deletion of the password from local storage is now performed on
   the same thread as the job which disconnects the Explorer from
   the CPSM WUI server.
   
   The CICS Explorer can be updated via one of two possible means:
   
   1. Update the CICS Explorer from within the CICS Explorer using
   the IBM-hosted Update-Site.
   2. Download the update from Fix Central to be installed locally
   into the CICS Explorer.
   
   Updating using the Update-Site
   
   * Start CICS Explorer.
   * Select Help -> Software Updates... from the main menu.
   * Click the Installed Software tab and click Update...
   * An update should be found for the CICS Explorer, verify that
   the update version is 1.0.1.2_201105161706 or higher.
   * Click Finish to install the update.
   * Once the update has completed you'll be prompted to restart
   the CICS Explorer for the update to take effect. Click Yes.
   * Optionally, verify that the CICS Explorer version has been
   updated:
     * Select Help -> About IBM CICS Explorer from the main menu
   and note the version, it should be 1.0.1.2 or higher.
   
   The CICS Explorer is now up-to-date with this update installed,
   and no further action is necessary.
   
   If no update was found using the above steps, verify that the
   version of the CICS Explorer is prior to 1.0.1.
   
   To do this select Help -> About IBM CICS Explorer from the main
   menu and note the version currently installed.
   
   If the version is lower than 1.0.1.2 and no update was found,

   is by default):

     (concatenate the URL above).
   * If the entry is not there, or incorrect, delete the existing
   entry, and click Add Site... and add the url above into the text
   box and click OK.
