ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   ITM 6.1 FP3 or FP4 (reproduced on both FP3 and FP4)
   AIX Hub TEMS, TEPS, and UNIX OS Agent, with TEP
   Browser client on Windows XP (problem likely occurs generically)
   
   Problem Description:
   
   Correlated situations cannot be associated with navigator items
   in custom Navigator Views.  They can be associated with
   navigator items in the Physical Navigator View fine.
   
   Recreation Procedure:
   
   --In the TEP, create two situations and associate them if
   necessary, and confirm they become true and appear on the
   Physical Navigator and the Situation Event Console.  For this
   example, I created situations "unix_test1" and "unix_test2" that
   checked disk space on a UNIX OS Agent was less
   than 100% (i.e. it would always be True for both); I confirmed
   both situations appeared Open on the Situation Event Console,
   and updated the Physical Navigator on the appropriate navigator
   item.
   
   --Open the navigator editor window; create a custom Navigator
   View (mine was named CustomNavigatorView).
   
   --Click once on the new CustomNavigatorView item to select it;
   then right-click it and choose "Properties" to view properties.
   In the "Navigator View Properties" window that appears, select
   the "*HUB" Managed System List so it is assigned, and click OK
   (NOTE: we were hoping this would help it be allowed to associate
   the correlated situation with a navigator item in the Custom
   Navigator, but later you'll see this does not help).
   
   --Drag-and-drop an item from the Physical navigator over to the
   CustomNavigatorView.  For mine, I just dragged-and-dropped a
   particular hostname "bootcamp"; it had a Universal Agent and a
   UNIX OS Agent under it at the time, so it adds that hostname and
   those two Agents under it when it builds the new
   CustomNavigatorView.  Save/Close it.
   
   --Switch from the Physical Navigator View to the
   "CustomNavigatorView" Navigator View that was just created.
   
   --Expand the new host and expand the Agent to confirm it's OK so
   far. In my case, I expanded the UNIX OS Agent just to be sure it
   was OK; I'll continue to use that as an example in the following
   steps.
   
   --Right-click the "UNIX OS" navigator item and choose
   "Situations..." to launch the Situation Editor.
   
   --Create a new situation: I named it "sit_90693_corr_test1" and
   checked the box for "Correlate Situations across Managed
   Systems" so we could do a correlated Situation.
   
   --In the "Available Situations" window, select the first
   situation (unix_test1 was used above) and the Agent that was
   used earlier that you know already have True/Open status on it,
   and say OK.
   
   --Do "Add Conditions..." to add the second situation
   (unix_test2) and the Agent, and say OK.
   
   --Back in the correlated situation formula, click in the cells
   to add the "True" entry for both (i.e. Situation is true).
   Click OK to save it.
   
   --Confirm the correlated situation has become true using any
   method you wish (view the "Universal Message Console" for
   example; or view the Situation Event Console; or view the logs).
   Confirm you can see it become True in the Physical Navigator as
   well.
   
   --Back in the CustomNavigatorView Navigator View, right click
   the top-entry "CustomNavigatorView" and choose "Situations".
   
   --Choose the "Set situation filter criteria..." icon and change
   it so that you can view situations "eligible for association".
   The correlated situation sit_90693_corr_test1 should appear
   under the "Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server" item.
   
   --Right-click that correlated situation and you'll see the
   problem: there is not an option to Associate it with this
   navigator item.
   
   Modifying the custom navigator properties to add additional
   "Assigned" Agents or MSLs does not help; it never seems to allow
   associating the Correlated Situation with an item in the custom
   navigator view.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable to associate correlated situation to a user defined
   navigator item.
   Associating
   correlated situations to user defined
   navigator items was not working even if the
   *HUB or hubname was assigned to
   the user defined navigator item.Internally the
   navigator item was not getting the
   context for the hub tems. We also
   had to allow for the hub name to be assigned
   to the navigator items along with
   *HUB.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code was added to the tep client to add context to the navgator
   item when *HUB or the hub name was assigned to the navigator
   properties.
