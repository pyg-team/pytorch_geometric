Title: IBM Tips when using Conditional Formulas and Conditional Formatting with IBM Cognos Disclosure Management - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Many Cognos Disclosure Management users like to build both conditional formatting and conditional formulas into their reports as part analyzing and reporting the financial data for management. The issue is can be how Cognos Disclosure Management refreshes the reporting objects when conditional formatting and formulas are includined in the report objects. 

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Examples of conditional Formulas 

1. Sumif 

2. Countif 

3. Vlookup 

4. Hlookup 

5. IF or else statements 

 

Hint: Cognos Disclosure End-Users should refer to Microsoft Excel user guide that will guide how to create the formulas within Microsoft Excel. This document will not describe how to create the formulas, but how to maximize their use within Cognos Disclosure Management. 

 

Overview - Cognos Disclosure Management refresh process for Report Objects 

IBM Cognos Disclosure Management refreshing data via the following ways: 

 1. Data Query (Data Source) – please refer to the user guide for more information on how the query (Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.2>Analyze and Create>Cognos Disclosure Management User Guide 10.2.2>Report objects>Working with Excel objects>Data retrieval and adjustment>Client-side Microsoft Excel add-ins) 
 2. Checking in/out of the report – please refer to the user guide for more information on how to check in/out reporting objects (Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.4>Analyze and Create>Cognos Disclosure Management User Guide 10.2.4>Report objects>Tasks for report objects>Report object properties)


Tips/Conditional Formulas 

 1. Cognos Disclosure Management Users may want to review various formulas that are conditional to ensure they are up-to-date as part of the month-end reporting or quarterly/year-end regulatory filings for companies. Users may want to highlight the formula and then do a refresh to ensure the formula calculates the proper results before the generation of the report. 
 2. CDM is designed to handle formula, but is important to understand what formulas are being used as part of various report objects. Formulas that are array type may require CDM end-users to refresh the reporting object on a more regular basis. CDM end-users should refer to the Microsoft customer support site that discusses “array formulas”, i.e. Guidelines-and-examples-of-array-formulas 
 3. Lookup and reference formulas are used as part of comparing values with a report as way to return a value. CDM users should review the “Lookup” formulas to ensure they are referencing the right data within the report object. Hint: there is a document that illustrates how CDM users can used vlookup to change color as part of conditional formatting - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969334 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969334] . This document provides a good example as it includes ##D and ##S variables as part of building logical statement for a report object or http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969231 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969231]. This document discusses the holding of values as part of building reports using Cognos Disclosure Management


Examples of Conditional Formatting: Microsoft Excel allows for formatting rules to cells. Figure 1 shows the rules that are available as part of configuring formatting rule as part of a reporting object. CDM users should refer to the Microsoft Support site on how define the formatting rule for the data range.

Tips/Conditional Formatting 

 * CDM users made have to review the rules including table/coloring as part of the rule creation. The tables may have to include rules for both the coloring and the bordering. Example #1 shows a basic table that is looking at variance analysis with "Green Coloring" representing unfavourable balance and the "Red Coloring" representing the favorable balance. This table including conditional coloring as well as information is in table structure. Users can see the option for the format including the color as well "font" or "Border" or "Fill". It is good practice to review all aspect of the rules to ensure they are display correctly as part of the generation process for Cognos Disclosure Management.
