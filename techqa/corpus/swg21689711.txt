Title: IBM Can not detect partner's heart beat. - United States

Text:
FELB; heart beat TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Even though both primary front end load balancer (FELB) and backup FELB are running, they are not able to detect partner's heart beat.



SYMPTOM
If you use different ports for "remote port" in High Availability tab like describing below, both primary and backup can not detect partner's heart beat.


CAUSE
 

"Remote Port" in High Availability tab on both primary and backup need to be the same.

For example, this configuration is NG:
FELB primary: First reserved port = 3061, Remote port = 3062
FELB backup: First reserved port = 3062, Remote port = 3061 

And this configuration is OK:
FELB primary: First reserved port = 3065, Remote port = 3070
FELB backup: First reserved port = 3080, Remote port = 3070 

You can use the same ports for both first reserved port and remote port like this:
FELB primary: First reserved port = 3060, Remote port = 3060
FELB backup: First reserved port = 3060, Remote port = 3060 



ENVIRONMENT
Front End Load Balancer for ISAM8 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please use the same port number for "Remote Port" on both primary FELB and backup FELB.
