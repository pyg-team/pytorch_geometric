PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Tivoli Directory Server provided InstallShield GUI fails to launch in graphical mode. 

SYMPTOM
The following output is seen when the installer is launched: 

# ./install_tds.bin
Initializing Wizard........
Launching InstallShield Wizard........
...
The uninstaller is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the uninstaller with the -console or -silent flag.


CAUSE
InstallShield installer provided with IBM Tivoli Directory Server V6.1, V6.2 and V6.3 uses Java 1.5 to launch the GUI installer. This requires the libstdc++.so.5 to be present on the system. 
For RHEL 5 or 6 (RedHat Enterprise Linux) system this lib is provided by compat-libstdc++-33


ENVIRONMENT
Linux enterprise operating systems - RHEL 5.x, 6.x



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the following rpms from the RHEL 5.x or 6.x OS CD / DVDs: 


RHEL 5.x:
compat-libstdc++-33 both 32 bit and 64 bit rpms:
compat-libstdc++-33-*.i386.rpm
compat-libstdc++-33-*.x86_64.rpm

Similarly install:
libXp-*.i386.rpm
libXp-*.x86_64.rpm

Also make sure the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly pointing to a working X environment. Verify by testing with xclock command.
