ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAMESSO agent: SAP administrators desktops hang every 3-4
   days Desktop computers used by SAP Administrators (that use more
   than 6
   SAPGUI windows opened in the same time and probably they leave
   them
   opened for a long time)  hangs up every 3-4 days.
   When this event happens, they need to stop the desktop
   unplugging the
   AC power supply because it is not possible to reboot.
   The operating system is hung.
   They switched off the agent and the problem disappeared, so the
   problem
   seems related to the TAMESSO agent and SAP profile.
   Everyday the customer reboot the systems where the problem
   arises with
   the agent on.
   So, it is not related to a leak problem I think.
   
   Normal sap users does not open 20/25 saplogon windows ... so
   they
   haven't the problem
   Steps to Duplicate:
   See Problem Description -  after 3 or 4 days ... it is randomly
   reproduced.
   
   
   Desired Behavior:
   This should not happen and TAM E-SSO needs to handle Multiple
   SAP
   windows
