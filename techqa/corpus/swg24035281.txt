 IBM ILOG ODME Optimization Solutions Accelerator Fix Pack V3.7.0.1 on Fix Central 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM ILOG ODME Optimization Solutions Accelerator provides components that allow the execution and customization of IBM Industry Optimization Solutions developed with IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise V3.7.0.1. IBM ILOG ODME Optimization Solutions Accelerator consists of two editions: the "Client Edition" and the "Server Edition." 

IBM ILOG ODME Optimization Solutions Accelerator Client Edition V3.7.0.1 consists of the following components:

1. Advanced Interactive Gantt

This Visualization component provides an abstract ODM custom Gantt
view that greatly reduces the effort required to build interactive
scheduling applications. This component extends the Gantt component
provided by ODM Enterprise to add some features not found in the ODM
Enterprise Gantt component. This component is built using IBM ILOG
JViews Gantt delivered with ODM Enterprise V3.7 and can be extended
using the APIs from the Solutions Accelerator and JViews.

2. ODM View Utilities

This component provides a set of utilities to support the execution
of custom views provided in the IBM Industry Optimization Solutions,
particularly filtered aggregated Chart Views.

3. Data Exchange

This component provides the capability to define and orchestrate
advanced data import/export jobs between ODM and external
components. It requires IBM DB2 V9 or V10 (including IBM DB2
Express-C V9 or V10).

4. SPSS Modeler Connector

This component provides the capability to execute ODM Enterprise
custom tasks based on SPSS Modeler Streams. The component requires
IBM SPSS Modeler Client 14.2 or later or IBM SPSS Modeler Server
14.2 and IBM SPSS Modeler Batch 14.2, or later versions.

5. Support for Microsoft Excel Scenario Source

This component provides the capability to load Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets into an ODM Enterprise Scenario or to export ODM
Enterprise Scenario tables to Microsoft Excel. The component uses a
structural pattern based on the ODM Data Table Schema to load or
export the Excel data.

This component requires Apache POI version 3.9, which can be
downloaded here: http://poi.apache.org/download.html [http://poi.apache.org/download.html]
