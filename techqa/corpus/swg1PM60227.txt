APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It may be observed that XML output generated from the map is
   missing namespaces on some elements and not on others.
   Adding the missing namespaces manually to an output card
   generates the expected output. But using the reload function
   to add all the namespace entries automatically to the output
   card properties eventually causes a crash of the Design Studio.

   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender Design Studio users
   
   Problem Description:
   Design Studio crashes randomly when the input/output card uses
   XML Namespace pairs that exceed the maximum allowed limit of
   5120 bytes when opening/saving the map and running the map.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed a problem with Design Studio where it does not crash when
   the XML Namespace pairs exceed the maximum allowed limit of 5120
   bytes and instead shows an error message to the user.
