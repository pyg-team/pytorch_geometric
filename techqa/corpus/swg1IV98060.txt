ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:Ã˜
   Client is unable to use scheduler gantt view consistently.
   
   When attempting to use the Gant View from Graphical Scheduler
   application the left side window which displays work, tasks, and
   description will freeze up. When it freezes it will not move
   with the schedule right side section. It will not allow you to
   scroll or select items from the window.

   I cannot reproduce it.   It seems to happen on certain
   environments with certain configurations.    But we have an
   update from Treegrid that has helped in these situation that we
   now want to get added to the Interim Fix.
   
   Steps to Reproduce sent by the client:
   1. Login to Maximo
   2. From GoTo choose Planning and Scheduling > Graphical
   Scheduler
   3. Search for and select a Schedule in list view
   4. Choose the Gantt View Tab
   5. Attempt to navigate in Gantt View Window
   (See attached Recording- .mp4 file
   I will attach the recording and the .png file in RTC when the
   APAR is transferred there.)
