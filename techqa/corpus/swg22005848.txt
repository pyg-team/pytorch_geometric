CAUSE
There are other possible causes for this error. 

 * See separate IBM Technotes for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is that the Oracle client has been incorrectly installed/configured on the Controller application server. 

 

Example: 

In one real-life example, the customer had installed the Oracle 11G client incorrectly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reconfigure the Oracle client on the Controller application server. 

 

Example: 

In one real-life customer example, the solution was: 

1. Logon to Controller application server as a Windows administrator 

2. Uninstall Oracle 11G 32-bit client 

3. Uninstall Oracle 11G 64-bit client 

4. Remove the Windows system variable 'ORACLE_HOME' 

5. Edit the system variable 'PATH' to remove the references to Oracle 

6. Reboot the Controller application server 

7. Install Oracle 12C (both 64-bit and 32-bit) onto the Controller application server 

 * For precise instructions, see separate IBM Technote #2005849.
