PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Datacap Rulerunner server is unable to connect to the Datacap Taskmaster server when communicating through an F5 Load Balancer.

The Rulerunner thread logs show - Establish Connection Failure. 

SYMPTOM
A network trace will show multiple name query NBSTAT *<00><00><00><00><00><00><00> requests being broadcast from the Taskmaster server.


CAUSE
The Taskmaster service cannot resolve the IP address it is receiving from the load balancer through a regular NSLookup request. When that occurs, it sends out an NBSTAT (Reverse DNS) request to identify the device. Some administrators block that request for security reasons preventing IP name resolution from occurring.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two ways to resolve this issue:


 * Edit the hosts file on the Taskmaster server with the IP and host name of the load balancer. The hosts file is at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc 
 * Add the load balancer to the domain so that DNS can resolve the domain name.
