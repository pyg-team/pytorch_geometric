REMEDIATION/FIXES
FastBack for Workstations CAC 7.1

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990056 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990056]
Click on the link for Liberty interim fix pack PI67093. Click the FC (Fix Central) download link for 8559-wlp-archive-IFPI67093. Once downloaded, there will be a Readme.txt file and the 8559-wlp-archive-IFPI67093.jar file.

To apply the interim fix, do the following:|


 1. Stop the TSM FastBack for Workstations Central Administration Console service (CAC_Service) 
 2. Open an elevated command window and direct it to the location of the iFix jar 
 3. Run the command: java -jar 8559-wlp-archive-IFPI62375.jar --installLocation "C:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\CAC\wlp" (Default install location shown)
    
    The following launch options are available for the jar:
    
    --installLocation [LibertyRootDir] by default the jar will look for a "wlp" directory in its current location. If your Liberty profile install location is different than "wlp" and/or is not in the same directory as the jar then you can use this option to change where the jar will patch. [LibertyRootDir] can either be relative to the location of the jar or an absolute file path.
    
    --suppressInfo hides all messages other than confirming the patch has completed or error messages.
    
 4. Start TSM FastBack for Workstations Central Administration Console service (CAC_Service) and the fix will become active in your runtime environment.
