PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli Information Management for    *
   *                 z/OS users and applications which use any of *
   *                 the Infoman Application Programming          *
   *                 interfaces.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Abend S0C4 AB/S0C4, abend S878 AB/S878  *
   *                      and abend S80A ABS/S80A in module       *
   *                      BLXSSERV.BLXSCSMR occur after PTF       *
   *                      UA63943 is applied.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF and restart the BLX-SP address *
   *                 space and all applications which access an   *
   *                 Infoman database.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   After applying PTF UA63943, APAR OA38453 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1OA38453] which corrects a memory
   leak issue, intermittent abend S0C4, S878 and S80A abends in
   module BLXSSERV.BLXSCSMR occur. Dump analysis revealed that
   module BLXSCSMR was freeing storage before it obtained a pointer
   from that storage and that module BLXSTERM used the wrong length
   value when attempting to free CINX blocks.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module BLXSCSMR has been modified so that it correctly maintains
   the list of SCQE blocks.  This modification avoids attempts to
   access storage pages that have been freed by z/OS.
   
   Module BLXSTERM was modified to use the correct length when
   freeing CINX blocks.  This modification eliminates the S878 and
   S80A abends caused bythe accumulation of partially freed CINX
   blocks.
