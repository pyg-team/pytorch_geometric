 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Cube Designer 11.0.7 and Oracle 11g R2 Data source, after generating Dimension using data Sampling, the data type of the Member is shown Unknown. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To replicate this issue, I have used GOSALESDW Schema provided in IBM Cognos Samples 11.0.7. 

1. Open Cube designer-->select "Create new from Metadata"-->select the data source and select GOSLAESDW schema. 
2. Under Tables-->right click on FIN_SUBM_DIM-->Generate "Dimension using data Sampling" as shown in below.

3. The data type of the Member : "Submission_Name_EN" is shown as "Unknown".
4. Verify the JDBC driver being used, you may be using drivers like ojdbc5.jar / ojdbc6.jar / ojdbc7.jar .


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Stop Cognos services. 

2. Place ojdbc8.jar in <cognos instal dir>/drivers/ location. 

3. Start Cognos services. 

4. Recreate the data source connection(of type JDBC) to Oracle DB. 

5. Open Cube designer and re-test. Now, the Data type will be show correctly. 

 

Note: Please refer related URLs section to see the document containing detailed table on the supportability of JDBC driver version with Oracle DB versions.
