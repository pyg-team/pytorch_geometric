APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the P8 451 InfoCenter docs in section:
   
   Install additional IBM FileNet P8 products > IBM FileNet Content
   Federation Services for Image Services, Version 4.5.1+ > Content
   Engine server > Create an object store > Create a fixed content
   device in EM
   
   Documentation states:
   IS Organization: This should be your company name, such as
   yourco, bigcorp, and so on.
   
   The above statement can be misleading for customers and cause
   them to enter the incorrect information.  In most cases it will
   be FileNet.
   
   Customers comments:
   "IS Organization should be FileNet unless you paid Xerox to
   change it."
   
   That area of the documentation should be changed to be more
   consistent with other areas of the documentation:
   
   IBM FileNet P8 documentation > System Administration > Content
   Engine Administration > FileNet P8 domain > How to... > View and
   modify FileNet P8 domain properties
   Fixed Content Devices properties (General tab) > IBM FileNet
   Image Services configuration parameters
   
   IS Organization:
   "In most cases, this value is "FileNet." This value is stored as
   another part of the Service name configuration parameter in the
   fixed content device. Enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.
   
   The <organization> portion of a two- or three-part NCH name of
   the associated Image Management System (IMS). NCH names are
   case-sensitive. NCH three-part names use the form:
   <object>:<domain>:<organization>. The object name must be 1 to
   40 bytes (bytes, not characters). If present, it always has the
   value of DefaultIMS. The organization name must be 1 to 20
   bytes."

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For the past several releases, we have recommended that clients
   
   use their own company name, rather than FileNet, for the
   
   organization portion of the three-part NCH name in the form:
   <object>:<domain>:<organization>.  To paraphrase Alan Babich,
   
   STSM, Image Manager Architect, "Companies should not use
   
   FileNet as the organization name in order  to prevent great
   inconvenience when companies that use Image Services are merged
   or want to collaborate with other companies that use Image
   Services."
   
   
   Dr. Babich also mentions that Xerox no longer registers
   organization names for XNS. However, the alternative of
   
   registering the organization name with the American National
   Standards Institute (ANSI)  is a great alternative.
   <http://www.ansi.org/other_services/registration_programs/reg_or
   g.aspx >
   
   "The organization name is case sensitive, and must not exceed
   
   20 characters total, including embedded spaces, if any.  ANSI
   
   requires that the name be alphanumeric -- letters and numbers
   only, and I think embedded spaces are allowed. ...
   
   
   "There is the additional benefit that their registered
   
   organization name will also be unique on planet earth in the
   LDAP naming hierarchy. (Actually, that's why ANSI is
   
   registering organization names. ... ) That's a strong selling
   point, because most customers are using LDAP nowadays."
   
   
   Therefore, to be consistent, we're going to leave the
   
   following topic as-is: Install additional IBM FileNet P8
   products > IBM FileNet Content Federation Services for Image
   Services, Version 4.5.1+ > Content Engine server > Create an
   
   object store > Create a fixed content device in EM
   
   Documentation states:
   IS Organization: This should be your company name, such as
   
   yourco, bigcorp, and so on.
   
   
   But we will change the topic: IBM FileNet P8 documentation >
   System Administration > Content Engine Administration > FileNet
   P8 domain > How to... > View and modify FileNet P8 domain
   properties
   Fixed Content Devices properties (General tab) > IBM FileNet
   Image Services configuration parameters
   
   OLD:
   IS Organization:
   "In most cases, this value is "FileNet." This value is
   
   stored as another part of the Service name configuration
   parameter in the fixed content device. Enter up to 20
   alphanumeric characters.
   
   NEW:
   IS Organization:
   "In some cases, this value is "FileNet." However, in many
   
   cases this value is your company name, such as yourco,
   
   bigcorp, and so on. This value is stored as another part of the
   
   Service name configuration parameter in the fixed content
   device. Enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.
