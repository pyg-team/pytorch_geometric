APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When unconfiguring the Data Collector, the
   WasConfiguredServers.xml file does not get cleaned up.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Unconfigure the DC (if you have not done so already).
   
   
   2. Back up
      <DC_HOME>/installer/configured/WasConfiguredServers.xml
   
   3. Look at the contents of
      <DC_HOME>/installer/configured/WasConfiguredServers.xml and
      see if there is an entry in it for your AppServer. If there
      is, it has to be removed.
   
      Note: If, after unconfiguring this DC, you have no configured
      DCs for ITCAM for AD, you can replace the contents of the
      WasConfiguredServers.xml file with the following:
   
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <vendors>
            <vendor serverType="was">
              <nodeDefine>
                <subnode>$(xxx)</subnode>
              </nodeDefine>
            </vendor>
         </vendors>
   
   4. Try to configure one more time (selecting TEP and MS Admin
   Console
      Console interfaces) and to restart the JVM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After the Data Collector is unconfigured manually for an
   application server instance, it may fail to configure for the
   same instance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  One of the reasons could be due to wrong entries in
   WasConfiguredServers.xml.  Try the steps listed in the following
   technote to check whether it resolves the issue:
