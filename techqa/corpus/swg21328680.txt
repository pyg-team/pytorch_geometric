MQ file size; 0x0133000e; message too large; Reason Code 2010 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Event Code 0x0133000e - Could not send, message is too large (MQ Reason Code 2010) Level:error 
The destination could not accept the message. (MQ Reason Code 2010) 

SYMPTOM
The default message size of the MQ QM Object is 4MB. If a message whose size is greater than 4MB is PUT by DataPower's MQ front side handler or back-end destination queue, DataPower will throw MQ Reason Code 2010 in the system log. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are configuration changes necessary (1) MQ QM Object's maximum message size (2) if the request type is XML and SOAP, the associated XML manager's bytes scanned attribute. used in the Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) service. 

To correct this issue do the following:


 1. Navigate to the Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) from the Control Panel
    
 2. Select the MQ Front side handler configured
    
 3. Navigate to the Queue Manager configured 
    
 4. Set the Maximum Message Size to the estimated size of the incoming message



To be able to send a large file through the DataPower appliance, make sure that the XML Manager used by the MQ Manager Object and the MPGW service are set to handle the large message size. 
 1. Navigate to the MPGW Service you have configured to receive a large file (100 MB file, for example) as request 
    
 2. Press the "..." for the XML manager used 
    
 3. Select the "XML Parser" tab
    
 4. Modify the value "XML Bytes Scanned" from "4194304" which is the default to "104857600" or any value greater that the size of your message.

NOTE: Make sure the MQ Server' queue can accept the size of the message being PUT by the Frontside handler of DataPower and its associated XML manager. Consult with your MQ Server administrator on how to modify the MQ Queue Manager, Channel and the designated Queue to set the size appropriately
