PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In addition to the code change and attempting other, already
   documented,  means for avoiding resource issues while running
   member fixer, the customer can set the following properties in
   the WCM WCMConfigService REP in their WAS admin console:
   
    deployment.maxJCRSessionOps = 200
    iterator.pagesize = 200
   
   The customer may need to try to adjust some of the different
   settings
   above in order to see if they can find a setting that will avoid
   the OOM
   issue (e.g., increasing or decreasing the maxJCRSessionOps or
   pagesize).
   
   NOTE:  This change is specific to v800x only because
   enhancements already made in the JCR starting in v8.5 prevent
   this being an issue going forward.
   
   A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 17 (PI38621 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI38621]) for Portal
