Title: IBM Cala client starts but does not send any monitor events - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Cala client starts but does not send any monitor events. It can be verified that none of the monitors are running by not only checking the web console, but by also creating the .plusdebug directory to enable monitor debugging. There will be no debug files (.sh files) created in .plusdebug, confirming that Cala client is not executing any of the monitors. 

SYMPTOM
Cala client will start, but the cala process will not do anything. It will constantly and steadily use CPU, but no monitoring will occur. Also, attempting to stop Cala client the proper way will also probably not work (Services in Windows, and the "<FSM install>/cala/cala.sh stop" command in Unix/Linux). The cala process has to be killed.


CAUSE
The *.at files in the cala directory contain inaccurate process information. These files are used to keep track of what Cala processes are up. If Cala was terminated abnormally (i.e. the service was not stopped properly in Windows, or the cala.sh stop script was not used), these *.at files can be incorrect.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, kill Cala if it is not already down. You will have to kill the cala_srv process manually. Delete the <ECM SM install>/cala/*.at files. Start Cala the normal way.
