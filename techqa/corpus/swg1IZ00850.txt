ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario as described by customer:
   
   On Sundays we have a scheduled DB bounce (for backup purpose) on
   TEST1
   Settings were observed to be reset on Monday. Infrastructure
   guys told
   me that they did not bounce the dataloader, hence I assume that
   the
   reset happened after DB bounce.
   I observed similar behavior when i bounced the dataloader
   processes
   manually - pvmdmgr stop/start.
   Also reset didn't happen when i killed and started the CMGR
   process..
   Hence this issue is observe for sure after DL process restart
   DB restart is the activity I can gurantee. I am not sure if
   somehow DL
   also got restarted (which in turn led to settings getting reset)
   as
   we/Infrastructure have no clue of it.
   Let me know in case of any other details
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround provided
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This is an original implementation bug.  The collector code was
   implemented to accomodate incorrect data insertion in the DB by
   a non-collector component.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Reimplemented the collector code according to the original
   design and issue appropriate SQL statements to fixup the DB.
   Future releases and fixes of the collector will require this fix
   in all environments in order to correct the existing
   DB tables.
