APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The function is working as designed and the confusion is due to
   the ambiguity of the date 000229:
   For the customer this date is 2000-02-29, but for DataStage this
   date parsed with the %yy%mm%dd format is 1900-02-29 which is
   not a leap year.
   Years at the end of the century (00) are in general not a leap
   year except every 400 years: 1900 is not a leap year, 2000 is
   one, 2100 is not one, etc... 2400 is the next one.

                APAR Recommendation:
   87 upgrade to fp2  and  below apply patch to have  complete fix
   for  JR43459

   r/87FP2_HotFix/patch_JR43459_IAServer_8702.zip
   
   87fp2 has fix  for APAR JR43459  with  a regression hence  needs
   to apply above
   91 has the fix
   
   
   APAR Problem Conclusion:
   APAR JR43459  is created  and fix is done such that  user can
   specify the date format with is_date operator to test in any
   date value  and  this fix is available in 87fp2
   Though 87fp2  has fix  for APAR JR43459  and  regression
   introduced  need to apply  below patch  on  top 87fp2

LOCAL FIX
 *  A work around would be to change the rule into: '20'+col is_date
   to remove the ambiguity: instead of '000229' the value
   '20000229' would be tested which is clearly mapped to the right
   year.
   
   Fix provided in rollup_RU5_IA_ALL_8701, rollup_RU6_IA_ALL_8701
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The isDate test of data rules checks if a value matches any of
   many possible date format and doesn't let the user specify the
   date format to check, which leads in some cases to wrong results
   regarding what the user is trying to test.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  APAR JR43459  is created  and fix is done such that  user can
   specify the date format with is_date operator to test in any
   date value  and  this fix is available in 87fp2
   Though 87fp2  has fix  for APAR JR43459  and  regression
   introduced  need to apply  below patch  on  top 87fp2
