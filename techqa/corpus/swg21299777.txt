PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are experiencing an Execution Group problem with WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) on UNIXes or Linux. 

This mustgather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support.


ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris systems.
Return to the WebSphere Message Broker MustGather index [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Consider Using the Test Client in trace and debug mode [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/af52260_.htm].
 2. 
 3. A user level trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg21177321#1] is intended to assist users with understanding how their ESQL is processed.
    It will also show a high level view of the message flow behavior.
 4. 
 5. Check for known issues:

STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. mqsidc
    See: mqsidc usage instructions [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fbu46012_.htm]
     * Always gather broker-specific data when possible using the Broker Collector.
     * The mqsidc tool is only available for WMB 7.0.0.5+, WMB 8.0.0.1+, and IIB 9.0.
    
    
 2. 
 3. 
 4. General Broker information If the mqsidc tool was not run, then capture this information manually
    
     * Record the WebSphere Message Broker version, release, and maintenance level.
       This can be captured using the command 'mqsiservice -v'..
     * Record the operating system version, release, and maintenance level.
     * Record the version, release, and maintenance level of any related products and components for the problematic application.
     * Collect the local error log. On UNIX and Linux systems, the local error log is the syslog. The location of your syslog is configured in the syslog daemon.
       See: Configuring the syslog daemon [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an04230_.htm]
     * Collect the Standard Output/Error logs.
       WMB writes information to both stdout and stderr files. These files are located under the Message Broker workpath.
       See: Standard System Logs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fau14165_.htm]

 8. Select the point of failure:  * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299777&amp;aid=1] Failures 
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299777&amp;aid=2] Abends
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299777&amp;aid=3] Startup
       [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299777&amp;aid=4] Creation
       
       Failures 
     *  Execution Group service trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&context=SSKM8N&context=SS3GH2&context=SSKMAB&q1=service+trace&uid=swg21177321&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Abends
     *  Abend file
       Abend files are recorded in the syslog.
       However, the abend details will be written to a new file, and the syslog entry will tell you the file name.
       The new file is called: filename.abend and is written to the /var/mqsi/common/errors directory. Execution Group service trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&context=SSKM8N&context=SS3GH2&context=SSKMAB&q1=service+trace&uid=swg21177321&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en]

ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 



STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
