ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Domino server contains both a Web Service Consumer and a Web
   Service
   Provider, in separate databases.  The agent containing the Web
   Service
   Consumer code accesses the Provider over SSL (via an https:// [https://]
   endpoint).
   When the agent is invoked via a web browser (using a ?OpenAgent
   URL), following
   error is thrown:
   
   HTTP JVM: Error connecting to 'server' on port '443', SSL
   invalid certificate,
   may need to cross-certify.
   
   However, the error is not thrown if any of these cases is
   true:
   - The consumer and provider are on different servers.
   - The consumer accesses the provider over an http:// endpoint
   (not SSL) instead.
   - The consumer agent is not invoked via a URL.  (Via a 'tell
   amgr run' command,
   instead, for example)
