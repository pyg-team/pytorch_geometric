APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) deployment environment
   was created with property
   bpm.de.node.#.clusterMember.#.jvmSettings.#.jvmArgs set in the
   configuration properties file, you receive the following error
   while the application server starts:
   
    "CWWIM0006E  Initialization of component, ConfigManager,
   failed:
   java.lang.NullPointerException"
   
   This issue occurs because the required "eclipse.bundle.setTCCL"
   generic JVM property is missing. Usually, this JVM property is
   set while configuring the IBM BPM deployment environment, but if
   bpm.de.node.#.clusterMember.#.jvmSettings.#.jvmArgs is also
   specified in the input configuration properties file
   eclipse.bundle.setTCCL (and other generic JVM settings) are
   overwritten.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When bpm.de.node.#.clusterMember.#.jvmSettings.#.jvmArgs
   properties are set in the input configuration properties file
   for the BPMConfig command, they are set exactly as specified as
   the generic JVM properties for the corresponding server instead
   of being added to IBM BPM's default generic JVM properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 that allows the
   BPMConfig -create command to add the
   bpm.de.node.#.clusterMember.#.jvmSettings.#.jvmArgs properties
   to IBM BPM's default generic JVM properties instead of replacing
    them.
   
   On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
   for JR53620:
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
   the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
   level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR53620, and click Continue.
   
   When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
   the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
   additional installation instructions and information about the
   fix.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Before you run the BPMConfig -create command, remove all
   bpm.de.node.#.clusterMember.#.jvmSettings.#.jvmArgs properties
   from the input configuration properties file. When the
   deployment environment has been created, use the administrative
   console to manually add these JVM generic properties as
   described in the following procedure.
   
   You can also follow this procedure when the IBM BPM deployment
   environment has already been created and the IBM BPM default
   generic JVM settings are missing.
   
   1. Open the administrative console.
   
   2. For a stand-alone server (IBM BPM Express) go to Servers >
   Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server1 > Server
   infrastructure > Java and Process Management > Process
   definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic JVM arguments and
   make sure the following entries are included:
    For an IBM SDK, ${IBMSCMX} ${IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON} ${IBMJITPMC}
    For a Sun JVM, ${SUNMAXPERMSIZE}
    -Dsun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true
    -Declipse.bundle.setTCCL=false
   Note the leading dash that is needed for the ?-D? JVM option.
   
   3. For the deployment manager (IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM
   Advanced) go to System administration > Deployment manager >
   Java and Process Management > Process definition > Java Virtual
   Machine > Generic JVM arguments and make sure the following
   entries are included:
    For an IBM SDK, ${IBMSCMX} ${IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON} ${IBMJITPMC}
    For a Sun JVM, ${SUNMAXPERMSIZE}
   
   4. For all application cluster members (IBM BPM Standard and IBM
   BPM Advanced) go to Servers > Clusters > WebSphere application
   server clusters > <appClusterName> > Cluster Members >
   <clusterMemberName> > Server infrastructure > Java and Process
   Management > Process definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic
   JVM arguments and make sure the following entries are included:
    For an IBM SDK, ${IBMSCMX} ${IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON} ${IBMJITPMC}
   -Xmns256m -Xmnx768m -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=0x100000000
    For a Sun JVM, ${SUNMAXPERMSIZE} -XX:NewSize=256m
   -XX:MaxNewSize=768m
    -Dsun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true
    -Declipse.bundle.setTCCL=false
   Note the leading dash that is needed for the ?-D? and ?-X?  ~&#156;
   JVM options.
   
   5. For all messaging and support cluster members in a
   three-cluster topology (IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced)
   go to Servers > Clusters > WebSphere application server clusters
   > <clusterName> > Cluster Members > <clusterMemberName> > Server
   infrastructure > Java and Process Management > Process
   definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic JVM arguments) and
   make sure the following entries are included:
    For an IBM SDK, ${IBMSCMX} ${IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON} ${IBMJITPMC}
    For a Sun JVM, ${SUNMAXPERMSIZE}
   
   6. Save your changes and, in an ND environment (IBM BPM Standard
   and IBM BPM Advanced), synchronize them to the managed nodes.
