QUESTION
 Is Log File Agent supported on Windows 2012? 

ANSWER
LogFile Agent (LFA) 6.2.2 FP04 does not officially support Windows 2012.

LFA v6.2.3.2 was certified on Windows 2012 with one defect/issue found related to monitoring Windows Event Log. This defect is fixed in LFA v6.2.3.2 IF0002.

IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3.2 Log File Agent Multiplatform English (CI8WDEN) 

Recommended is to use version 6.3.
IBM Tivoli Log File Agent V6.3, Multiplatform, Multilingual 
Part Number: CIGM5ML

Note: Upgrading to the v6.3 of the KLO agent is not 
dependent on a v6.3 infrastructure. The minimum pre-req is 6.2.2 FP2.
