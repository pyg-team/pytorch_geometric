ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The steps to upgrade the StoredIQ Appstack from 7.6.0.2 to
   version 7.6.0.3 are not documented properly on the IBM
   Knowledge Center. The steps are out of sequence and present the
   user with steps to perform before prerequisite steps have been
   done due to the format of how they are presented on the site.
   
   If the user follows the steps documented the following file
   will be written to the local directory that the user is logged
   into:
   login?r=%2Fproducts%2Fappstack%2Fcentos%2F7.6.0.3+29%2Fsiq-appst
   ack-1.1.14+43-1.x86_64.rpm
   Subsequent commands will fail to run properly.
   
   To Diagnose the issue follow these steps:
   Confirm port 80 is open by navigating to this URL before
   executing any of the StoredIQ upgrade steps (substitute your
   gateway server IP address for the placeholder <gateway server
   IP> ):
   
   http://<gateway server IP>/products
   
   You should see different folders with the application stack
   versions listed
