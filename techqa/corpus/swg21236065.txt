RATLC01103949; WAS; WASv6; RATLC01103949; PK15766; RAD; RSA; XML transforms; xml transformations; exceptions in WAS server console; running in debug mode; xml dataformat exceptions; Rational Software Architect; javax.xml.transform.TransformerException; WAS debug mode; 1236065; RATLC01103949 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD), servlet code in a Dynamic Web Project that runs an XSL transformation successfully runs and displays expected output when the IBM WebSphere® Application Server v6 server is running in regular mode, but fails when the server is running in debug mode, with exceptions. 

CAUSE
Here is a sample from the exception trace log in the server's console view in RAD:
============================================= 
[11/18/05 15:09:16:835 EST] 0000003b SystemErr R [Fatal Error]
copiedStream:input.xml:1:63: Content is not allowed in trailing section.
[11/18/05 15:09:17:116 EST] 0000003b SystemErr R

java.io.UTFDataFormatException: Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence.

============================================= 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Having the checkbox labeled "hot method replace in debug mode" in the RAD Server Overview editor checked or unchecked for a WebSphere Application Server version 6 server does not matter in this case. This problem is caused by a defect in Application Server version 6.0.x, tracked as APAR PK15766. 


The fix for this issue is available in the Application Server version 6.0.2.7 server update. Once you update your server to the 6.0.2.7 level, this issue is resolved and you no longer get the referenced exceptions while running the XSL transformation code on a server in debug mode. See a link to the WAS updates under "Related information" below.
