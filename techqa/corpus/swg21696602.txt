Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects IBM PureApplication System. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]
DESCRIPTION: 

The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100386 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100386] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 · IBM PureApplication System V1.0
· IBM PureApplication System V1.1
· IBM PureApplication System V2.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The deployed Red Hat Linux-based virtual machines on all IBM PureApplication Systems types are affected. The solution is to apply the following IBM PureApplication System emergency fix to the deployed virtual machines.
http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV_RHEL6_X64_GLIBC_PA_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV_RHEL6_X64_GLIBC_PA_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0]

1. Import the fix into the Emergency Fix catalogue.
2. For deployed instances, apply this emergency fix on the VM. The glibc will be upgraded to 2.12-1.149.el6_6.5.

This emergency fix can be applied to: 

 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux System 2.0 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.1 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.2 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.3 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.4 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.1.0.0 
 * IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.1.0.1


After updates have been applied, you must restart any process using glibc. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.
