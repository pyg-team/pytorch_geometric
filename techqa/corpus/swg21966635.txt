Title: IBM Event Info or Vulnerability Help may not display properly in SiteProtector Console - United States

Text:
X-Force Exchange; Internet Explorer; redirection; browser TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may no longer be able to view event information help or vulnerability help after the recent redirection to the X-Force Exchange website. 

SYMPTOM
You may have problems viewing the event/vulnerability help info when they right click an event and select "Open Event Details", or when they right click an event and select "View Security Information". 

The errors may appears as script pop-up errors, or as a message saying the browser version is too low.

Note: Symptoms may appear similar for some issues but the causes can be very different.


CAUSE
An incorrect setting within Internet Explorer's registry settings prevents the embeddable browser from rendering content at the correct browser version. Instead the content may be rendered in a lower mode, such as Internet Explorer 9 mode or Internet Explorer 5/Quirks mode. However, because X-Force Exchange (and some XGS Policy Editor versions) require Internet Explorer 10 or higher, users may see an error.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Recommendations by Case Type 


Case 1: You are using Internet Explorer 9 or lower

Notes: All customers running Internet Explorer 9 or lower will have problems viewing event info.

Cause: X-Force Exchange, and some XGS Policy Editor versions require Internet Explorer 10 or higher.

Workaround: You must first upgrade your browser to Internet Explorer 10 or higher. After having upgraded the browser, you will need to log out and close all Consoles so that the new browser version is used.


Case 2: You are using SiteProtector 3.0 and Internet Explorer 10 or higher

Cause: SiteProtector 3.0 uses a different browser type for event info than for the XGS Policy Editor. Also, browser emulation workarounds added for SiteProtector 3.1.1 are not present in the older version.

Workaround: Close any open Consoles on the system, and run the EventInfoRegistryWorkaround.zip workaround script that is available at the bottom of this article.


Case 3: You are using SiteProtector 3.1.1 and using Internet Explorer 10 or higher

Notes: SiteProtector 3.1.1 has some built-in workarounds to try to prevent browser problems, however problems can still occur in some situations.

Cause: This can occur on SiteProtector 3.1.1 due to conflicting browser settings. In some cases, the console or the browser have been upgraded but the settings did not have a chance to fully update by logging out after the upgrade. 

Workaround: Close any open Consoles on the system, fully log out of Windows, and log back in (from Start > Log Off). If the problem still occurs after logging back in, run the EventInfoRegistryWorkaround.zip workaround script available at the bottom of this article.


Case 4: You see a "Not Authorized" message after trying to view event help.

Notes: The "Not Authorized" message is seen when the customer fails to log into the site with "Log in as Guest" selected or after the first time they have logged into the site.

Cause: After you log in (as guest or other), the site sends a cookie to the browser and you should not see this message again. However, the page loads behind the login screen so you might still see the "not authorized" message the first time.

Workaround: You need to log in with the "Log in as Guest" link and then reload the page.


Case 5: You see a message from the browser such as "The page cannot be displayed"

Notes: This may happen in environments that have restricted network access to the internet. In this case the page is also not viewable from Internet Explorer itself.

Cause: Your network access is restricted and the browser can not connect to the X-Force Exchange website.

Workaround: You need to make sure that the system can connect to the X-Force Exchange website and that it connects properly in Internet Explorer before attempting to view it in SiteProtector. This is most likely a firewall, proxy, or similar device that is blocking the access to the website.

Note:Console upgrades may undo some of the workaround changes from the workaround script. Therefore, after a Console upgrade, you may find that the problem can come back, depending on which workaround was needed. 

If the suggested workarounds do not work, collect a full registry export while the SiteProtector Console is open along with the contents of the workaround script's output directory. Add these to a compressed file and send it to Support for review.


Case 6: You see a message from the browser such as "You are using an outdated browser"
