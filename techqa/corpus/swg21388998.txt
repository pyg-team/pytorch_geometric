QUESTION
 Unable to filter syslog probe events via the nodeAlias field since it is not set, how can I modify the rules file to assign elements to Object Server fields 

ANSWER
 
1) The syslog probe reads the props file and connects to the Object server.The probe's binary retrieves the event stream from the source eg ( SNMP traps or log files). 

2) The probe tokenizes the event stream, based on the rules file, tokens are assigned to Object server fields. The event is sent to the Object Server (alerts.status). 
You can assign values to ObjectServer fields in the following ways: 

a) Direct assignment, for example: @Node = $Node 
b) Concatenation, for example: @Summary = $Summary + $Group 
c) Adding text, for example: @Summary = $Node + "has problem" + $Summary 

Note: 

Elements are indicated by the $ symbol in the rules file. For example ($Node = node name of the event source.) You can assign elements to ObjectServer fields, indicated by the @ symbol in the rules file. Available elements are listed in the probe guide.
