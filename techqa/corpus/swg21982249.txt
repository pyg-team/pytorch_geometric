QUESTION
 I have add new LDAP users in to Atlas application but why does those users are not able to login to Atlas ? 

CAUSE
You will notice the following error in Atlas log PAearlog.log.

javax.naming.CommunicationException: simple bind failed
CAUSED BY: CertPathBuilderException: PKIXCertPathBuilderImpl could not build a valid CertPath.

ANSWER
 

For an LDAPS or HTTPS connection, the java runtime needs to use the respective SSL certificate for creating a secured connection with the server at the other end. For picking up the SSL certificate from its keystore, the certificate should first be installed in the Java Key store. 

Please work with LDAP administrator to resolve this issue.
