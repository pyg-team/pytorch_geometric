importing new signature; OutOfMemoryError TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does importing a new signature fails on TAD4D 7.2.2.1? 

CAUSE
 

On a new successful ILMT 7.2.2.1 Admin Installation, import a new signature file using lmtcli.sh.
Below is the output from the lmtcli.sh; however, the Signature file never imports. 

lmt>login 
Enter user name: wasadmin 
Enter user password: ******
CODCL0033I: The command has been successfully performed.
lmt>impcat -f _2011_08_26_08_04_52_CANONICAL_FORM_FOR_722.xml 
CODCL0035I: The command execution has been started. 
[0%] 
CODIC0001I: Catalog import has been started.
CODCL0033I: The command has been successfully performed.
lmt>quit 

After verifying the signature, its timestamp does NOT change. 



ANSWER
 

Setting the Heap size min/max within ISC fixes the problem so that Signature file import = 100% successful.

The reason for this issue is too small amount of memory allocated to the application (the javacore shows that the error is OutOfMemoryError and currently it is 

configured to start with only 50Mb and 256Mb max). The recommended memory settings for LMT are min 256Mb and max 1024Mb. It looks that the application crashes while 

decompressing the file you are trying to import catalog from. 

You can change the memory settings in the Integrated Solutions Console. 
In order to do this, please go to: 
Servers > Application servers > server1 > Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine and set Initial Heap Size for 256 and Maximum Heap Size for 1024, than click 

"Apply" and than: "Save directly to the master configuration". After that please restart WAS with ILMT and re-import the new signature.
