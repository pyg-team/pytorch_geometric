Title: IBM DashTools failed to install,  DASH Home path not valid. - United States

Text:
DASHL2INST; DashTools; .tipinfo.properties; JazzSM; Page Cycler; install TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing DashTools, the script failed because it could not find the JazzSM Home as defined on the command line: "The DASH home path is not valid" and "the system cannon find the path specified" 

SYMPTOM
The installation of DashTools failed with these resulting errors: 

1) Using pathname: C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM smadmin smadmin 

 TIPINFO=C:\Program\ui\properties\.tip.properties, The DASH home path is not valid 

 

2) Using pathname: C:\"Program Files"\IBM\JazzSM smadmin smadmin 

 The system cannot find the file C:\"Program Files"\IBM\JazzSM\ui\properties\.tipinfo.properties


CAUSE
When you have "Program Files" in the path, the install script treats it like there is an additional parameter.


ENVIRONMENT
Installing DashTools on Windows with JazzSM 1.1.2.1 and path to JazzSM Home has "Program Files" included.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Here are two examples of of the install execution is incorrect: 

This case, no double quotes were used anywhere: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983225&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983225&aid=1]

In this example, double quotes were placed around "Program Files"

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983225&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983225&aid=2]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the path to JazzSM Home directory contains "Program Files", you need to place double quotes around the whole path, not just around "Program Files": 

Example: install.bat "C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM" smadmin <smadmin password>"
