Title: IBM Java OOM condition using WTX/ITX node in IIB 9.0.0.6 along with calls to Java - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Java memory leak (leading to an out-of-memory condition) may be detected when using an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) node in IBM Integration Broker 9.0.0.6. The Java stack leak has been observed where there are calls to Java from within both a Compute Node and from within the WTX/ITX map using the JEXIT() function. 

SYMPTOM
The Java heap continues to grow, eventually being exhausted, causing a program crash.


CAUSE
Interactions with Java Virtual Machine from both the IIB and WTX/ITX products allow a small amount of Java heap memory to be leaked at each execution of the message flow.

ENVIRONMENT
 IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) node in IBM Integration Broker 9.0.0.6 on any supported platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use the Heap Analyser from IBM to review the heap stack at various points, to see the growth in heap usage.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Obtain an apply the fix from APAR PI80153.
