ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When we access iNotes 901FP5/FP6 with the following parameter in
   notes.ini via Internet explorer 11, you notice you can't create
    local archive because there are no menu ("Folder"- "Archive")
   
   iNotes_WA_DefaultFormsFile=iNotes/Forms9s.nsf
   iNotes_WA_FormsFiles=iNotes/Forms9s.nsf
   
   Steps to Reproduce
   
   1 Install Domino 9.0.1FP5/FP6 and set following parameters in
   nots.ini and start Domino Server
   
   iNotes_WA_DefaultFormsFile=iNotes/Forms9s.nsf
   iNotes_WA_FormsFiles=iNotes/Forms9s.nsf
   
   2. Access mail database via Internet Explorer 11
   3.  local archive is enabled at iNotes Tab on server
   configuration  doc
   
   4. You notice you can't archive local because there are no menu
   ("Folder"- "Archive") from right click menu after selecting
   document.
     when "On my computer" was checked on Archive in references.
   
      If you changed from "On my computer" to "On my home server"
   on Archive in iNotes Preference, the "On my computer" become
   gray out and you can't choose it.
   
   In addition, Preform "More"-"Archive"-"Archive Setting" from
   menu on bar or right click menu by selecting doc, you can see
   the following message.
   
   "You need install IBM Notes Browser Plug-in to use this
   function. If you choose not to install now, you will be prompted
   to install again the next time you try to use this function.
   
   Please contact your administrator about getting the IBM Notes
   Browser Plug-in.
   
   Before Install, chose your browser"
   
   But even if we install the  IBM Notes Browser Plug-in , we can't
   perform local archive.
