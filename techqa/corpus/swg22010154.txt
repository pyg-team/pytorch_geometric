SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Workload Manager. IBM Workload Manager has addressed the applicable CVEs 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3732 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a propagation error in the BN_mod_exp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 
CVEID:CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047]for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
TWS uses OpenSSL only for secure communication between internal processes. 

For Tivoli Workload Scheduler Distributed, TWS nodes are impacted by OpenSSL security exposures only if the TWS workstation has been defined with “securitylevel” set to on or enabled or force. 

These security exposures do not apply to the embedded WebSphere Application Server but only to programs installed under <TWS home>/bin. 

Tivoli Workload Scheduler Distributed 8.6.0 FP04 and earlier
Tivoli Workload Scheduler Distributed 9.1.0 FP02 and earlier
Tivoli Workload Scheduler Distributed 9.2.0 FP02 and earlier
IBM Workload Scheduler Distributed 9.3.0 FP03 and earlier
IBM Workload Scheduler Distributed 9.4.0 FP01 and earlier
