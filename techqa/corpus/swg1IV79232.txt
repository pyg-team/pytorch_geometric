APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS VENDOR SOLUTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Due to changes that have been made by Check Point in regards to
   the default and recommendeded implementation of SHA-256 based
   certificates and the lact of support in the OPSEC SDK for
   SHA-256, Log Sources using the LEA Protocol will report failures
   and data will not be collected when using a SHA-256 certificate.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Changing the OPSEC authentication on the Check Point appliance
   to clear instead of sslca and making the same change on the log
   source configuration will allow connectivity, but the data will
   no longer be encrypted.
   
   Another option is to send the data via syslog as described in
   the QRadar documentation.
   
   Please contact Check Point support initially and subseqently
   IBM support if you require further information on this issue.
