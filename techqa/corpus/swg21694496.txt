QUESTION
 While installing JazzSM the following problems were encountered.

1. The prerequisite scanner failed while checking the available file space on a file system with 2 Terabytes available in it

2. TCR failed to install into the directory /home/.dev_tcr 

CAUSE
1. Originally the JazzSM PreRequisite Scanner (PRS) only supports only MB and GB file systems.

2. The current Jazz Installer does not recognize file paths containing a period (.) 

ANSWER
1. The prerequisite scanner version 1.1.0.3 supports only MB and GB file systems.
Support for Terabyte (TB) file systems will be available in the next JazzSM release. 

As of October 2015 the latest prerequisite scanner is version 1.2.0.17 and is available from:

2. The JazzSM installer does not support a path which contains a period in the name, so for now either customer needs to use non-period path for installing JazzSM or they need to create symbolic link for the period special character path.
