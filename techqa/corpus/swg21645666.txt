Title: IBM Blank Cognos Viewer in Internet Explorer when using SSL - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running a report returns a blank (white page) or freezes on "Your report is running" page, when using Internet Explorer. Firefox displays a Cognos error message. 
This only happens when the gateway uses SSL (HTTPS) 

SYMPTOM
IE throws the following error message in the Developer Tools console: 

"SEC7111: HTTPS security is compromised by (null)"

No report is displayed in IE but Firefox shows a page with a Cognos error


CAUSE
Cognos returning HTTP content which is being blocked by IE for not being HTTPS


ENVIRONMENT
Internet Explorer versions 8, 9, 10, and 11 

Cognos BI (all versions)


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Confirm that there is a SEC7111 error thrown by IE



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following resolution only applies to 10.1.1 FP1 or higher, 10.2,10.2.1 and 10.2.2 

add useAlternateErrorCodeRendering=true to the file viewerconfig.properties
or useAlternateErrorCodeRendering set to TRUE as an advanced server setting 

This will make Cognos use a different way of displaying the error message successfully in IE
