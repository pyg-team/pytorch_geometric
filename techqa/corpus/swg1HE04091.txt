ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer Problem :- SmarTeam CWI save is not possible with
   Windows Authentication
   Scenario:
   ---------
   0. Launch CATIA V5.
   1. Connect to SmarTeam through CWI.
   ==> We are using Windows Authentication
   2. Open a New Product / Part in CATIA V5.
   3. Save through CWI.
   ==> The web page is redirected (The SmarTeam Web Editor
   window opens with a logon panel)
   Actual Result: Web Editor screen is redirected to a blank
   "Default" screen and doesn't proceed further. The Save is not
   completed.
   Expected Result: The CATProduct should be saved through
   SmarTeam CWI.
   Addtional information received from Customer:
   ------
   1. The scenario is not reproducible in SmDemo R19 but
   reproducible on the customer's database (DB is attached)
   2. Customer has checked the issue noted in APAR HD85119 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HD85119] /
   BR10000070175 which referred to the analysis that
   TDM_APPL_MAPPING table for a customer database did not
   contain any values, therefore causing a problem with the CWI
   Save. They checked the TDM_APPL_MAPPING table in their
   database and it contains the values defined for Integration
   Mapping.
   Please let us know if there is anything more to be checked in
   TDM_APPL_MAPPING table apart from values...?
   3. While working in SmarTeam Authentication for CWI, if the
   customer switches databasees (during logon) from their
   production Db to SMDemo_R19, connect and disconnect again.
   And then again, switch back to their production Db, then the
   Save Panel comes up and they are able to Save the document.
   However, this works for some time and not all the time. If
   the user tries connecting the session the next day, then the
   old issue comes back again.
   ==> The customer cannot use this as a bypass for this issue
   since we are using using Windows Authentication and also they
   don't want users to accidentally conenct to SmDemo env
   instead of the Production env.
   If Switching of the DB at Login works for some time, has this
   issue something to do with the http cookies etc. ?
   Can you tell us how the Save action is performed from DB
   point of view?
   Is there any setting the customer can do to perform the
   action mentioned above (and prevent the issue)?'
