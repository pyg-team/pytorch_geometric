Title: IBM ADR date/time values lost on commit with IBM FileNet Capture Professional - United States

Text:
adr date time datetime TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When setting a Capture Professional date/time index to autoindex using the value of an ADR date/time field, such as ADR.Statistics:Recognition_DateTime, the value is lost when committing. 

CAUSE
For date/time fields ADR uses the format YYYYMMDD HH:MM, which is not recognized as a date/time field by most library systems including IBM FileNet Content Engine.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two workarounds: 

 * Put the ADR date/time value in a Custom Property set as a string. 
 * Use a date/time field other than an ADR field, such as Properties.CreateDate.
