ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description and statement
   
   When Importing a Shared EAR with a name different from the name
   of the original EAR, the action: Remove Project from Server fail
   s to remove it, because it searches the server for the original
   ear name, while the server knows the EAR with the Imported EAR n
   ame.
   
   Environment
   
   Rational Software Architect for WebSphere 7.5.4
   Websphere Application Server 6.0.2.31/6.0.2.37
   
   Steps to reproduce (from scratch):
   
   create an EAR with an EJB and EJB Client and a WAS project conta
   ining
   a bottom-up EJB WebService (Project Interchange: TestPI.zip)
   
   Export as a shared EAR (TestPEARBinary.ear)
   
   Delete all projects from the workspace and import the
   Binary EAR with a different name (TestPEARBinary) from the origi
   nal EAR name (TestPEAR).
   
   Add the Shared EAR to the server and it publishes fine.
   
   Try to remove the Shared EAR from the server and:
   - In RSA, Server View, the project looks like it had been remove
   d
   - The server status appears as synchronized
   - The Console shows no lines indicating project stop and deletio
   n
   - In the Admin Console the Shared EAR is still published
   and started
   
   Additional considerations:
   
   This is not restricted to Shared EARs, but is far more likely to
    be seen in the Shared EAR scenarios. The problem arrises when t
   he EAR project's name is different than the ?wb-module deploy-na
   me=''? in the EAR project's .settings\org.eclipse.wst.common.com
   ponent file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem of Shared EARs not being able to be removed from
   the WAS server has been fixed. The problem only occured
   when users renamed the EAR project when they brought in the
   shared EARs.  The problem occured because the import did not
   update all of the internal meta-data (specifically the
   project named used by the tools to remove the project from
   the server).  The import code is now fixed so if the user
   renames the project when importing a shared ear the internal
   meta-data is updated.
