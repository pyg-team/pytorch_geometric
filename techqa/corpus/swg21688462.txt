CDC; instance; Oracle; 10g; v$instance TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am getting the following error when trying to create a CDC Oracle Instance.



IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture supports Oracle 10g and above. 

SYMPTOM
Validating database support. Please wait...

IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture supports Oracle 10g and above.

Press ENTER to go to the Main menu...


CAUSE
The CDC Oracle database user has insufficient privileges.
If CDC can't query v$instance we are unable to validate the Oracle version and fail

ENVIRONMENT
InfoSphere Data Replication for Oracle

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Execute the command 
sqlplus <db user>/<db pwd>@<tns name> select version from v$instance

The <db user> should be the same CDC Oracle database user specified when trying to create the instance

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Grant CDC database user v$instance privileges.
