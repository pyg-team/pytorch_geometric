DWC; TDWC; TWS; Windows Service. Windows TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 By default, a Windows service is not created for the JazzSM (DWC) profile during the installation of Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) v9.x. 

SYMPTOM
The Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) is not available after logging off a Windows system or after a reboot. 


CAUSE
This is the default behavior. The Windows service is not created during the installation. 

ENVIRONMENT
This happens only on Windows systems. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can use a built-in WebSphere utility to create the service. 

From a command line, cd into <WebSphere_install_dir>\AppServer\bin and run the wasservicehelper.bat script. 

This will open an interactive command shell. Follow the prompts to create the service. 

The following is provided only as an example: 





C:\Program Files\ibm\WebSphere\AppServer\bin>wasservicehelper.bat

-------------------
Menu Options :
-------------------

1 Add new or update existing WebSphere service (minimum parameters required)
2 Add new or update existing WebSphere service (all parameters)
3 Remove WebSphere service

Select number next to the options
(default 1)[q to Quit]: 1

Cell in setupCmdline: JazzSMNode01Cell

Node in setupCmdline: JazzSMNode01
-------------------
Servers :
-------------------

1 server1

Hint: If the application server is running in an ND environment then only the nodeagent and deployment manager servers should be started as a Windows service.

Warning: In an ND environment, starting the application server as a service may fail under certain conditions where its nodeagent is running.
Select number next to server [q to Quit]: 1

Select number next to start type
(Default 1)[q to Quit]:1

-------------------
*** WebSphere Security ***
-------------------
Hint: Userid needs to be a member of an administrative role with authority to stop a server such as Admin or Operator roles
NOTE: When WebSphere Security is enabled a userid and password is required in order to be able to stop the service

Is WebSphere SECURITY enabled?
(default N)[Y/N][q to Quit]: y
Username : jazzsm

Password: ********
Please re-enter password for verification: ********

Execute :

wasservice.exe -add "JazzSM" -serverName "server1" -profilePath "C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\profile" -encodeParams -stopArgs "-username jazzsm -password ******
**" -startType automatic -restart false

Execute command now?
(default=Yes) [Y/N][q to Quit]:y 

Once these steps are complete you should have a new service for created for the JazzSM profile.
