LOCAL FIX
 *  The error seen is only associated to the workspace, so starting
   a new workspace resolves the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SystemFilterPoolManager.createSystemFilterPool() returns a
   filter pool if it doesn't exist but, if it does already exist,
   null is returned.  This is not normally a problem because this
   is supposed to be called when there is no filter pool.  However,
   in a customer scenario where a user's RSE filter metadata was
   corrupt, having the existing pool returned (rather than null)
   allows the customer to recover from the corruption.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  While it's not clear how a customer's filter metadata got
   corrupt, changing the createSystemFilterPool() code to return an
   existing filter pool rather than null (if one exists) allows
   RSE to recover its filter support.
