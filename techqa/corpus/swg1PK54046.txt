PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of  DB2 Administration Tool            *
   *                 who use ALC and change management            *
   *                 function.                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In DB2 Administration Tool, when using  *
   *                      ALC and Change Management to change     *
   *                      the table's database or table space,    *
   *                      a RC08 may occur in the merge step      *
   *                      when performing the analyze function.   *
   *                      The reported symptom is "...no base     *
   *                      definition found." Additional errors    *
   *                      during register or analyze may occur    *
   *                      due to multiple SQL statements not      *
   *                      being registered or an absent           *
   *                      statement to drop the primary key.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   An improper change statement was being produced by exec
   ADB2CCA during the registration of the change. Multiple
   statements passed to the register component by ALC were
   not split into individual statements.  This could lead to a
   variety of errors, such as a particular element of the change
   not being performed. When altering the primary key or dropping
   a primary key column, the DROP PRIMARY KEY statement was not
   being registered. This could lead to a message issued during
   the analyze process: "<tablename> already has a primary key".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problems have been fixed.
