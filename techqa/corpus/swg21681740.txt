QUESTION
 Why the ".com_ibm_tools_attach" directory is created under /tmp directory after DB2 installation? 

CAUSE
After DB2 installation the following directory and subdirectories are created under /tmp directory:

drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4096 Aug 1 16:22 .com_ibm_tools_attach

ls -ltra /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach

drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4096 Aug 1 16:22 .
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Aug 1 16:22 _master
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Aug 1 16:22 _notifier
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Aug 1 16:22 _attachlock

ANSWER
This is solely due to the Java Attach API. The Attach API is enabled by default for Java 6 SR 6 or later and creates working files in a common directory by default in the system temporary directory. On non-Windows systems, the system temporary directory is typically /tmp.
