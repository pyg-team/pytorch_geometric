Title: IBM "Last login information is not available." from secondary SMS server - United States

Text:
DB2 lastlogin cluster standalone TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Last login information cannot be retrieved from an additional Session Management Servers configured in the WebSEAL config file. 

CAUSE
Session Management Servers are configured as stand-alone WAS environments and use DB2 for storing the Last Login information.

ANSWER
When using multiple SMS servers, they need to be clustered according to the documentation. When this requirement is not perfectly implemented , it could happen that only 1 of the serves configured in [dsess-cluster] can retrieve last login information from the DB2 .
