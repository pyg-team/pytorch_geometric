ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RATLC00731381
   Environment:
    - OS : windows 2000, english
    - Database: Oracle, client_ver= 8.0
    - Product name ClearQuest 2003.06.13, Build:
   MCK_PATCH_2004C.D040830
   Reproducible Y/N: yes
   Description of problem:
   Would like to upgrade from 2002 to 2003.06.13.
   In the connect options is  client_ver = 8.0 in both
   Schema Repository and User database. An upgrade of the
   connection to client_ver 8.1 is working properly in the
   Maintenance Tool.
   The upgrade of the User Datbase Properties in ClearQuest
   Desinger however always results in error: Client_ver 8.0 not
   supported.
   Step to reproduce: Open CQ Desinger where a Oracle database with
   client_ver= 8.0 is associated. Go to menu Database - Update Use
   database Properties
   Click on Properties and change the client_ver to client_ver=8.1
   Error occurs
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make an update of the connect options to client_ver=8.1 with an
   earlier version of ClearQuest
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Oracle clients are no longer used with ClearQuest as of
   2003.06.
   13. A change to the list of supported version
   numbers and to the
    way in which Oracle property changes were
   handled produced this
    problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in ClearQuest 7.0.0.0.  CQ code needed to be modified
   in order to allow a dbset's connect options to be modified
   even if the original connect options were no longer valid.
