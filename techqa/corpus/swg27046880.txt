ABSTRACT
WebSphere Java Non-serviceable files

CONTENT
The following files in the WebSphere Application Server default java installation directory, or in the extension offering java installation directories are considered non-serviceable files. These files are shipped one time only, with the first installation of the product, and will not be updated again when WebSphere Application Server java i-fixes are applied, nor when WebSphere Application Server fix packs are applied.

WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER V9 
All files are serviceable

WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER V8.5.5.14 AND IBM SDK, JAVA TECHNOLOGY EDITION VERSION 8 SR5 FP15 AND LATER

Notes:

 * As of WebSphere Application Server fix pack 8.5.5.14 and IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition Version SR5 FP15, the java.security file is serviceable. When service is applied by an i-fix or a fix pack update, a one time back up of the WAS_HOME/java/jre/lib/security/java.security file will be placed in the same directory with the file extension .bak and the original file will be replaced.
 * Please use the WAS_HOME/Properties/java.security file to override or extend java.security properties of the JVM. This file is non-serviceable so your changes will remain when updates are installed.
 * Many security updates become available through changes to the java.security file. To be certain that WebSphere Application Server is as secure as possible, the WAS_HOME/java/jre/lib/security/java.security file needs to be kept current.
