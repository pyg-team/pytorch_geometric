APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You would like to perform a silent installation of IBM SPSS
   Statistics 24 on Apple Macintosh OSX 10.12 Sierra.
   
   From Passport Advantage you downloaded the silent installer file
   SPSS_Statistics_24_mac_silent.dmg from below package:
   
   IBM SPSS Statistics Client 24.0 Mac OS Silent Multilingual
   (CND2FML )
   Size 1,457MB, Date posted: 23 Jun 2016
   
   Then, on the documentation below you read, that as prerequisite
   Java must be installed on the Mac first but you wonder which
   Java? The latest Oracle JRE or the latest JDK?
   
   Authorized_User_License_Administrator_Guide.pdf  for Macintosh
   from:
   
   ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/s
   tatistics/24.0/en/client/InstallationDocuments/MacOS/Authorized_
   User_License_Administrator_Guide.pdf
   
   Go to the chapter about silent installation for Macintosh, page
   5 and 6.
   
   On page 6 you only see below sentence:
   
   "Note: To run the silent installer on Mac OS, Java must be
   installed."
   
   However, for customers it is not clear what Java needs to be
   installed.
   
   If for example you like to install SPSS 24 on Mac OSX Sierra
   10.12 you have to install the JDK first in order for silent
   installation to work on MacOSX 10.12 Sierra. Silent installtion
   works fine if the JDK is installed first.
   
   To get to the Java JDK download page, you can navigate to it
   from Oracles Java website
   1. Go to https://www.java.com/en/ [https://www.java.com/en/]
   
   2. Select 'Dowload'
   
   3 Select 'See All Java downloads'
   
   4. Select 'Looking for the JDK?'
   
   5. Select 'Go to JDK downloads' under 'Where do I get JDK
   download', which takes you here:
   
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-js [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-js]
   p-138363.html#javasejdk
   
   6. Select Download button under JDK for Java SE 8u121
   
   7. Select the Download file for Mac OS X
   
   Or the Download page for the latest JDK  (Java SE 8u121) is
   here:
   
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-dow
   nloads-2133151.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html]
