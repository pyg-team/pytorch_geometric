QUESTION
 What Update Report Utilities are Available? 

ANSWER
Report update utilities are available for you to automate the process of applying updates to report designs, rather than manually editing each report. These update utilities supplement the existing utilities of importing and exporting report designs.
This guide is applicable for the Maximo 7.1.1.5 and future releases, along with the Maximo 7.5.0.0 thru 7.5.02 releases.

Beginning with Maximo 7.5.0.3, a new Report Update Utilities guide is available here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605830]

Additionally, you can find more details on other reporting features by accessing the Maximo Report Wiki Pages available here [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/IBM%20Maximo%20Asset%20Management/page/Reporting] or the Maximo Report Reference Materials located here [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Maximo%20Asset%20Management/page/Reporting%20Documentation]
