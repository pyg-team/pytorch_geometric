[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27009288&amp;aid=1] Back to all detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27006921] 
IBM strives to deliver to our customers information that promotes the creation of the most reliable operating environment for IBM WebSphere Application Server. The list on the supported product site [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27006921] identifies those products that IBM believes can provide an operating environment that meets this standard. However, IBM's testing and analysis of the Application Server performance may determine that the Application Server performance may not meet this standard when used in an operating environment with specific products. IBM believes that the Application Server will not reliably deliver the level of performance for which it was designed, and therefore IBM does not support the Application Server when used in an operating environment that contains the following products.

Required details: 

1 If you need to use the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database with WebSphere Application Server V6.0.2 or V5.1.1, you might be able to acquire a third-party JDBC driver that supports connectivity to the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database. This scenario would be supported by the application server according to the limitations outlined under the Other configurations in support article WebSphere Application Server has grown and so have your requirements. [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&context=SSEQTP&uid=swg27004311] To minimize incompatibilities, configure the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database to run in SQL Server 2000 compatibility mode.
