QUESTION
 A DNS server in the network was issued a new IP address. How do I change the DNS server values of my QRadar managed hosts from the command line? 

CAUSE
A DNS server in the network was issued a new IP address. The DNS server entries can be changed with the qchange_netsetup command. However, administrators should understand that the qchange_netsetup command requires the affected managed hosts to be removed from the deployment. In larger deployments, this process can be time consuming to remove, update DNS settings, and re-add the managed host to the deployment. A command line option is available to update the DNS settings without having to remove each managed host in the network. 




ANSWER
To change the DNS entries on a QRadar 7.2.x or 7.3.x appliance without removing it from the deployment administrators must use the command-line interface. 


 

Before you begin 

 * Updates to DNS settings are completed on a per appliance basis and root access is required for each appliance. If your DNS server IP address changes in your network, you need to repeat the procedure on each host that requires a DNS address update. 
 * You cannot SSH directly to a QRadar managed host. All direct connections to a managed host are blocked by default. Administrators must SSH to the Console appliance, then open an SSH session to connect to a managed host. 
 * Administrators should only use this option if they are familiar with Linux/Unix and editing files in the command-line interface. If you are unsure of any steps in this procedure, QRadar Support can assist (http://ibm.biz/qradarsupport [http://ibm.biz/qradarsupport]). 
 * Administrators with All-on-One appliances can follow the standard DNS update procedures outlined here: QRadar Network Settings Management [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS42VS_7.3.1/com.ibm.qradar.doc/c_siem_ntw_man_set.html].
   
   
   



Procedure for QRadar 7.2.x appliances 
To change the DNS settings from the command-line for a QRadar 7.2.x appliance:  1. Using SSH, log in to the Console as the root user. 
 2. Optional. Open an SSH session to the managed host that needs a DNS update. 
 3. Type the following command to backup your existing resolv.conf file: cp /etc/resolv.conf /root/resolv.conf. 
 4. To edit the DNS values, type the following command: vim /etc/resolv.conf. 
 5. Update the nameserver fields with the IP address of your primary or secondary DNS server.
    
    For example: 
    nameserver 192.0.2.100 is your primary DNS server IP address.
    nameserver 192.0.2.200 is your secondary DNS server IP address.
     
    
    
 6. Press :wq to save the file and exit vim.
    
    Results
    No service restarts are required for QRadar 7.2.x appliances. The administrator can repeat this procedure for any additional managed hosts in the deployment that require a DNS settings update. 
    
    
    



Procedure for QRadar 7.3.x appliances
To change the DNS settings from the command-line for a QRadar 7.3.x appliance:  1. Using SSH log in to the Console as the root user. 
 2. Optional. Open an SSH session to the managed host that needs a DNS update 
 3. Type the following command to backup your existing resolv.conf file: cp /etc/resolv.conf.masq /root/resolv.conf.masq. 
 4. To edit the DNS values, type the following command: vim /etc/resolv.conf.masq. 
 5. Update the nameserver fields with the IP address of your primary or secondary DNS server.
    
    For example: 
    nameserver 192.0.2.100 is your primary DNS server IP address.
    nameserver 192.0.2.200 is your secondary DNS server IP address.
     
    
    
 6. Press :wq to save the file and exit vim. 
 7. To restart the dnsmasq service, type: systemctl restart dnsmasq
    
    Results
    After services restart, the change is complete. The administrator can repeat this procedure for any additional managed hosts in the deployment that require a DNS settings update.
