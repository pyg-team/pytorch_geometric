   *                 accurate time management using leap seconds. *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On December 31st, 2016, an additional   *
   *                      leap second will be inserted between    *
   *                      23:59:59 UTC and 00:00:00 UTC of the    *
   *                      following day.  Times and time stamps   *
   *                      from after that point in time will need *
   *                      to account for this extra leap second   *
   *                      when they are being converted from      *
   *                      internal to external formats.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY CORRECTIVE SERVICE                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   The new leap second added at the end of Decmber 31st 2016 needs
   to be accounted in time and time stamp conversions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The new leap second will be added to the internal tables used in
   time and time stamp conversions.
