Title: IBM Archive/Backup configuration change fails with error "Please correct the following errors and try again:" - United States

Text:
testfile; test-file; transfer; fail; application; apply; export TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to make a change to archive/backup configuration, the 'apply' button returns an error:

" Please correct the following errors and try again: 

A test data file could not be sent to this host with the parameters given. Please confirm the hostname or IP address is entered correctly, the host is online, the target directory exists and can be written to by the user given, and the password given is correct for that user. "


SYMPTOM
The above error persists after the configuration has been verified as correct


CAUSE
When the configuration is applied, the test file is sent to the target directory to verify it is accessible. The test file should then be deleted automatically. Occasionally the file is not deleted and persists. In this case further test file transfers will fail and thus cause the configuration application to fail.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look through the target directory on the target server to see if any test files remain.


the test files will have a format similar to this 

 * scp_test_file.deleteme_<user>_<hostname>


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Delete the old test files in the target directory
2. Attempt to apply the changes again
