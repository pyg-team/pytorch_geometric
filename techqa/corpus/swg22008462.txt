Micro Story Points Progress TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the 'Story Point Progress' report take so long to load? 

CAUSE
Users regularly use the report 'Story Points Progress' and add it to their dashboard and for some users this can take a long time to run.

ANSWER
This report can take a long time to load when the results returned for the user is very large. 

Look at the ccm.log file and search for "Micro Story Points Progress that run a query that exceeded the result set size of" 

 

You may see results similar to the following:
WARN com.ibm.team.reports - User clmadmin in project area My Project displayed report Micro Story Points Progress that run a query that exceeded the result set size of 40000

This tells us that for the clmadmin user the result of the query is very large. This will lead to a delay in displaying the results. 

 

In this instance the report is not suitable for inclusion in the Dashborard and we would recommend removing it for this user.
