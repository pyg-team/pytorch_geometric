Title: IBM NetView z/OS V5R4 and Higher : Where is sample CNMSJM14 ? - United States

QUESTION
 NetView V5R3 APAR OA23604 introduced new sample CNMSJM14 to allow clients to have an SMP/E usermod (NVUMEMA) to copy relevant NetView EMA (enterprise management agent) files to the ITM (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) product libraries. Prior to this APAR, customers would have to copy the necessary files manually.

Customer had upgraded to V5R4 and noticed that CNMSJM14 was no longer supplied and questioned whether it was still needed. The same exists for V6. 

CAUSE
product re-packaging

ANSWER
The CNMSJM14 sample is no longer provided in V5R4 (and higher) for the simple reason that the packaging of the EMA has changed, and the copying of files is no longer needed. 

With NetView the newer levels of NetView (above V5R3) the NetView EMA agent was split out into its own separate FMID and feature code, and has been removed from the base NetView program installation. When running the EMA installation using SMP/E, the NetView EMA agent is to be installed into the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) target libraries, directly into the same SMP/E CSI as ITM rather than within the NetView base CSI. There are no net new datasets with the EMA, it is simply a packaging technique to allow direct placement of the code in the ITM libraries without need for manual copying or a usermod like CNMSJM14.

If client does not have the EMA with V5R4 or higher, it must be separately ordered; it is free and no longer shipped together with NetView base code. 

To obtain the NetView EMA, contact IBM Marketing or customer software license personnel.

For V5R4 for example, product number 5697-ENV feature number 5812 is the EMA (there is a similar related product number for 5697-NV6 for NetView V6).

The EMA will come with its own Program Directory and installation instructions. You simply install the new EMA FMID into the same CSI as ITM. NetView can be in the same CSI as the EMA and ITM, but that is not mandatory. The only requirement is that the EMA is installed in the same CSI as ITM.
