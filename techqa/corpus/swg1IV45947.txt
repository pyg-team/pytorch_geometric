ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  when trying to copy jobplan to WO, wrong value is filled up
   from jobtask to wo task.
   
   Version of Maximo :  UTIL7501 with BS7504
   
   1. Go to the Domains App - Find PLUSDTASKTYPE
      add a new value "ORG" . Set Organization as EAGLENA.
   2. Go to the Jobplan (T&D) application
      New jobplan ( JPTEST01). Set Orgid/Siteid as EAGLENA/BEDFORD.
      Add new line for jobtask.
      Look up TASKTYPE . Then, ORG value id not displayed ( it
   seems
   caused by the reason "JOBTASK object's level is SYSTEM level" )
      Anyway, select PIPE for TASKTYPE.
      Save jobplan
      Change status to Active
   
   3. Go to the Work Order Tracking (T&D) - new WO
      Set Jobplan field with JPTEST01 created in the step 2.
      Save
      Go to the Plans\Tasks table.
      You can see that one Task line is copied from jobtask.
   TASKTYPE is PIPLE. It shouldnot be copied to wo task.
      But, when trying to manually selecting TASKTYPE in WO task,
   you only can see the lookup value "ORG" .
      It will cause data validation issue.
