APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Design Mode the Tabbed panel will truncate its content based
   on the width specified for the tabbed panel. This makes it hard
   to work on a dataTable whose width is wider than size (in design
    mode anyway)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Visualizer for tabbed panels was using a SPAN element with
   size set according to width and height attributes and
   overflow style set to auto. While this worked fine in
   Preview, Design mode does not support "overflow" styles and
   hence the content of the tab was clipped.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Visalizer was fixed not to limit SPAN's size in Design mode.
   
   Now, In Design mode, the tab expands to accommodate the
   entire content, while maintaining the miminum size specified
   by width and height attributes.
   
   Preview mode acts as before, showing a horizontal scrollbar
   when content doesn't fit into specified size.
