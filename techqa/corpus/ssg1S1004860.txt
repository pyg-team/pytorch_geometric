 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Apache Tomcat DoS and unauthorized access vulnerabilities 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
This bulletin relates to vulnerabilities in the Apache Tomcat component which is used to provide the productâ€™s management GUI. The CLI interface is unaffected.
CVEID: CVE-2013-4286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, caused by an incomplete fix related to the handling of malicious request. By sending a specially-crafted request in a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and a Content-length header to the Apache HTTP server that will be reassembled with the original Content-Length header value, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2013-4322 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an incomplete fix related to the processing of chunked transfer coding without properly handling a large total amount of chunked data or whitespace characters in an HTTP header value. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-0075 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0075]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked request. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93365 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93365] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-0099 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0099]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check for overflows when parsing content length headers. By sending specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93369 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93369] for more information
