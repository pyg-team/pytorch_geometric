ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There was an issue encountered when deploying a paa file in a
   clustered environment when auto sync was turned off.  The issue
   arose as solution installer was waiting for a sync to complete
   before continuing with the running of xmlaccess scripts.  As the
   nodes couldn't be automatically synchronized, the wait for sync
   task was timing out.  Solution installer will now check that the
   deployment is being done in a clustered environment with auto
   sync turned on before calling the task to wait for the sync to
   complete.
   Opened for release 8001
