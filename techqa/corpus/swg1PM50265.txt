   TEXT READS:
   Preconfiguring the Virtual Portal Manager portlet
   When you use the Virtual Portal Manager portlet to create a
   virtual portal, the portlet creates the new virtual portal with
   default portal content and resources. It also creates default
   access rights for the virtual portal subadministrators on those
   resources. You can change both the default portal content and
   the default access rights for the subadministrators globally and
   before creating a virtual portal. To do this, you configure the
   Virtual Portal Manager portlet and the default XML script:
   * For details about how to change the default content for
   virtual portals refer to Preconfiguring the default content for
   virtual portals.
   * For details about how to change the roles and access
   rights for subadministrators on portlets refer to Preconfiguring
   the subadministrators for virtual portals.
