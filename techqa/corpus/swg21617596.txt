Title: IBM Question about SAz/OS timer definitions - United States

Text:
sazos timer defs definitions every kicked TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Scheduled EVERY timer with From and To specified using the SAz/OS dialogs, but the timer doesn't pop (not kicked off) at the specified To time. 

SYMPTOM
Scheduled the following timer using the SAz/OS dialogs:

EVERY 01:00:00 From 00:45:00 to 04:45:00

But the timer only popped (was kicked off) at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, and 03:45, but NOT at 04:45


CAUSE
This is because the To time is actually the End time when the timer expires, thus it doesn't pop (not kicked off) at that time.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was resolved by setting the timer as follows:

EVERY 01:00:00 From 00:45:00 to 04:45:05

Now it pops at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, 03:45, and 04:45 as required.
