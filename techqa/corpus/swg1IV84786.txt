APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Linux OS Agent by default monitors all filesystem types.
   There are options only to exclude NFS and CIFS types. It does
   not provide any options to filter out other specific types. In
   servers configurations where there is a huge number of
   filesystems the Disk data collection may become extremely slow,
   and it would be useful to filter out the filesystem types that
   are not needed.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This issue affects all the Linux OS agent versions and it does
   not depend on the Linux OS version.
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium, unneeded monitoring of filesystems can introduce
   performance issues on the server where the agent runs.

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: Performance impacts due to missing option
    for excluding unneeded filesystem types on Linux
   Problem/Problem Summary: The Monitoring Agent for Linux OS only
    provides the possibility to choose whether or not NFS and CIFS
    filesystems must be monitored. Any other types cannot be
    excluded. In case of a large number of filesystems of the same
    type that don't need to be monitored, this limitation can
    introduce performance issues on the agent. In order for this
    APAR to be properly implemented in your environment, a new
    environment variable has been added. See the "Install Actions"
    section of the APAR conclusion for more details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem conclusion: Introduced new environment variable that
    allows to exclude a list of filesystem types.
   Install Actions:
    set KLZ_EXCLUDE_FSTYPE=<comma separated list of types> in the
    lz.ini configuration file. Example:
     KLZ_EXCLUDE_FSTYPE=mvfs,ext3. The
    The names must match exactly those shown by command "mount -l".
    In case of conflict with KBB_SHOW_NFS or KBB_SHOW_CIFS
    settings, KLZ_EXCLUDE_FSTYPE takes priority.

   maintenance packages:
