QUESTION
 Netezza client installed for Linux workstation, however we do not find “nzudxcompile” program as part of it. How to do UDX development remotely ? 

ANSWER
Nzudxcompile is used to compile the source object files for a UDX. IBM does not support 3rd party compilers for Netezza. Compilation must be done on Netezza host just as registration of the UDX must be done. It is not possible to copy the the object code from a remote client. 

As a best practice, develop your UDX and compile on a development appliance first. 

Clients may elect to provide make files and source to database administrators for compilation and registration to other PureData for Analytic (Netezza) appliances. 

See the link for best practices for UDX development within the documentation at the IBM Knowledge Center.
