PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Exceptions reported in the HibernatingPolicyActivator log file are not relevant to the action of the Hibernate() function in the Policy 

SYMPTOM
Exceptions observed in the HibernatingPolicyActivator log file like: 

 * 
 * 


seem to indicate a problem with the action of the Hibernate() function in the Policy when it has performed correctly. When comparing the exception with the netcool-errors.log and PolicyLogger log file the issue is found to be from some other part of the Policy subsequent to the Hibernation. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The HibernatingPolicyActivator log file shows the Hibernation occurring and waking up as expected and the PolicyLogger log file concurs with this and the netcool-errors.log provides further details of an unrelated issue. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The actual issue is known behaviour in the Policy configuration and variable handling with User Defined Functions as recorded in the TechNote "Unsolicited SQL updates from User Defined Function" [link below]. The use of such variables in a function call causes the issue: 




 * 


So, adapting the above function call per the TechNote it would read: 

 * 
 *
