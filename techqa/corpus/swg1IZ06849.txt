APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I discovered this a few days prior to the client reporting it
   This only occurs with whole minutes and not if one chose x
   minutes and 1 second.
   
   You can force it to use minutes by setting it in the DataType
   .type file and restarting the ImpactServer to bring in the
   configuration.
   
   The value for the timeout (QUERYCACHEINVALIDATION) is set in
   total seconds and converted to sexagesimal for display in the
   DataType editor GUI.
   
   Opening the DataType editor GUI against such a .type file forced
   configuration will incur the GUI error again.
   
   The error being a dialogue box requesting a valid invalidation
   time value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the value via the .type file, restart the ImpactServer to
   read in the value and never open the DataType editor against
   that DataType again...
   
   OR:
   
   Go for x minutes and 1 second instead of whole minutes.
