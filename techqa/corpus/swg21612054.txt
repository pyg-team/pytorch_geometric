 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the installation complete, but have errors when installing or upgrading on AIX?
Why does the Content Manager OnDemand server or arsdb commands fail to start or drop the server after upgrading or installing on AIX.


CAUSE
The usual cause of this could be that the Content Manager OnDemand server or WebSphere Application Server (WAS) was not stopped and the Install Anywhere installer was not able to replace all the executable and libraries.

ANSWER
Review the log file in the /tmp directory. See the table below for a list of log file names. 

You will have error messages like the following: 

 * 
 * 
 * 

These messages will tell you what modules the installer is having trouble overwriting. You can also verify this by looking at the dates of these modules and make sure they match the dates on the other installed files. 

Or, check the console for output of the arssockd command: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Or, check the output of the arsdb command:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

To correct these errors, make sure the Content Manager OnDemand Server is stopped or WAS is stopped. 

Run the command slibclean. The slibclean command unloads all object files with load and use counts of 0. It can also be used to remove object files that are no longer used from both the shared library region and in the shared library and kernel text regions by removing object files that are no longer required. Doing this will allow the installation to complete without errors.
