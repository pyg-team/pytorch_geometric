QUESTION
 Are PVU values missing from Hardware/Processors page? 

ANSWER
It is normal and expected that there is no PVU information on 
Processors panel for cluster because hypothetically clusters can 
consists from a not homogeneous ESX server (with different processors). 
So it is possible that e.g. there are two server within one cluster but 
one with processors charged 70PVU per core and the second charged 50PVU 
per core. 
So this is expected behavior to not show the PVU for clusters on 
Processors panel and that the processor type is 'Cluster x86 All'. 

This was changed in ILMT 7.2.2. Starting from 7.2.2 all PVU 
calculations are being done on the physical server layer (not on the 
cluster layer any more). So in 7.2.2 customer will not see the clusters 
in Processors panel but the physical ESX server on which particular 
virtual machines currently are (with the correct processor and PVU 
information). 
The changes in 7.2.2 version was done due to changes in PVU counting 
rules introduced by IBM SWG pricing team. The new PVU 
counting rules has not been announced yet by IBM SWG pricing team so in 
case of any question on how the new rules for counting the PVU 
subcapacity will look like please ask the IBM SWG pricing team directly 
(subcap@us.ibm.com).
