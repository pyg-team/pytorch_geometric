   Restriction Explanation
   .
   This Memory Allocation Failure is occuring because
   of the huge data-size and the huge amount of
   details present in the drawing view.
   The machine used by the user is not adequate to
   handle this data.
   It is recommended that the user uses a 64-bit
   machine, with a RAm of 3 Ghz or more.
   Also, please request the user to refer to the
