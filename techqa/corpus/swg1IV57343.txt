APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The actions menu intermittently does not populate after
   selecting a target. Sometimes it appears to be browser
   specific, but has occurred on both Firefox and IE and Chrome.
   We rebooted the server and the problem resolves.
   .
   It seemed to occur on ALL Targets panel, however; was also
   recreated from other lists.
   .
   Found one definite way to recreate this error is to use the
   browser back button rather than the RC-back on the panel, once
   the problem occurs, closing the browser does not resolve
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  kill the two trc-gui related processes then restart the browser
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected
   Platform affected: All (Windows + Linux)
   Version affected: 8.2.1, 9.0.1, and 9.1.0
   Component: Server
   
   Problem description:
   The Action menu on the left side of the page is not visible when
   you selecta target in the All Targets report. This problem
   occurs intermittently and is more common with some browsers than
   others.
   
   Problem summary:
   Due to the way that the menus and actions are generated
   dynamically by using javascript, a timing issue can occur. This
   issue happens when one script is run before another, but the
   script being run first depends on some data from the other
   script. This causes some of the menus (including the Actions
   Menu) not to be populated with their entries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will be included in
   5.1.2-TIV-TRC512-IF0016
   8.2.1-TIV-TEMRC821-IF0006
   9.0.1-TIV-IEMRC901-IF0002
