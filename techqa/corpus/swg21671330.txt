Text:
WMB; IIB; Tomcat SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple security vulnerabilities identified in Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 (CVE-2013-4286, CVE-2013-4322, CVE-2014-0050) 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2013-4286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286]
Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.47, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC3, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector is used, does not properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification of a request's length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1) multiple Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090. [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160]

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE ID: CVE-2013-4322 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322]
Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 processes chunked transfer coding without properly handling (1) a large total amount of chunked data or (2) whitespace characters in an HTTP header value within a trailer field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3544. 

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)


CVE ID: CVE-2014-0050 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0050]
MultipartStream.java in Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.1, as used in Apache Tomcat, JBoss Web, and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted Content-Type header that bypasses a loop's intended exit conditions. 

CVSS
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90987 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90987] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
