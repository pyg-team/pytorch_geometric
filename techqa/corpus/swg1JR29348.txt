ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product: JCA JDBC adapter 6.x (mainly 6.0.2.3)
   
   Description: When the adapter tries to retrieve data from a
    database, and there is no entry for the requested keys then
    the adapter throws a recordNotFoundException instead of simply
    an empty or null object.
   
    Since finding no entries happens potentially often the error
    messages would cause huge logs.
    Further on such a case often is not seen as an error by
    processing logic.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  During retrieveAll operation, adapter throws
   RecordNotFoundException when no records are returned from the
   database. As part of this fix, a new property called
   ErrorOnEmptyResultset has been added on the Managed Connection
   Factory. The default value for this property is true and will
   result in current behaviour, i.e. if no rows are returned for
   the RetrieveAll operation, a RecordNotFoundException is thrown.
   If you want to override the behavior for retrieveAll operation
   then you can change the value for this property through admin
   console and set it to false after deploying the application. In
   this case, adapter will not throw an exception and return an
   empty container when no records are found after processing the
   retrieveAll operation. This property is not configurable through
   EMD in this fix, and has to be changed in the Admin Console. In
   the 6.2 release, this property will be added to the EMD code as
   well.

   interim fix version 6.0.2.3IF5.
