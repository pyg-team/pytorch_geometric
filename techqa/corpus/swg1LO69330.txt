ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Single logon does not work as expected when scheduled password
   reset set on Active Directory occurs and then change password
   with OS.
   Password does not sync after changing password with OS.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Prepare an account on active directory and apply a group
   policy.
   In the group policy, set Maximum password age like 1 or 2 days.
   2. Install and setup Notes client.
   3. Close Notes client and OS.
   4. After the Maximum password age is passed, start windows and
   login.
   Here, a prompt appears and requires to change login password.
   5. After changing login password successfully, start Notes
   Client.
   Then following message appears.
   
   Message:
   Your Windows password does not match your Notes password. You
   may change your password at any time via File - Security -
   User Security.  Wouldyou like to change your Notes password
   immediately after logging in?
   
   This issue does not occur every time the password is expired.
   It occasionally occurs.
   When this issue occurs, user's ID file is also updated at the
   time OS password is changed.
   However, if a user tries to login with a new OS password after
   a message above appears, an error generates and login fails.
   If former password is used here, the user successfully login to
   Notes.
