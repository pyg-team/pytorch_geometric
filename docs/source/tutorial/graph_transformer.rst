Graph Transformer
=================

`Transformer <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>`_ is an effictive architecture in `natural language processing <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>`_ and `computer vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929>`_.
Recently, there have been some applications(`Grover <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02835>`_, `GraphGPS <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454>`_, etc) that combine transformers on graphs.
In this tutorial, we will present how to build a graph transformer model via :pyg:`PyG`.

Transformers on Graphs
------------------------------

Compared to Graph Transformers, MPNNs have several drawbacks: (1) WL test: 1-order MPNNs have limited expressivity; (2) Over-smoothing: the features tend to
converage to the same value while increasing the number of GNN layers; (3) Over-squashing: Losing information when trying to aggregate messages from many neighbors into a single vector;
(4) Cannot capture long-range dependencies.

Feeding the whole graph into the Transformer also brings several pros and cons

**Pros**

* Computation graph structure is decoupled from the input graph structure.
* Long-range connections can be handled as all nodes are connected to each other.

**Cons**

* Loss of inductive bias that enables GNNs to work so well on graphs with pronounced locality. Particularly in graphs where edges represent relatedness/closeness.
* Language input is squential, but graphs are permutation invariant to node ordering.
* Square computational complexity :math:`O(N^2)` in the number of nodes whereas message passing GNNs are linear in the number of edges :math:`O(E)`. Graphs are often sparse :math:`N \approx E`.

Attention
+++++++++

.. math::
    Q = XW_Q, K = XW_K, V = XW_V
.. math::
    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V

In Transformer, attention can be multi-head, which consists of multiple attention weights.

Positional and Structural Encodings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We organized PE/SE into 3 categories based on their locality: (1) Local, (2) Global, (3) Relative.
Positional encodings (PE) provides an idea of the position in space of a given node within the graph. When two nodes are close to each other within a graph or subgraph, their PE should also be close.
Structure encodings (SE) provides an embedding of the structure of graphs or subgraphs to help increasing the expressivity and the generalizability of GNNs.
When two nodes share similar subgraphs, or when two graphs are similar, their SE should also be close.

     - (1)Node degree; (2)Random walk diagonals; (3) Enumerate substructures(triangles, rings).
   * - Global (node)
     - (1)Eigenvectors of A/L or distance matrix; (2)Distance to graph's centroid; (3)Unique ID for each node.
     - (1)Eigenvalues of A/L; (2) Graph diameter, girth, degree, etc.
   * - Relative (edge)
     - (1)Pair-wise distance from: Heat Kernels, Random Walks, Graph geodesic, etc; (2)Gradient of eigenvectors
     - (1)Gradient of any Local SE; (2)Gradient of sub-structure enumeration

GPS Layer and GraphGPS Model
--------------------------------------

Firstly, we introduce the GPS layer, which is combined with local MPNN and global Transformer, and then followed by 2-layer MLP and skip-connecttions.
Local MPNN can provide locality bias that is difficult or expensive to achieve in Transformer.
In addition, features of edges can be updated and encoded into the node features(`GatedGCN <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07553>`_, `GINE <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265>`_).
Transformer can utilize positional and structural encodings. As we don't need to consider edge features, We can use the existing linear Transformer architecture to reduce the time complexity from :math:`O(N^2)` to :math:`O(N + E)`, like `Performer <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794>`_ and `BigBird <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062>`_.

.. warning::
    `BigBird <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062>`_ currently is not supported, will be added in the future.

The update function of each layer is described by the equations below.

Local MPNN
++++++++++

.. math::
    \hat{X}_M^{l + 1}, E^{l + 1} = MPNN_e^l(X^l, E^l, A)
.. math::
    X_M^{l + 1} = BatchNorm(Dropout(\hat{X}_M^{l + 1}) + X^l)

.. code-block:: python

    h = self.conv(x, edge_index, **kwargs)
    h = F.dropout(h, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)
    h = h + x
    if self.norm1 is not None:
        if self.norm_with_batch:
            h = self.norm1(h, batch=batch)
        else:
            h = self.norm1(h)
    hs.append(h)

Global Attention
++++++++++++++++

.. math::
    \hat{X}_T^{l + 1} = GlobalAttn^l(X^l)
.. math::
    X_T^{l + 1} = BatchNorm(Dropout(\hat{X}_T^{l + 1}) + X^l)

.. code-block:: python

    h, mask = to_dense_batch(x, batch)

    if isinstance(self.attn, torch.nn.MultiheadAttention):
        h, _ = self.attn(h, h, h, key_padding_mask=~mask,
                        need_weights=False)
    elif isinstance(self.attn, PerformerAttention):
        h = self.attn(h, mask=mask)

    h = h[mask]
    h = F.dropout(h, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)
    h = h + x  # Residual connection.
    if self.norm2 is not None:
        if self.norm_with_batch:
            h = self.norm2(h, batch=batch)
        else:
            h = self.norm2(h)
    hs.append(h)

Combine local and global outputs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. math::
    X^{l + 1} = MLP^l(X_M^{l + 1} + X_T^{l + 1})

.. code-block:: python

    out = sum(hs)

    out = out + self.mlp(out)
    if self.norm3 is not None:
        if self.norm_with_batch:
            out = self.norm3(out, batch=batch)
        else:
            out = self.norm3(out)

Next, we introduce GraphGPS architecture. The difference between `GraphGPS <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454>`_ and `GraphTrans <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08821>`_ is the organization of MPNN and transformer.
In GraphTrans, a few layers of MPNNs are comprised before the Transformer, which may be limited by problems of over-smoothing, over-squashing and low expressivity agianst the WL test.
These layers could irreparably fail to keep some information in the early stage. The design of GraphGPS is a stacking of MPNN + transformer hybrid, which resolves
the local expressivity bottlenecks by allowing information to spread across the graph via full-connectivity.
