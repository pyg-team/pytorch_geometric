To build the documentation:

1. [Build and install](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-pytorch-geometric) PyG from source.
1. Install [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) theme via
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg_sphinx_theme.git
   ```
1. Generate the documentation file via:
